(Nasdaq: ONCT) (the “Company”) today announced updated data from its Phase 1/2 Study of ONCT-534 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).\n\nBased on initial pharmacokinetic results, two additional dosing cohorts with twice daily (BID) oral dosing of ONCT-534 had been incorporated in the Phase 1/2 study ONCT-534-101 (NCT05917470). Overall, fifteen patients received ONCT-534 once daily (QD) in six dosing cohorts and six patients received ONCT-534 BID in two dosing cohorts. Based on a data cut off of September 30, 2024, the BID dosing schedule was well tolerated, with no related Grade 3 or higher toxicities. One patient, who experienced a rising PSA on ONCT-534 at 160 mg BID, had a subsequent 50% reduction in PSA after four weeks of ONCT-534 at 300 mg BID, and at the same time the CAT Scan showed a 16% reduction in target lesions compared to baseline. Enumeration and biomarker analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) showed promising effects on expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes, and AR nuclear translocation in six additional patients. CTC analysis also showed that some patients who did not respond to ONCT-534 had prostate cancer that had developed neuroendocrine features, which are associated with AR independent disease.\n\n“While we still believe the decision to discontinue the ONCT-534-101 clinical trial remains the correct one in the current biotechnology environment, the updated clinical results highlight the potential of ONCT-534 in prostate cancer. We believe there is value in exploring BID dosing further, as well as studying ONCT-534 in earlier lines of therapy for advanced prostate cancer,” said James Breitmeyer, M.D., Ph.D., Oncternal’s President and CEO. “We continue to explore strategic alternatives for our product candidates, including ONCT-534, ONCT-808, zilovertamab and ONCT-216 in an ongoing effort to maximize value to our shareholders.”\n\n**About Oncternal Therapeutics**Oncternal Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for the treatment of patients with cancers that have critical unmet medical need.

Tumorigenic fusion proteins involving the EWS protein and an ETS protein can be found in most cases of Ewing sarcoma. ETS-related translocations or overexpression are also found in many other tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prostate cancer. In preclinical models, ONCT-216 was observed to bind to EWS-FLI1, blocking the interaction between this fusion protein and other transcriptome proteins such as RNA helicase A, leading to tumor cell apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth in animal models. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Status to ONCT-216 for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. The results of a Phase 1/ 2 clinical trial of ONCT-216 in patients with Ewing sarcoma ([NCT02657005](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2yTYtpmBO6pC7NItva8VEko8B_dmJBF3d2osUvEK5P8HAS6VpNxbYZY-K89hJbIl_4mMAvmXHOS5GjDkjqXVQ1kQQmpRk3XymPhB82vl2-c=)) were recently published ([Myers 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XbCuq-bWboTASSqXongUULEnbktZQ7rzfR29ZXN5CmHyMDfinnP_Yvfvn1ucfIqaJREXLao1MBtcX2nOIBD-idVeKGoml5Ybtltlg0ZyXicOD4Re8vJjNnz7mgh4VbEam2fs9dORMhvi4aROUc6f6_8vnh__DbSANtCafRFlWHQ6mvw27440p0g_dNM2JrxC)).\n\n**Forward-Looking Information** Oncternal cautions you that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: ONCT) (the “Company”) today announced its decision to discontinue its clinical trials evaluating ONCT-534, its dual action androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant cancer, and ONCT-808, its ROR1-targeting autologous CAR T program for the treatment of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and to explore strategic alternatives.\n\nIn the current study, interim Phase 1 results of ONCT-534 did not show clinically meaningful improvements of disease, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, in the 20 patients treated in eight dosing cohorts with various doses and schedules of administration of ONCT-534. ONCT-534 was generally well tolerated, with dose limiting toxicity observed in 2 of 3 patients at the highest dose tested, 1200 mg given orally once per day.\n\nThe results with ONCT-808 at an interim Phase 1 analysis showed anti-tumor activity at every dose tested, including a complete metabolic response lasting eight months and long-term persistence of the CAR-T cells, with expected treatment emergent adverse events for a CAR-T therapy, and one death due to complications of shock at the highest dose tested.\n\nBased on the available clinical data and capital requirements for continued development, the Company has decided to terminate these studies. The Company will focus on exploring strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for its stockholders, which may include asset sales, licensing or other strategic transactions relating to the Company’s development programs or a merger, reverse merger, acquisition, or other business combination involving the Company. While this strategic exploration is ongoing, the Company will discontinue all product development activities and will take other steps to reduce costs, including a reduction in its workforce to preserve cash resources.\n\n“The early results during dose escalation in the Phase 1/2 studies of ONCT-534 in heavily pretreated patients are disappointing, as the study was supported by extensive preclinical data and was designed to address important unmet medical needs for patients with advanced prostate cancer,” said James Breitmeyer, M.D., Ph.D., Oncternal’s President and CEO. “In light of these data and the challenging financing environment, we intend to explore strategic options with the hope of advancing and realizing value from our pipeline including ONCT-534, ONCT-808, zilovertamab and ONCT-216.”\n\n**About Oncternal Therapeutics**Oncternal Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for the treatment of patients with cancers that have critical unmet medical need.

Tumorigenic fusion proteins involving the EWS protein and an ETS protein can be found in most cases of Ewing sarcoma. ETS-related translocations or overexpression are also found in many other tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prostate cancer. In preclinical models, ONCT-216 was observed to bind to EWS-FLI1, blocking the interaction between this fusion protein and other transcriptome proteins such as RNA helicase A, leading to tumor cell apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth in animal models. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Status to ONCT-216 for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. The results of a Phase 1/ 2 clinical trial of ONCT-216 in patients with Ewing sarcoma ([NCT02657005](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=06sePaZX3rk6rTHE1_iqo_2e03cvso7pvMHnL2Iv7cArh4mU5wRc0BvaTBD6ZaZC2iGhRMaqvLtyE01do6fFZKVhaa-wR6nn9aJga5NbfSRe2O_QfGp6dnlXM19BPxhl)) were recently published ([Myers 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6R0IWaWJYSAcSo5Wes1GUlSErGteMRa5Gu3CbthWbj9BeAH1VdqGxaAnspSoJr8zYK-j1CpeCZ4g_rvf6VDTlkkypwxtWuqWo0ETXhVFPpJ7kAGaItJhZHnPxoo116oxMCYXse1cmnAbpGKoIU36vmnZ4hqS1RGg_nmsJOZxPOiE68sPrNPYga-naaPKf_YJHfCORsUTlJjny-WaScXqWw==)).\n\n**Forward-Looking Information** Oncternal cautions you that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: ONCT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies, today provided a business update and reported second quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n“Our Phase 1/2 study of ONCT-534 in patients with R/R mCRPC continues to advance through dose escalation cohorts without dose-limiting toxicities or concerning side effects. We are encouraged by the high pace of enrollment in the study and look forward to sharing initial clinical and biomarker data later in the third quarter,” said James Breitmeyer, M.D., Ph.D., Oncternal’s President and CEO. “Our Phase 1/2 study of ONCT-808, our autologous ROR1 CAR T, is open and enrolling patients. We remain encouraged we will find the optimal dose to address the high unmet need of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B cell lymphoma, including those who have relapsed after CD19 CAR T treatment.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * In July 2024, we announced that enrollment was complete and three patients dosed in the sixth cohort of our Phase 1/2 study of ONCT-534 for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer who are relapsed or refractory to approved androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI). Patients in the sixth dosing cohort are being given 1200 mg of ONCT-534 orally once per day.\n  * Our dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1/2 Study ONCT-808-101, evaluating our ROR1-targeting autologous CAR T cell therapy, ONCT-808, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including patients that have failed prior CD19 CAR T treatment, is open and enrolling patients. Protocol changes that include modified eligibility criteria, increased monitoring for early infection, and evaluating lower doses of ONCT-808 have now been implemented.\n\n\n\n**Expected Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * ONCT-534, our dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor \n    * Initial clinical data in the third quarter of 2024\n    * Additional clinical data readouts in the fourth quarter of 2024\n  * ONCT-808, our autologous ROR1-targeted CAR T cell therapy \n    * Clinical data update in the fourth quarter of 2024\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Our grant revenue was $0.8 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Our total operating expenses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $9.7 million, including $1.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses for the quarter totaled $6.6 million, and general and administrative expenses for the quarter totaled $3.1 million. Net loss for the first quarter was $8.6 million, or a net loss of $2.89 per share, basic and diluted. As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock outstanding, $21.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt. These funds are expected to be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**About Oncternal Therapeutics**Oncternal Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for the treatment of patients with cancers that have critical unmet medical need. Oncternal pursues drug development targeting promising, yet untapped biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression, focusing on hematological malignancies and prostate cancer. [ONCT-534](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pWlW_d4vmYKM-sG30mz-K-19ZBak232jOVtgncQl09N3cNWaIINKN8K5vdZoXT4pkXfXK3ypQTRQ7GOCxY5dcaFi8rM0675-EkY_HZoXSDo=) is an investigational dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor (DAARI) with demonstrated preclinical activity in prostate cancer models against both unmutated androgen receptor (AR), and against multiple forms of AR aberration. It is a potential treatment for patients with mCRPC with unmet medical need because of resistance to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, including those with AR amplification, mutations in the AR ligand binding domain (LBD), or splice variants with loss of the AR LBD.

We are encouraged by the high pace of enrollment in the study and look forward to sharing initial clinical and biomarker data later in the third quarter,” said James Breitmeyer, M.D., Ph.D., Oncternal’s President and CEO. “Our Phase 1/2 study of ONCT-808, our autologous ROR1 CAR T, is open and enrolling patients. We remain encouraged we will find the optimal dose to address the high unmet need of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B cell lymphoma, including those who have relapsed after CD19 CAR T treatment.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * In July 2024, we announced that enrollment was complete and three patients dosed in the sixth cohort of our Phase 1/2 study of ONCT-534 for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer who are relapsed or refractory to approved androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI). Patients in the sixth dosing cohort are being given 1200 mg of ONCT-534 orally once per day.\n  * Our dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1/2 Study ONCT-808-101, evaluating our ROR1-targeting autologous CAR T cell therapy, ONCT-808, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including patients that have failed prior CD19 CAR T treatment, is open and enrolling patients. Protocol changes that include modified eligibility criteria, increased monitoring for early infection, and evaluating lower doses of ONCT-808 have now been implemented.\n\n\n\n**Expected Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * ONCT-534, our dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor \n    * Initial clinical data in the third quarter of 2024\n    * Additional clinical data readouts in the fourth quarter of 2024\n  * ONCT-808, our autologous ROR1-targeted CAR T cell therapy \n    * Clinical data update in the fourth quarter of 2024\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Our grant revenue was $0.8 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Our total operating expenses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $9.7 million, including $1.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses for the quarter totaled $6.6 million, and general and administrative expenses for the quarter totaled $3.1 million. Net loss for the first quarter was $8.6 million, or a net loss of $2.89 per share, basic and diluted. As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock outstanding, $21.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt.
