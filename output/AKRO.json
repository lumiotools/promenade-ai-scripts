(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKRO), a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, today announced results of analyses supporting the clinical activity of efruxifermin (EFX) in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in one oral presentation and two late-breaking poster presentations at the 75th Annual American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting**®** , held November 15-19, 2024, in San Diego.\n\n“The data to be presented at The Liver Meeting**®** show that 96 weeks of treatment with EFX has the potential to drive substantial reversal of disease in patients living with pre-cirrhotic MASH,” said Kitty Yale, chief development officer of Akero. “We are encouraged by consistent improvements observed across a number of clinically established markers of liver health and the corroboration of conventional histopathology assessments with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based digital pathology. We believe these new analyses provide further evidence for the potential of EFX to be a differentiated therapy for MASH.”\n\nAn oral presentation will highlight findings from the completed 96-week Phase 2b HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stages F2-F3. These findings include assessment of liver biopsies by conventional histopathology and AI-based digital pathology, as well as analyses of individual participants’ responses across clinically established measures of liver fibrosis:\n\n  * AI-based digital pathology scoring of fibrosis (by HistoIndex, using their proprietary qFibrosis scoring) corroborated the EFX-associated histopathologic improvements scored by per-protocol consensus reads, and highlighted statistically significant EFX-associated reductions in qFibrosis® in both the perisinusoidal and periportal zones of the liver after 24 and 96 weeks of treatment.\n  * In addition, analysis of changes in multi-modal, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis among individual participants showed that: \n    * More than half of individuals treated with EFX 50mg experienced clinically meaningful reductions in _both_ widely used non-invasive tests of fibrosis (liver stiffness by FibroScan® vibration-controlled transient elastrography [VCTE] and Enhanced Liver Fibrosis [ELFTM] Test), approximately nine-fold the rate of placebo.\n    * Over 40% of individuals treated with EFX 50mg for 96 weeks experienced improved fibrosis by conventional histopathology, **_as well as_** clinically meaningful improvements in imaging (liver stiffness by FibroScan®) and serum (ELFTM score) biomarkers of liver fibrosis, compared with 0% of individuals on placebo.\n    * The proportion of individuals who responded to EFX 28 mg was smaller than that for EFX 50mg based on these same measures:\n\n\n\n**Proportions of Participants with Improved Liver Fibrosis as Indicated by Congruence of Improvements in Non-Invasive Markers of Fibrosis****and Conventional Histopathology After EFX Treatment**\n\n**Responder Type (Proportion of Participants)****1**| **Placebo****(N=32)**| **EFX 28mg****(N=26)**| **EFX 50mg****(N=24)**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**ELF****TM**(≥0.5 absolute reduction in score)| 25| %| 58| %| 71| %  \n**Liver Stiffness**(≥30% relative reduction by FibroScan® VCTE)| 19| %| 50| %| 71| %  \n**ELF****TM****+ Liver Stiffness**|  6| %| 38| %| 54| %  \n**ELF****TM****+ Liver Stiffness + Histopathology****2**|  0| %| 19| %| 42| %  \n  \n1 Based on those patients with baseline and Week 96 measurements of ELFTM score, liver stiffness (FibroScan®), and conventional histopathology2 Fibrosis improvement ≥1 stage without MASH worsening, by conventional histopathology\n\nOne poster (#5047) presents an orthogonal analysis of baseline, week 24, and week 96 liver biopsies from HARMONY by HistoIndex. This analysis corroborates the pattern of anti-fibrotic effects observed with conventional pathology after treatment with EFX for 24 or 96 weeks. Specifically, a quantitative analysis by qFibrosis® across different zones of the liver revealed EFX-associated reductions in fibrosis primarily in the perisinusoidal and periportal zones that were sustained or expanded from weeks 24 through 96 for participants, regardless of baseline fibrosis stage.\n\nThe second poster (#5021) presentation shows that 30% of participants receiving EFX 50mg for 96 weeks had almost complete reversal of MASH-related disease, as indicated by reversal of fibrosis to F≤1, resolution of MASH, and normalization of liver fat content to ≤5%, compared to 0% of participants on placebo. In addition, 100% of participants who received EFX 50mg for 96 weeks were categorized as “low risk of progressive MASH” (i.e., MASH with F≥2, NAS≥4) by FibroScan®-AST (FAST) score. In contrast, 48% of participants receiving placebo remained at high or indeterminate risk of progressive MASH. Based on the same analyses, the extent of reversal of disease relative to placebo was smaller for participants receiving EFX 28mg than 50mg.\n\n“We believe that, taken together, the suite of presentations provides evidence supporting the consistent anti-fibrotic effects of EFX observed to date in the HARMONY trial as well as the the clinical activity and generally favorable safety profile of EFX in patients with precirrhotic MASH (F2-F3). The ongoing Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program is designed to confirm a favorable benefit-risk profile and support marketing applications for EFX for the treatment of MASH,” said Ms. Yale.\n\nDetails for the presentations are as follows:\n\n**Title:** Efruxifermin Significantly Improved Liver Fibrosis at Week 96 in the HARMONY Study Across Subgroups and Improvements Were Associated With Changes in Biomarkers**Speaker:** Mazen Noureddin, M.D., M.H.Sc., Professor of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Director, Houston Research Institute**Date/Time:** Sunday, November 17, 2024, from 2:00 PM – 2:15 PM PST **Publication Number:** 158**Oral Session:** MASLD and MASH – New Therapies\n\n**Title:** AI and digital-based pathology corroborate reduction in fibrosis observed by conventional pathology with efruxifermin treatment of patients with F2-F3 MASH in the HARMONY study**Presenter:** Mazen Noureddin, M.D., M.H.Sc., Professor of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Director, Houston Research Institute **Date/Time:** Monday, November 18, 2024, from 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM PST**Publication Number:** 5047**Session:** Late Breaking Posters\n\n**Title:** Efruxifermin significantly reduced proportion of subjects with at-risk MASH and led to near-complete histological disease reversal at week 96 in the HARMONY study**Presenter:** Mazen Noureddin, M.D., M.H.Sc., Professor of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Director, Houston Research Institute **Date/Time:** Monday, November 18, 2024, from 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM PST **Publication Number:** 5021**Session:** Late Breaking Posters\n\n**About Akero Therapeutics** Akero Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including MASH.
