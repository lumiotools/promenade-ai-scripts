REPORTS NET PROFIT OF $81.3 MILLION\nFOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2024,\nAND DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.60 PER SHARE\nATHENS, GREECE, November 19, 2024 – Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (the \"Company\" or \"Star Bulk\") (Nasdaq: SBLK), a global\nshipping company focusing on the transportation of dry bulk cargoes, today announced its unaudited financial and operating\nresults for the third quarter of 2024. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in\nthis press release to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or similar references, mean Star Bulk Carriers Corp. and, where applicable, its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.\nFinancial Highlights\n(1) Adjusted Net income, Adjusted earnings per share basic and Adjusted earnings per share diluted are non-GAAP measures. Please see EXHIBIT I at the\nend of this release for a reconciliation to Net income and earnings per share, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated\nand presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), as well as for the definition of each\nmeasure.\n(2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP liquidity measures. Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a reconciliation of EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by / (Used in) Operating Activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and\npresented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as for the definition of each measure. To derive Adjusted EBITDA from EBITDA, we exclude certain\nnon-cash gains / (losses).\n(3) Daily Time Charter Equivalent Rate (“TCE”) and TCE Revenues are non-GAAP measures. Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a\nreconciliation to Voyage Revenues, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe definition of each measure is provided in footnote (7) to the Summary of Selected Data table below.\n(4) Daily OPEX per vessel is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by Ownership days (defined below). Daily OPEX per vessel (as adjusted) is\ncalculated by dividing vessel operating expenses excluding increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic or pre-delivery expenses for each vessel\non acquisition or change of management, if any, by Ownership days. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain\nexpenses (as described above) that were previously excluded.\n(5) Daily Net Cash G&A expenses per vessel is calculated by (1) adding the Management fee expense to the General and Administrative expenses, net of\nshare-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges and (2) then dividing the result by the sum of Ownership days and Charter-in days\n(defined below).

Consistent with our stated capital allocation policy, our Board of Directors has\napproved a dividend distribution of $0.60 / share.\nOur Company remains focused on creating long term value for our shareholders. Since the beginning of 2021,\nthrough 15 consecutive dividend payments, we have returned operational free cash flow after debt service of\nmore than $1.33 billion. At the same time we have taken advantage of elevated vessel values having sold 29\nvessels, generating gross proceeds of $563 million. Part of these funds have been used opportunistically for share\nrepurchases amounting to $443 million, at prices significantly below NAV, crystalizing a valuation arbitrage.\nSubstantial remaining cash is kept in reserve for future opportunities for fleet renewal, share repurchases or debt\nrepayment. Finally, we have strengthened our financial position having reduced our Net Debt (per vessel) over\nthe same period by 53%.\nWe continue our work on creating an enlarged, best in class, management platform utilizing the virtues of all ex-\nEagle and Star Bulk personnel, systems and processes. As we optimize our daily operations, reducing operating\nand G&A expenses as well as financing and drydock cost, we have already achieved significant synergies since the\nEagle Bulk merger closed in early April.\nOn the financing front, we have received approval for a new $130m debt facility to finance the delivery of our five\nlatest generation high specification eco Kamsarmax Newbuilding vessels delivering in Q4 2025 and H1 2026 in\nChina. With this seven-year post-delivery financing in place and the equity for the vessels already secured, the\nvessels are now fully financed on very competitive terms.\nRegarding the dry bulk market, we remain optimistic about its medium-term prospects given the favorable supply\npicture, stricter environmental regulations, and recent steps by the Chinese government to stimulate the\neconomy.\nIn a period of increased geopolitical uncertainties, we remain focused on actively managing our diverse scrubber-\nfitted fleet to take advantage of market opportunities.”\nRecent Developments\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn November 19, 2024, pursuant to our dividend policy, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60\nper share, payable on or about December 18, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of December 5, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program & Shares Outstanding Update\nIn September 2024, we repurchased 933,004 common shares in open market transactions at an average price of $20.61 per\nshare for an aggregate consideration of $19.23 million pursuant to the $50.0 million share repurchase program announced\nin May 2023. All of the abovementioned shares were cancelled and removed from our share capital as of the date of this\nrelease.\nAs of the date of this release, we have 117,892,303 shares outstanding and $28.9 million outstanding under our share\nrepurchase program.\nFleet Update\nVessels’ S&P\nIn connection with the previously announced vessel sales, the vessel Star Iris was delivered to its new owners during the\nthird quarter of 2024. Additionally, on September 3, 2024, we agreed to sell the vessel Star Triumph, which was delivered\nto its new owners on September 17, 2024. Furthermore, in September 2024, we agreed to sell the vessels Imperial Eagle\nand Diva, which, along with the previously announced sale of the vessel Star Hydrus, are expected to be delivered to their\nnew owners within the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOverall, in connection with the sales of the three vessels that will be completed within the fourth quarter of 2024, as\ndescribed above, we expect to collect total gross proceeds of $50.15 million, and a gain on sale of approximately $10.5\nmillion. We have also made debt prepayments of approximately $16.47 million in connection with these three vessel sales.\nCharter-In Vessels\nIn October 2024 and November 2024, we took delivery of Star Illusion and Star Thetis, a newbuilding Kamsarmax and a\nnewbuilding Ultramax vessel, built in Tsuneishi Zhousan and Tsuneishi Cebu, respectively, both subject to seven-year\ncharter-in agreements.\nAs of the date of this release on a fully delivered basis and as adjusted for the delivery of a) the vessels already agreed to be\nsold and b) the five firm Kamsarmax vessels currently under construction, we own a fleet of 156 vessels, with an aggregate\ncapacity of 15.0 million deadweight ton (“dwt”) consisting of 17 Newcastlemax, 15 Capesize, 1 Mini Capesize, 7 Post\nPanamax, 44 Kamsarmax, 1 Panamax, 48 Ultramax and 23 Supramax vessels with carrying capacities between 53,489 dwt\nand 209,537 dwt. In addition, we operate under long-term charter-in contracts 1 Capesize, 4 Kamsarmax and 2 Ultramax\nvessels with an approximate charter duration of seven years.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nFollowing a number of interest rate swaps we have entered into, we currently have an outstanding total notional amount\nof $118.3 million under our financing agreements with an average fixed rate of 63 bps and an average remaining maturity\nof 0.9 years. As of September 30, 2024, the Mark-to-Market value of our outstanding interest rate swaps stood at $4.2\nmillion, and our cumulative net realized gain amounted to $37.0 million.\nFinancing Update\nIn October 2024, we signed with one of our existing lenders a committed term sheet for the post-delivery financing of the\nfive Kamsarmax vessels currently under construction. The financing amount is up to $130.0 million, and the term of the loan\nis seven years from the draw-down date.\nIn October 2024, one tranche of the ABN $97.5 million facility secured by 6 vessels (Star Pauline, Star Angie, Star Sophia,\nStar Georgia, Star Nina and Star Kamilla) of the Company matured, and the relevant tranche was repaid in full. Consequently,\nthe relevant ship mortgages on these 6 vessels were removed, and the vessels are now free of encumbrances.\nAs of the date of this press release, the Company has 9 unencumbered vessels, including the 3 vessels sold but not delivered\nmentioned above.\nVessel Employment Overview\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate (“TCE rate”) is a non-GAAP measure. Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a\nreconciliation to Voyage Revenues, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOur TCE rate per day per main vessel category was as follows:\nCP\nU\na p e so\ns t P\nltra m\nize / Na\nn a m\na x / S\nea\nu\nw c a sx\n/ K a\np ra m\ntle mm\ns a\na x V\na x V e s srm\na x / P\ne s s e ls :\nea lsn :a\nm a x V e s s e ls :\n$\n$\n$\nT h ird q\n2\n1\n1\nu\n86\n6\na rte r\n2 0 2 4\n,7 9 2\n,1 6 1\n,0 2 3\n$\n$\n$\nN in e m o n th s\ne n d e d\nS e p te m b e r 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 4\n2 8 ,5 1 2\n1 5 ,9 1 9\n1 6 ,2 9 0\nAmounts shown throughout the press release and variations in period–over–period comparisons are derived from the actual\nunaudited numbers in our books and records. Reference to per share figures below are based on 117,086,980 and 96,139,203\nweighted average diluted shares for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThird Quarter 2024 and 2023 Results\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we had a net income of $81.3 million, or $0.69 earnings per share, compared to a net income\nfor the third quarter of 2023 of $43.7 million, or $0.45 earnings per share. Adjusted net income, which excludes certain non-\ncash items, was $82.7 million, or $0.71 earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an adjusted net income\nof $33.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, or $0.34 earnings per share.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $138.0 million, compared to $67.1 million for the\nthird quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain non-cash items, was $144.4 million for the third quarter of\n2024, compared to $84.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nVoyage revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $344.3 million from $223.1 million in the third quarter of 2023\nand Time charter equivalent revenues (“TCE Revenues”)1 increased to $256.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared\nto $162.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, mainly driven by the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet\nto 155.3 from 121.5, during the relevant periods and the improved charter rates. TCE rate for the third quarter of 2024 was\n$18,843 compared to $15,068 for the third quarter of 2023 which is indicative of the stronger market conditions prevailing\nduring the recent quarter.\nCharter-in hire expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.8 million from $4.2 million in the third quarter of\n2023. This increase is mainly attributable to the increase in charter-in days to 870 in the third quarter of 2024 from 204 in\nthe corresponding period in 2023.\nVessel operating expenses for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 amounted to $75.5 million and $54.9 million, respectively.\nDaily operating expenses per vessel amounted to $5,287 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4,914 for the\ncorresponding period of 2023. Excluding pre-delivery expenses, daily operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024\namounted to $5,114 compared to $4,851 for the corresponding quarter of 2023. The increase in our operating expenses\nwas primarily driven by the acquisition of the Eagle fleet which resulted in an increase in the average number of vessels in\nour fleet to 155.3 from 121.5 and the higher operating expenses of the legacy Eagle fleet, which we expect to further\nnormalize in the following quarters. The daily operating expenses per vessel excluding pre-delivery expenses of the legacy\nEagle fleet for the third quarter of 2024 amounted to $5,389, compared to daily operating expenses per vessel excluding\npre-delivery expenses of $4,987 for the Star Bulk fleet existing prior to the Eagle Merger.\nDry docking expenses for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $20.1 million and $11.6 million, respectively. In the third\nquarter of 2024 fourteen vessels completed their periodic dry docking surveys, compared to eight vessels which completed\ntheir dry docking during the third quarter of 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $21.6 million and $13.6 million,\nrespectively, which included share-based compensation of $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $6.3 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023. Vessel management fees in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $5.0 million compared to $4.3\nmillion for the corresponding period in 2023. Daily net cash G&A expenses per vessel amounted to $1,262 in the third quarter\nof 2024 versus $1,024 in the third quarter of 2023 and versus $1,371 in the second quarter of 2024. We expect that our daily\nnet cash G&A expenses will improve further during the following quarters as a result of synergies from the Eagle merger.\nDepreciation expense increased to $44.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $34.5 million for the\ncorresponding period in 2023. The fluctuation is primarily driven by the increase in the average number of vessels in our\nfleet to 155.3 from 121.5.\nOur results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 include a loss on write-down of inventories of $4.6 million and $0.8\nmillion, respectively, in connection with the valuation of the bunkers remaining on board our vessels, as a result of their\nlower net realizable value compared to their historical cost at each quarter end.\n1 Please see the table at the end of this release for the calculation of the TCE Revenues.\nOur results for the third quarter of 2024 include an aggregate net gain of $9.1 million which resulted from the completion\nof the sales of vessels as previously announced or as described above under the section “Fleet Update”. Our results for the\nthird quarter of 2023 included an aggregate net gain of $18.9 million which resulted from the completion of the sale of\ncertain vessels.\nInterest and finance costs for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $24.4 million and $18.1 million, respectively. The\ndriving factors for this increase are a) the higher base interest rates and the lower outstanding notional amount of our\ninterest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023 and b) the increase in\nour outstanding indebtedness as a result of the new debt drawn in order to refinance the previously outstanding debt of\nthe Eagle fleet.\nInterest income and other income/(loss) for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 amounted to $7.1 million and $3.7 million,\nrespectively. The increase in interest income and other income/(loss) is primarily attributable to a realized foreign exchange\ngain of $1.3 million resulting from the strengthening of the Euro/USD exchange rate in the third quarter of 2024, compared\nto a foreign exchange loss of $1.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Additionally, the higher interest rates earned\nand higher cash balances maintained during the third quarter of 2024 contributed to the increase compared to the\ncorresponding period in 2023.\nLoss on debt extinguishment for the third quarter of 2023 was $4.3 million and was primarily affected by write-offs of\nunamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the loan and lease prepayments in 2023.\nNo such loss was incurred in the third quarter of 2024.\nUnaudited Consolidated Income Statements\n(E x p re sse d in th o u sa n d s o f U .S . d o lla rs e x ce p t

Selected Data\n(1) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our owned fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of\ndays each operating vessel was a part of our owned fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\n(2) As of the last day of each period presented.\n(3) Average age of our operational fleet is calculated as of the end of each period.\n(4) Ownership days are the total calendar days each vessel in the fleet was owned by us for the relevant period, including vessels subject to sale and leaseback\ntransactions and finance leases.\n(5) Available days are the Ownership days after subtracting off-hire days for major repairs, dry docking or special or intermediate surveys, change of\nmanagement and vessels’ improvements and upgrades. The available days for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, were also decreased by\noff-hire days relating to disruptions in connection with crew changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our method of computing Available Days\nmay not necessarily be comparable to Available Days of other companies.\n(6) Charter-in days are the total days that we charter-in third party vessels.\n(7) Time charter equivalent rate represents the weighted average daily TCE rates of our operating fleet (including owned fleet and charter-in vessels). TCE\nrate is a measure of the average daily net revenue performance of our operating fleet. Our method of calculating TCE rate is determined by dividing (a) TCE\nRevenues, which consists of Voyage Revenues net of voyage expenses, charter-in hire expense, amortization of fair value of above/below market acquired\ntime charter agreements, if any, as well as adjusted for the impact of realized gain/(loss) on forward freight agreements (“FFAs”) and bunker swaps by (b)\nAvailable days for the relevant time period. Available days do not include the Charter-in days as per the relevant definitions provided above. Voyage expenses\nprimarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter\ncontract, as well as commissions. In the calculation of TCE Revenues, we also include the realized gain/(loss) on FFAs and bunker swaps as we believe that\nthis method better reflects the chartering result of our fleet and is more comparable to the method used by some of our peers. TCE Revenues and TCE rate,\nwhich are non-GAAP measures, provide additional meaningful information in conjunction with Voyage Revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure, because they assist our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and because we believe that they\nprovide useful information to investors regarding our financial performance. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily\nto compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., voyage charters, time charters,\nbareboat charters and pool arrangements) under which its vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of computing TCE Revenues and TCE\nrate may not necessarily be comparable to those of other companies. For a detailed calculation please see Exhibit I at the end of this release with the\nreconciliation of Voyage Revenues to TCE.\n(8) Daily OPEX per vessel is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by Ownership days. Daily OPEX per vessel (as adjusted) is calculated by dividing\nvessel operating expenses excluding increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic or pre-delivery expenses for each vessel on acquisition or change of\nmanagement, if any, by Ownership days. We exclude the abovementioned expenses that may occur occasionally from our Daily OPEX per vessel, since these\ngenerally represent items that we would not anticipate occurring as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that Daily OPEX per vessel\n(as adjusted) is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect to our operating cost performance since\nsuch measure eliminates the effects of the items described above, which may vary from period to period, are not part of our daily business and derive from\nreasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain expenses (as described\nabove) that were previously excluded. Vessel operating expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 included additional crew expenses\nrelated to the increased number and cost of crew changes performed during the period as a result of COVID-19 restrictions imposed in 2020 estimated to\n$2.1 million. In addition, vessel operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023, included pre-delivery expenses due to change of management of $0.7\nmillion, compared to $2.0 million of pre-delivery expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2024 due to change of management and acquisition of the Eagle\nfleet.\n(9) Please see Exhibit I at the end of this release for the reconciliation to General and administrative expenses, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nWe believe that Daily Net Cash G&A expenses per vessel is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect\nto our financial performance since such measure eliminates the effects of non-cash items which may vary from period to period, are not part of our daily\nbusiness and derive from reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain\nexpenses (as described above) that were previously excluded.\nANAOACDDDD v e ra g e n u m b e r o f v e s s e ls (1 )u\nm b e r o f v e s s e ls (2 )v\ne ra g e a g e o f o p e ra tio n a l fle e t (in y e aw\nn e rs h ip d a y s (4 )v\na ila b le d a y s (5 )h\na rte r-in d a y s (6 )a\nily T im e C h a rte r E q u iv a le n t R a te (7 )a\nily O P E X p e r v e s s e l (8 )a\nily O P E X p e r v e s s e l (a s a d ju s te d ) (8 )a\nily N e t C a s h G & A e x p e n s e s p e r v e s s e\nrs ) (3\nl (9 )\n)\nT h ird q u a rte r 2 0 2 4\n1 5 5 .31\n5 4\n1 1 .91\n4 ,2 8 81\n3 ,6 3 68\n7 0$\n1 8 ,8 4 3$\n5 ,2 8 7$\n5 ,1 1 4$\n1 ,2 6 2\nT h ird q u a rte r 2 0 2 3\n1 2 1 .51\n2 0\n1 1 .71\n1 ,1 7 71\n0 ,7 8 52\n0 4$\n1 5 ,0 6 8$\n4 ,9 1 4$\n4 ,8 5 1$\n1 ,0 2 4\nN in e m o n th s e n d e dS\ne p te m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 41\n4 1 .31\n5 4\n1 1 .93\n8 ,7 0 83\n7 ,2 1 01\n,7 9 3$\n1 9 ,2 0 9$\n5 ,2 2 5$\n5 ,1 4 8$\n1 ,2 9 1\nNS\ne\nin e mp\nte m\nob ne th s e n d e dr\n3 0 , 2 0 2 31\n2 5 .11\n2 01\n1 .73\n4 ,1 5 93\n2 ,8 6 76\n3 3$\n1 5 ,0 3 5$\n4 ,8 9 5$\n4 ,7 7 2$\n1 ,0 4 5\nEXHIBIT I: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nWe include EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) herein since it is a basis upon which we\nassess our liquidity position, and we believe that it presents useful information to investors regarding our ability to service\nand/or incur indebtedness.\nTo derive Adjusted EBITDA from EBITDA, we exclude non-cash gains/(losses) such as those related to sale of vessels, share-\nbased compensation expense, impairment loss, loss from bad debt, unrealized gain/(loss) on derivatives and the equity in\nincome/(loss) of investee and other non-cash charges, if any, which may vary from period to period and for different\ncompanies and because these items do not reflect operational cash inflows and outflows of our fleet.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating\nactivities or Net income, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.

Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a\nreconciliation to Voyage Revenues, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe definition of each measure is provided in footnote (7) to the Summary of Selected Data table below.\n(4) Daily OPEX per vessel is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by Ownership days (defined below). Daily OPEX per vessel (as adjusted) is\ncalculated by dividing vessel operating expenses excluding increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic or pre-delivery expenses for each vessel\non acquisition or change of management, if any, by Ownership days. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain\nexpenses (as described above) that were previously excluded.\n(5) Daily Net Cash G&A expenses per vessel is calculated by (1) adding the Management fee expense to the General and Administrative expenses, net of\nshare-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges and (2) then dividing the result by the sum of Ownership days and Charter-in days\n(defined below). Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a reconciliation to General and administrative expenses, which is the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(E x p re s s e d in th o u s a n d s o f U .S . d o lla rs ,\ne x c e p t fo r d a ily ra te s a n d p e r s h a re d a ta )\nV o y a g e R e v e n u e sN\ne t in c o m e\n(1)A d ju s te d N e t in c o m e\nN e t c a s h p ro v id e d b y o p e ra tin g a c tiv itie s(2)E\nB IT D A\n(2)A d ju s te d E B IT D A\nE a rn in g s p e r s h a re b a s icE\na rn in g s p e r s h a re d ilu te d\n(1)A d ju s te d e a rn in g s p e r s h a re b a s ic\n(1)A d ju s te d e a rn in g s p e r s h a re d ilu te d\nD iv id e n d p e r s h a re fo r th e re le v a n t p e rio dA\nv e ra g e N u m b e r o f V e s s e ls(3)T\nC E R e v e n u e s\n(3)D a ily T im e C h a rte r E q u iv a le n t R a te (\"T C E \")\n(4)D a ily O P E X p e r v e s s e l\n(4)D a ily O P E X p e r v e s s e l (a s a d ju s te d )\n(5)D a ily N e t C a s h G & A e x p e n s e s p e r v e s s e l\nS e co n d q u a rte r\n2 0 2 4\n$ 3 5 2 ,8 7 5\n$ 1 0 6 ,0 8 0\n$ 8 9 ,0 5 7\n$ 1 4 2 ,5 9 9\n$ 1 7 1 ,0 4 3\n$ 1 5 3 ,4 6 4\n$ 0 .9 7\n$ 0 .9 3\n$ 0 .8 1\n$ 0 .7 8\n$ 0 .7 0\n1 5 5 .0\n$ 2 6 2 ,1 6 4\n$ 1 9 ,2 6 8\n$ 5 ,3 5 4\n$ 5 ,3 1 9\n$ 1 ,3 7 1\nS e co n d q u a rte r\n2 0 2 3\n$ 2 3 8 ,6 8 6\n$ 4 4 ,3 1 9\n$ 4 8 ,4 9 1\n$ 9 6 ,8 8 0\n$ 9 2 ,5 1 4\n$ 9 6 ,1 8 5\n$ 0 .4 3\n$ 0 .4 3\n$ 0 .4 7\n$ 0 .4 7\n$ 0 .4 0\n1 2 6 .4\n$ 1 7 5 ,5 6 3\n$ 1 5 ,8 3 5\n$ 4 ,9 1 5\n$ 4 ,7 7 2\n$ 1 ,0 5 1\nS ix m o n th s e n d e d\nJu n e 3 0 , 2 0 2 4\n$ 6 1 2 ,2 6 5\n$ 1 8 0 ,9 3 6\n$ 1 6 2 ,2 9 6\n$ 2 5 6 ,8 6 1\n$ 2 9 7 ,3 7 9\n$ 2 7 6 ,4 2 9\n$ 1 .8 7\n$ 1 .8 2\n$ 1 .6 8\n$ 1 .6 4\n$ 1 .4 5\n1 3 4 .2\n$ 4 5 7 ,8 2 8\n$ 1 9 ,4 2 0\n$ 5 ,1 8 8\n$ 5 ,1 6 8\n$ 1 ,3 0 9\nS ix m o n th s e n d e d\nJu n e 3 0 , 2 0 2 3\n$ 4 6 2 ,7 2 1\n$ 9 0 ,1 9 4\n$ 8 5 ,5 6 8\n$ 1 8 0 ,0 7 0\n$ 1 8 6 ,9 0 5\n$ 1 8 0 ,9 8 7\n$ 0 .8 8\n$ 0 .8 7\n$ 0 .8 3\n$ 0 .8 3\n$ 0 .7 5\n1 2 7 .0\n$ 3 3 1 ,6 6 3\n$ 1 5 ,0 2 0\n$ 4 ,8 8 7\n$ 4 ,7 3 4\n$ 1 ,0 5 5\nPetros Pappas, Chief Executive Officer of Star Bulk, commented:\n“During the second quarter 2024, Star Bulk continued having a strong performance generating Net Income of $106.1 million\nwith a TCE per vessel per day of $19,268. This is the first quarter we are reporting as a combined entity after the completion\nof our merger with Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. on April 9th.\nOn August 1st, 2024, Eagle’s outstanding 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes that we guaranteed as part of the Eagle Merger\nmatured, and were converted into shares of Star Bulk common stock. The integration effort is proceeding as planned, and\nwe continue to use our enhanced scale, capabilities and operational leverage to better serve our customers and create value\nfor all stakeholders. Our planned cost and revenue synergy target of $50 million remains unchanged, aiming for the savings\nto be fully realized within 2025.\nAs part of our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, we continue to return capital to shareholders. Our\nBoard of Directors declared a dividend of $0.70 per share, representing the fourteenth consecutive dividend payment. Since\nJune 2021 we will have paid over $1.25 billion in dividends.\nWith total liquidity of over $500 million and net debt of approximately $860 million, we believe we are well positioned to\noperate efficiently and take advantage of attractive opportunities in the dry bulk market. Despite the global geopolitical\nuncertainties, we are constructive about the medium-term prospects of our industry given the favorable order book and\nupcoming rigorous environmental regulations.”\nRecent Developments\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn August 7, 2024, pursuant to our dividend policy, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per\nshare, payable on or about September 6, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of August 27, 2024.\nFleet Update\nVessels’ S&P\nIn connection with the previously announced vessel sales, the vessels Star Dorado, Star Audrey, Star Pyxis, Star Paola,\nCrowned Eagle, Crested Eagle and Stellar Eagle, were delivered to their new owners during the second quarter of 2024. In\naddition, in June and July 2024, we agreed to sell vessels Star Iris and Star Hydrus, which are expected to be delivered to\ntheir new owners by mid-August and October 2024, respectively.\nOverall, in connection with the sales that will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to collect total gross\nproceeds of $29.7 million, and a gain on sale of approximately $7.0 million. We also expect to make debt prepayments of\napproximately $10.6 million in connection with these vessel sales.\nCharter-In Vessels\nIn June 2024, we took delivery of the Star Earendel, a newbuilding Kamsarmax vessel built in JMU, subject to a seven-year\ncharter-in agreement.\nAs of the date of this release on a fully delivered basis and as adjusted for the delivery of a) the vessels agreed to be sold as\ndiscussed above and b) the five firm Kamsarmax vessels currently under construction, we own a fleet of 159 vessels, with\nan aggregate capacity of 15.2 million deadweight ton (“dwt”) consisting of 17 Newcastlemax, 16 Capesize, 1 Mini Capesize,\n7 Post Panamax, 44 Kamsarmax, 1 Panamax, 48 Ultramax and 25 Supramax vessels with carrying capacities between 53,489\ndwt and 209,537 dwt.\nEagle’s 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes Update\nThe Convertible Notes of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (\"Eagle\"), which we guaranteed in\nconnection with the merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Eagle (the “Eagle Merger”) matured on\nAugust 1, 2024 and had a conversion ratio of 86.0801 shares of Star Bulk common stock per $1,000 principal amount of\nConvertible Notes (as adjusted for the dividend that we paid in June 2024). Based on the abovementioned conversion ratio,\nwe issued 5,971,284 new shares of Star Bulk common stock upon maturity of the Convertible Notes, and we subsequently\ncanceled the 1,341,584 shares that were previously issued under the relevant share lending agreement.\nShares Outstanding Update\nAs of the date of this release, we have 118,825,307 shares outstanding.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe previously entered into a number of interest rate swaps and have an outstanding total notional amount of $118.9 million\nunder our financing agreements with an average fixed rate of 62 bps and an average remaining maturity of 1.2 years. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the Mark-to-Market value of our outstanding interest rate swaps stood at $6.4 million, which are all\ndesignated as and qualify for hedge accounting and our cumulative net realized gain amounted to $35.4 million.\nVessel Employment Overview\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate (“TCE rate”) is a non-GAAP measure. Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a\nreconciliation to Voyage Revenues, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOur TCE rate per day per main vessel category was as follows:\nCP\nU\na p e so\ns t P\nltra m\nize / N ea\nn a m a\na x / S u\nw c a sx\n/ K a\np ra m\ntle mm\ns a\na x V\na x V e s srm\na x / P\ne s s e ls :\nea lsn :a\nm a x V e s s e ls :\nS\n$\n$\n$\ne c o n d q\n2\n1\n1\nu\n96\n6\na rte r\n2 0 2 4\n,4 3 9\n,4 8 7\n,0 4 3\n$\n$\n$\nS ix m\ne n d e d Ju\n2\n1\n1\no n th s\nn e 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 4\n8 ,3 7 7\n5 ,8 0 1\n6 ,4 9 6\nAmounts shown throughout the press release and variations in period–over–period comparisons are derived from the actual\nunaudited numbers in our books and records. Reference to per share figures below are based on 115,256,711 and\n102,961,179 weighted average diluted shares for the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSecond Quarter 2024 and 2023 Results\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we had a net income of $106.1 million, or $0.93 earnings per share, compared to a net\nincome for the second quarter of 2023 of $44.3 million, or $0.43 earnings per share. Adjusted net income, which excludes\ncertain non-cash items, was $89.1 million, or $0.78 earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to an\nadjusted net income of $48.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, or $0.47 earnings per share.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was $142.6 million, compared to $96.9 million for\nthe second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain non-cash items, was $153.5 million for the second\nquarter of 2024, compared to $96.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\nVoyage revenues for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $352.9 million from $238.7 million in the second quarter of\n2023 and Time charter equivalent revenues (“TCE Revenues”)1 increased to $262.2 million for the second quarter of 2024,\ncompared to $175.6 million for the second quarter of 2023, mainly driven by the increase in the average number in our fleet\nto 155.0 from 126.4, during the relevant periods and the improved charter rates. TCE rate for the second quarter of 2024\nwas $19,268 compared to $15,835 for the second quarter of 2023 which is indicative of the stronger market conditions\nprevailing during the recent quarter.\nCharter-in hire expenses for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $13.1 million from $3.1 million in the second quarter\nof 2023. This increase is mainly attributable to the increase in charter-in days to 651 in the second quarter of 2024 from 182\nin the corresponding period in 2023.\nVessel operating expenses for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 amounted to $75.5 million and $56.5 million,\nrespectively. The increase in our operating expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Eagle fleet which resulted\nin an increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet to 155.0 from 126.4. Additionally, the increase in daily figures\nfor the second quarter of 2024 was related to the Eagle legacy daily operating expenses of $6,152, compared to daily\noperating expenses excluding pre-delivery expenses of $4,967 for the fleet existing prior to the Eagle Merger. It is expected\nthat the daily operating expenses of the Eagle legacy fleet will be reduced within the following six quarters as a result of the\nsynergies and economies of scale from the Eagle Merger.\nDrydocking expenses for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $12.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024 ten vessels completed their periodic dry docking surveys, compared to eleven vessels which\ncompleted their dry docking during the second quarter of 2023. However, there were also five vessels that commenced their\ndry docking surveys in the second quarter of 2024 compared to one vessel which commenced its dry docking survey during\nthe corresponding period in 2023, resulting in an overall increase in drydocking expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $19.5 million and $11.0 million,\nrespectively, which included the share-based compensation of $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.9 million\nin the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the general and administrative expenses was mainly driven by the increased\nlegacy Eagle costs. We expect that the overall general and administrative expenses will be reduced during the following six\nquarters as a result of the synergies and economies of scale from the Eagle Merger. Vessel management fees for the second\nquarter of 2024 and 2023 were $4.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nDepreciation expense increased to $43.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $35.0 million for the\ncorresponding period in 2023. The fluctuation is primarily driven by the increase in the average number of vessels in our\nfleet to 155.0 from 126.4.\nOur results for the second quarter of 2023 included a loss on write-down of inventories of $2.6 million resulting from the\nvaluation of the bunkers remaining on board our vessels as a result of their lower net realizable value compared to their\nhistorical cost. No such loss was incurred in the second quarter of 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we incurred a net gain on forward freight agreements (“FFAs”) and bunker swaps of $1.6\nmillion, consisting of an unrealized gain of $6.9 million and a realized loss of $5.3 million. During the second quarter of 2023,\nwe incurred a gain on FFAs and bunker swaps of $2.9 million, consisting of an unrealized gain of $1.8 million and a realized\ngain of $1.1 million.\n1 Please see the table at the end of this release for the calculation of the TCE Revenues.\nOur results for the second quarter of 2024 include an aggregate net gain of $14.2 million which resulted from the completion\nof the previously announced sales of vessels as described under the section “Fleet Update” above.\nInterest and finance costs for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $25.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. The\ndriving factor for this increase is the significant increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the new debt obtained\nin order to refinance the existing debt of the Eagle vessels, further affected by the increase in variable interest rates\nprevailing during the corresponding periods.\nUnaudited Consolidated Income Statements\n(E x p re sse d in th o u sa n d s o f U .S . d o

number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our owned fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of\ndays each operating vessel was a part of our owned fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\n(2) As of the last day of each period presented.\n(3) Average age of our operational fleet is calculated as of the end of each period.\n(4) Ownership days are the total calendar days each vessel in the fleet was owned by us for the relevant period, including vessels subject to sale and leaseback\ntransactions and finance leases.\n(5) Available days are the Ownership days after subtracting off-hire days for major repairs, dry docking or special or intermediate surveys, change of\nmanagement and vessels’ improvements and upgrades. The available days for the second quarter of 2023 and six-month period ended June 30, 2023, were\nalso decreased by off-hire days relating to disruptions in connection with crew changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our method of computing\nAvailable Days may not necessarily be comparable to Available Days of other companies.\n(6) Charter-in days are the total days that we charter-in third party vessels.\n(7) Time charter equivalent rate represents the weighted average daily TCE rates of our operating fleet (including owned fleet and charter-in vessels). TCE\nrate is a measure of the average daily net revenue performance of our operating fleet. Our method of calculating TCE rate is determined by dividing (a) TCE\nRevenues, which consists of Voyage Revenues net of voyage expenses, charter-in hire expense, amortization of fair value of above/below market acquired\ntime charter agreements, if any, as well as adjusted for the impact of realized gain/(loss) on forward freight agreements (“FFAs”) and bunker swaps by (b)\nAvailable days for the relevant time period. Available days do not include the Charter-in days as per the relevant definitions provided above. Voyage expenses\nprimarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter\ncontract, as well as commissions. In the calculation of TCE Revenues, we also include the realized gain/(loss) on FFAs and bunker swaps as we believe that\nthis method better reflects the chartering result of our fleet and is more comparable to the method used by some of our peers. TCE Revenues and TCE rate,\nwhich are non-GAAP measures, provide additional meaningful information in conjunction with Voyage Revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure, because they assist our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and because we believe that they\nprovide useful information to investors regarding our financial performance. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily\nto compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., voyage charters, time charters,\nbareboat charters and pool arrangements) under which its vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of computing TCE Revenues and TCE\nrate may not necessarily be comparable to those of other companies. For a detailed calculation please see Exhibit I at the end of this release with the\nreconciliation of Voyage Revenues to TCE.\n(8) Daily OPEX per vessel is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by Ownership days. Daily OPEX per vessel (as adjusted) is calculated by dividing\nvessel operating expenses excluding increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic or pre-delivery expenses for each vessel on acquisition or change of\nmanagement, if any, by Ownership days. We exclude the abovementioned expenses that may occur occasionally from our Daily OPEX per vessel, since these\ngenerally represent items that we would not anticipate occurring as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that Daily OPEX per vessel\n(as adjusted) is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect to our operating cost performance since\nsuch measure eliminates the effects of the items described above, which may vary from period to period, are not part of our daily business and derive from\nreasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain expenses (as described\nabove) that were previously excluded. Vessel operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 and six month period ended June 30, 2023 included\nadditional crew expenses related to the increased number and cost of crew changes performed during the period as a result of COVID-19 restrictions imposed\nin 2020 estimated to be $0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In addition, vessel operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023, included pre-\ndelivery expenses due to change of management of $1.0 million, compared to $0.5 million of pre-delivery expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2024\ndue to change of management and acquisition of the Eagle fleet.\n(9) Please see Exhibit I at the end of this release for the reconciliation to General and administrative expenses, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nWe believe that Daily Net Cash G&A expenses per vessel is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect\nto our financial performance since such measure eliminates the effects of non-cash items which may vary from period to period, are not part of our daily\nbusiness and derive from reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain\nexpenses (as described above) that were previously excluded.\nANAOACDDDD v e ra g e n u m b e r o f v e s s e ls (1 )u\nm b e r o f v e s s e ls (2 )v\ne ra g e a g e o f o p e ra tio n a l fle e t (in y e aw\nn e rs h ip d a y s (4 )v\na ila b le d a y s (5 )h\na rte r-in d a y s (6 )a\nily T im e C h a rte r E q u iv a le n t R a te (7 )a\nily O P E X p e r v e s s e l (8 )a\nily O P E X p e r v e s s e l (a s a d ju s te d ) (8 )a\nily N e t C a s h G & A e x p e n s e s p e r v e s s e\nrs ) (3\nl (9 )\n)\nS e co n d q u a rte r 2 0 2 4\n1 5 5 .01\n5 6\n1 1 .71\n4 ,1 0 61\n3 ,6 0 66\n5 1$\n1 9 ,2 6 8$\n5 ,3 5 4$\n5 ,3 1 9$\n1 ,3 7 1\nS e co n d q u a rte r 2 0 2 3\n1 2 6 .41\n2 6\n1 1 .41\n1 ,4 9 91\n1 ,0 8 71\n8 2$\n1 5 ,8 3 5$\n4 ,9 1 5$\n4 ,7 7 2$\n1 ,0 5 1\nS ix m o n th s e n d e dJu\nn e 3 0 , 2 0 2 41\n3 4 .21\n5 6\n1 1 .72\n4 ,4 2 02\n3 ,5 7 59\n2 2$\n1 9 ,4 2 0$\n5 ,1 8 8$\n5 ,1 6 8$\n1 ,3 0 9\nS ix m o n th s e n d e dJu\nn e 3 0 , 2 0 2 31\n2 7 .01\n2 61\n1 .42\n2 ,9 8 22\n2 ,0 8 24\n2 9$\n1 5 ,0 2 0$\n4 ,8 8 7$\n4 ,7 3 4$\n1 ,0 5 5\nEXHIBIT I: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nWe include EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) herein since it is a basis upon which we\nassess our liquidity position. It is also used by our lenders as a measure of our compliance with certain loan covenants, and\nwe believe that it presents useful information to investors regarding our ability to service and/or incur indebtedness.\nTo derive Adjusted EBITDA from EBITDA, we exclude non-cash gains/(losses) such as those related to sale of vessels, share\nbased compensation expense, impairment loss, loss from bad debt, unrealized gain/(loss) on derivatives and the equity in\nincome/(loss) of investee and other non-cash charges, if any, which may vary from period to period and for different\ncompanies and because these items do not reflect operational cash inflows and outflows of our fleet.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating\nactivities or net income, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Our method\nof computing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not necessarily be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other\ncompanies.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n(E x p re sse d in th o u sa n d s o f U .S . d o lla rs)\nN e t c a s h p ro v id e d b y /(u s e d in ) o p e ra tin g a c tiv itie s\nN e t d e c re a s e /(in c re a s e ) in o p e ra tin g a s s e ts\nN e t in c re a s e /(d e c re a s e ) in o p e ra tin g lia b ilitie s , e x c lu d in g\no p e ra tin g le a s e lia b ility a n d in c lu d in g o th e r n o n -c a s h c h a rg e s\nIm p a irm e n t lo s s\nG a in /(L o s s ) o n d e b t e x tin g u is h m e n t, n e t\nS h a re – b a s e d c o m p e n s a tio n\nA m o rtiza tio n o f d e b t (lo a n s & le a s e s ) is s u a n c e c o s ts\nU n re a lize d g a in /(lo s s ) o n fo rw a rd fre ig h t a g re e m e n ts a n d b u n ks\nw a p s , n e t\nU n re a lize d g a in /(lo s s ) o n in te re s t ra te s w a p s , n e t\nT o ta l o th e r e x p e n s e s , n e t\nG a in fro m in s u ra n c e p ro c e e d s re la tin g to v e s s e l to ta l lo s s\nL o s s o n b a d d e b t\nIn c o m e ta x e x p e n s e /(re fu n d )\nG a in o n s a le o f v e s s e ls\nG a in fro m H u ll & M a c h in e ry c la im\nL o s s o n w rite -d o w n o f in v e n to ry\nE q u ity in in c o m e /(lo s s ) o f in v e s te e\nE B IT D A\nE q u ity in (in c o m e )/lo s s o f in v e s te e\nU n re a lize d (g a in )/lo s s o n fo rw a rd fre ig h t a g re e m e n ts a n d b u n ks\nw a p s , n e t\nG a in o n s a le o f v e s s e ls\nL o s s o n w rite -d o w n o f in v e n to ry\nG a in fro m in s u ra n c e p ro c e e d s re la tin g to v e s s e l to ta l lo s s\nS h a re -b a s e d c o m p e n s a tio n\nL o s s o n b a d d e b t\nIm p a irm e n t lo s s\nO th e r n o n -c a s h c h a rg e s\nA d ju ste d E B IT D A\ne\ne\nr\nr\nS e c o n d q u a rte r\n2 0 2 4\n$ 1 4 2 ,5 9 9\n(1 8 ,1 4 1 )\n9 ,0 9 4\n-\n(1 9 7 )\n(3 ,5 5 6 )\n(9 1 2 )\n6 ,9 1 5\n(3 8 1 )\n2 1 ,4 2 6\n-\n-\n(1 0 )\n1 4 ,1 6 9\n-\n-\n3 7\n$ 1 7 1 ,0 4 3\n(3 7 )\n(6 ,9 1 5 )\n(1 4 ,1 6 9 )\n-\n-\n3 ,5 5 6\n-\n-\n(1 4 )\n$ 1 5 3 ,4 6 4\nS e c o n d q u a rte r\n2 0 2 3\n$ 9 6 ,8 8 0\n(5 ,3 6 5 )\n(7 ,2 0 2 )\n-\n(4 6 9 )\n(2 ,9 1 4 )\n(9 4 7 )\n1 ,7 9 9\n(1 3 5 )\n1 3 ,1 8 9\n-\n-\n-\n(3 4 )\n2 0 0\n(2 ,5 7 7 )\n8 9\n$ 9 2 ,5 1 4\n(8 9 )\n(1 ,7 9 9 )\n3 4\n2 ,5 7 7\n-\n2 ,9 1 4\n-\n-\n3 4\n$ 9 6 ,1 8 5\nS ix m o n th s e n d e d Ju n e\n3 0 , 2 0 2 4\n$ 2 5 6 ,8 6 1\n(1 5 ,7 5 8 )\n(1 ,9 7 5 )\n-\n(1 ,0 1 0 )\n(5 ,7 1 7 )\n(1 ,6 9 1 )\n3 ,7 0 0\n(1 ,3 5 6 )\n4 1 ,0 2 2\n-\n-\n(1 1 6 )\n2 2 ,9 3 8\n4 7 0\n-\n1 1\n$ 2 9 7 ,3 7 9\n(1 1 )\n(3 ,7 0 0 )\n(2 2 ,9 3 8 )\n-\n-\n5 ,7 1 7\n-\n-\n(1 8 )\n$ 2 7 6 ,4 2 9\nS ix m o n th s e n d e d Ju n e\n3 0 , 2 0 2 3\n$ 1 8 0 ,0 7 0\n(9 ,4 0 4 )\n(1 3 ,2 0 6 )\n(7 ,7 0 0 )\n(8 8 8 )\n(6 ,3 6 0 )\n(1 ,9 9 0 )\n(3 ,0 6 5 )\n(5 0 7 )\n2 6 ,5 3 3\n2 8 ,1 6 3\n(3 0 0 )\n1 0 3\n(3 4 )\n2 0 0\n(4 ,7 4 3 )\n3 3\n$ 1 8 6 ,9 0 5\n(3 3 )\n3 ,0 6 5\n3 4\n4 ,7 4 3\n(2 8 ,1 6 3 )\n6 ,3 6 0\n3 0 0\n7 ,7 0 0\n7 6\n$ 1 8 0 ,9 8 7\nNet income and Adjusted Net income Reconciliation and Calculation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nTo derive Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share Basic and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Diluted from Net Income,\nwe exclude non-cash items, as provided in the table below. We believe that Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per\nShare Basic and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Diluted assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability\nof our performance from period to period since each such measure eliminates the effects of such non-cash items, as\ngain/(loss) on sale of assets, unrealized gain/(loss) on derivatives, impairment loss and other items which may vary from\nyear to year, for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In addition, we believe that the presentation of the\nrespective measure provides investors with supplemental data relating to our results of operations, and therefore, with a\nmore complete understanding of factors affecting our business than with GAAP measures alone.

Star Bulk’s vessels transport major\nbulks, which include iron ore, minerals and grain, and minor bulks, which include bauxite, fertilizers and steel products. Star Bulk was incorporated in the\nMarshall Islands on December 13, 2006 and maintains executive offices in Athens, New York, Limassol, Singapore, Germany and Denmark. Its common\nstock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SBLK”.
