Pierluigi Paracchi, as a moderator of the NWTIB, will present the recently released _Interim Report_ (full report in English [HERE](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vrkKgmm6VxBDEjLA0vmRz0uAVvz2LZLAy-z_xX1VaomTsIuNM18WIR2CAsbBTIvc5ljbwcg1dj5Q7UZSZw_gvw0Txm-9imoCujbMYW51bLRLrMo7h-eVKAElJFFzBrwRcG334xIInTnAMCOxODb4Zg==)).\n\n**Keynote Speakers:****Michelle Rozo** _, Vice Chair of the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB)_**Mariangela Zappia** _, Ambassador of Italy to the U.S._**Megan Frisk** _, Ph.D., Director Division of lnternational Affairs at the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H)_**Mauro Battocchi** _, Director General for the Promotion of ltaly at the ltalian Ministry of Foreign Affairs_ **Pierluigi Paracchi** , _CEO and Co-founder of Genenta Science (Nasdaq: GNTA)_ **Patrick Soon-Shiong** , _M.D.,_  _Chairman of Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation, Executive Chairman of ImmunityBio, Executive Chairman of California Times_ **Andrea llly** _, Chair at lllycaffè_\n\n**From the CEO's Desk: Pierluigi Paracchi** stated: “With the pandemic, biotechnologies have been elevated to strategic technologies by leading global nations. Italy, with its rich scientific heritage, must ensure that these innovations are rapidly and concretely applied, while preserving them as national assets. At the same time, the internationalization of the sector, collaboration with partner countries, and the attraction of foreign investments are crucial for ensuring competitive growth. Government investment agencies should focus on strategic operations of a competitive scale, aligning with the international standards of countries already leading the sector.”\n\n![Cross-Border Investments and Strategies in the Biotechnology Sector: A Transatlantic Perspective](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/0eb35962-e4cc-415b-8ed7-30daa2c62281/image1.png)\n\n**About Genenta and Temferon** Genenta ([www.genenta.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6sR16vkzaHmMf-7dw4ouWZSc3-eTY-pEIUtIzCtcv6olAGrwbrSHoO7TE_lNNJoS--EyYOXPGZvrkHD-JkIW8w==)) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of a proprietary hematopoietic stem cell therapy for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor cancers. Temferon™ is based on ex-vivo gene transfer into autologous Tie2+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to deliver immunomodulatory molecules directly via tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (Tie2 Expressing Monocytes - TEMs). Temferon is currently under investigation in a clinical trial for newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme patients with an unmethylated MGMT gene promoter (uMGMT-GBM) and expects to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC). Temferon is designed to reach solid tumors, induce a durable immune response not restricted to pre-selected tumor antigens nor type, and avoid systemic toxicity, which are some of the main unresolved challenges in immuno-oncology.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release contain “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

This approval by AIFA is in line with the standards that are harmonized across European regulatory frameworks established by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**From the CEO's Desk: Pierluigi Paracchi** , CEO and Co-founder of Genenta, stated: “This approval to initiate a Phase 1 trial in metastatic renal cell carcinoma marks another significant milestone for Genenta, leverages the encouraging results from treating Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), and underscores our platform’s potential versatility and effectiveness in other solid tumor indications. We believe Temferon will offer a new experimental treatment to patients with late-stage mRCC, a patient population with no currently available treatment options. The insights gained from our uMGMT Glioblastoma Multiforme (TEM-GBM) studies continue to inform and enhance our understanding, demonstrating Temferon's potential to reprogram the tumor microenvironment and activate the immune system across diverse oncology landscapes.”\n\n**Clinical Progress:** Genenta's ongoing TEM-GBM development program is progressing having completed a Phase 1 dose-ranging trial that confirmed the absence of dose-limiting toxicities across 24 patients. Temferon-derived cells remained detectable in the peripheral blood for over two years post-infusion. The treatment has been associated with a median survival of 16.8 months, showing a 25% increase in the 2 years overall survival, setting the stage for our decision to advance to Phase 2 of the study.\n\nMetastatic disease is evident in 25% of newly diagnosed patients with mRCC. The newly approved mRCC trial, expected to commence in Q4 2024, targets a high-risk patient population whose median overall survival is currently less than 2 years after multiple lines of therapy. IFNα, the therapeutic payload delivered by Temferon, has demonstrated benefits across a range of solid tumors, including those involving the urinary tract. This trial aims to leverage similar immune response mechanisms against renal cell cancer.\n\n**Preclinical Update:** Prof. **Luigi Naldini** , Co-founder of Genenta, noted: “Our recent preclinical studies demonstrate synergy between Temferon and other immunotherapy treatments, specifically in the context of solid tumors. This innovative approach leverages Temferon's ability to reprogram the tumor microenvironment, fostering a cell-mediated immune response. These findings are pivotal as they lay the groundwork for new therapeutic strategies that could significantly improve outcomes for patients with solid tumors.”\n\n**Upcoming Engagements:** Genenta will showcase these developments at several upcoming events, including Maxim Group’s 2024 Healthcare Virtual Summit (October 15-17) and at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting (November 21-24, Houston, Texas).\n\n**About Genenta and Temferon** Genenta ([www.genenta.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NZUzxnMPTsG_jsUD31CvU9kkelWUIEL4jtIIj-dCYBPx-zziMxk0wgSyCO_RFxB_y6ati7s4H7FviwHNvA9_tQ==)) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of a proprietary hematopoietic stem cell therapy for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor cancers.
