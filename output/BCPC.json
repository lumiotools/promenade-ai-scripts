For the quarter, the Company reported net sales of $239.9 million, net earnings of\n$33.8 million, adjusted EBITDA(a) of $64.4 million, and free cash flow(a) of $42.2 million.\nTed Harris, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, “We delivered strong third quarter financials with solid revenue\ngrowth and record earnings from operations and adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see excellent performance in our Human\nNutrition and Health and Specialty Products segments, both delivering strong sales and earnings growth.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:\n• Net sales were $239.9 million, an increase of 4.3% compared to the prior year quarter.\n• Adjusted EBITDA was a record $64.4 million, an increase of 7.6% from the prior year quarter.\n• GAAP net earnings were $33.8 million, an increase of 16.4% from the prior year quarter.\n• GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 compared to $0.90 in the prior year quarter and record adjusted earnings per share(a)\nof $1.13 compared to $1.04 in the prior year quarter.\n• Cash flows from operations were $51.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, with quarterly free cash flow(a) of $42.2\nmillion.\n• Strong sales growth and earnings from operations in both our Human Nutrition and Health and Specialty Products\nsegments.\nRecent Highlights:\n• Balchem’s Human Nutrition and Health segment continued to bring innovative new products to its minerals and\nnutrients portfolio with two new solutions, K2Vital® Delta Fermented and VitaCholine® Pro-Flo.

The increase was primarily driven by higher sales within both the minerals and nutrients\nbusiness and the food and beverage markets. Record earnings from operations for this segment of $35.6 million increased $4.3\nmillion, or 13.8%, compared to $31.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales and a\nfavorable mix, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Excluding the effect of non-cash expense associated with\namortization of acquired intangible assets and other adjustments, adjusted earnings from operations(a) for this segment were $39.0\nmillion, compared to $35.5 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 9.7%.\nThe Animal Nutrition and Health segment generated quarterly sales of $52.9 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 1.9%,\ncompared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by lower sales in the monogastric species markets, partially offset by\nhigher sales in the ruminant species markets. Third quarter earnings from operations for this segment of $3.5 million decreased\n$1.5 million, or 30.4%, compared to $5.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned lower sales and\nhigher operating expenses. Excluding the effect of non-cash expense associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets\nand other adjustments, adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were $4.0 million compared to $5.1 million in the prior\nyear quarter, a decrease of 21.2%.\nThe Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $33.2 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 10.6%, compared\nto the prior year quarter, due to higher sales in both the performance gases business and the plant nutrition business. Earnings\nfrom operations for this segment were $10.5 million, compared to $8.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter, an increase of\n$1.8 million, or 20.3%, primarily driven by the aforementioned higher sales and a favorable mix, partially offset by higher\noperating expenses. Excluding the effect of non-cash expense associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets and other\nadjustments, adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were $11.7 million, compared to $9.8 million in the prior year\nquarter, an increase of 18.9%.\nRecord quarterly consolidated gross margin of $85.4 million increased by $8.8 million, or 11.5%, compared to $76.5 million\nfor the prior year comparable period. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 35.6% as compared to 33.3% in the prior year\nperiod, an increase of 230 basis points, primarily due to a favorable mix. Operating expenses of $37.4 million for the quarter\nincreased $4.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs and transaction\ncosts, partially offset by lower amortization.\nNet interest expense was $4.1 million and $6.6 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in\ninterest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were 22.9% and 20.3%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to lower tax\nbenefits from stock-based compensation and certain higher U.S. state taxes.\nThird quarter cash flows provided by operating activities were $51.3 million and free cash flow was $42.2 million. The\n$216.5 million of net working capital on September 30, 2024 included a cash balance of $73.7 million. Significant cash payments\nduring the quarter included repayments on the revolving loan of $39.6 million, income taxes paid of $12.4 million, and capital\nexpenditures and intangible assets acquired of $9.1 million.\nTed Harris said, “The Balchem team delivered another strong quarter, once again highlighting the resilience of our business\nmodel in what continues to be a challenging market environment. We remain confident in the long-term growth outlook for our\ncompany as we continue to focus on progressing our strategic growth initiatives over the course of the remainder of 2024 and\nbeyond.”\nPage | 3\nBalchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)\nQuarterly Conference Call\nA quarterly conference call will be held on Friday, October 25, 2024, at 11:00 AM Eastern Time (ET) to review third quarter\n2024 results.

The fair\nvalue of inventory reflects the acquired company's cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP\nadjustment to our cost of sales excludes the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting\nprinciples. We believe the adjustment is useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our\nbusiness.\n(2) Amortization of intangible assets and finance lease: Amortization of intangible assets and finance lease consists of amortization of customer\nrelationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technology, regulatory registration costs, patents and trade secrets, capitalized loan\nissuance costs, other intangibles acquired primarily in connection with business combinations, an intangible asset in connection with a\ncompany-wide ERP system implementation, and one finance lease. We record expense relating to the amortization of these intangibles and\nfinance lease in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization expenses for our intangible assets and finance lease are inconsistent in amount\nand are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of an acquisition. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these expenses\nto facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n(3) Restructuring costs: Expenses related to a reorganization of the business. The restructuring costs are included in our GAAP financial\nstatements. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures. We\nbelieve that excluding these items from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they are inconsistent in amounts and\nfrequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n(4) Transaction and integration costs: Transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and divestitures are expensed in our GAAP\nfinancial statements. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. We believe that excluding these items from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because these are items\nassociated with transactions that are inconsistent in amount and frequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be\ndifficult.\n(5) Impairment charge: An asset impairment charge in 2024 was related to the write off of an equity method investment. The impairment charge\nis included in our GAAP financial statements. Management excludes this item for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and other\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe that excluding this item from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it is\ninconsistent in amount and frequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n(6) Nonqualified deferred compensation plan (income) expense: Gains and losses on rabbi trust assets related to our nonqualified deferred\ncompensation plan are recorded in other (income) expense while the offsetting increases or decreases to the deferred compensation liability are\nrecorded within earnings from operations. The increases and decreases in the deferred compensation liability are driven by market volatility\nand are not a true reflection of company performance. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to\ninvestors because these items are inconsistent in amount based on market conditions causing comparison of current and historical financial\nresults to be difficult. Adjustments have been made to the prior period presentation to conform with the current period presentation.\n(7) Income tax adjustment: For purposes of calculating adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision for\n(benefit from) income taxes to tax effect the taxable and deductible non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact\non our income tax (benefit) provision. Additionally, the income tax adjustment is adjusted for the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09,\n“Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” and uses our non-GAAP effective rate applied to both our GAAP earnings\nbefore income tax expense and non-GAAP adjustments described above. See Table 3 for the calculation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate.\n(8) Impact of ASU 2016-09: The primary impact of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" (\"ASU\n2016-09\"), was the recognition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of excess tax benefits as a reduction to\nthe provision for income taxes and the classification of these excess tax benefits in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash\nflows instead of financing activities. Management excludes this item for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Income Tax Expense. We believe\nthat excluding the item in our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it is inconsistent in amount and frequency causing\ncomparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\nPage | 11"

accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),\nthis earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are helpful in understanding and comparing our past\nfinancial performance and our future results. The non-GAAP financial measures in this press release include adjusted gross margin,\nadjusted earnings from operations, adjusted net earnings and the related adjusted per diluted share amounts, EBITDA, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted income tax expense, and free cash flow. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude\ncertain business combination accounting adjustments and certain other items related to acquisitions, certain equity compensation,\nnonqualified deferred compensation plan expense (income), and certain one-time or unusual transactions. Detailed non-GAAP\nadjustments are described in the reconciliation tables below and also explained in the related footnotes. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the\nfinancial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Investors\nshould not consider non-GAAP measures as alternatives to the related GAAP measures.\n30\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nReconciliation of adjusted earnings from operations\nGAAP earnings from operations $47,992 $43,614 $135,465 $120,858\nInventory valuation adjustment (1) — — — 1,419\nAmortization of intangible assets and finance lease (2) 3,854 7,008 15,559 21,310\nRestructuring costs (3) 521 1,913 521 8,179\nTransaction and integration costs (4) 223 -3,116 704 -8,300\nImpairment charge (5) 255 — 255 —\nNonqualified deferred compensation plan expense (6) 406 -86 922 395\nAdjusted earnings from operations $53,251 $49,333 $153,426 $143,861\nReconciliation of adjusted net earnings\nGAAP net earnings $33,837 $29,075 $94,892 $81,895\nInventory valuation adjustment (1) — — — 1,419\nAmortization of intangible assets and finance lease (2) 3,926 7,080 15,775 21,526\nRestructuring costs (3) 521 1,913 521 8,179\nTransaction and integration costs (4) 223 -3,116 704 -8,300\nImpairment charge (5) 255 — 255 —\nIncome tax adjustment (7) -1,834 -1,157 -6,058 -5,902\nAdjusted net earnings $36,928 $33,795 $106,089 $98,817\nAdjusted net earnings per common share - diluted $1.13 $1.04 $3.25 $3.05\n31\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Earnings to EBITDA and to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Dollars in thousands; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet earnings - as reported $33,837 $29,075 $94,892 $81,895\nAdd back:\nProvision for income taxes 10,056 7,400 27,077 22,099\nInterest and other expenses 4,099 7,139 13,496 16,864\nDepreciation and amortization 10,831 13,733 36,861 40,663\nEBITDA 58,823 57,347 172,326 161,521\nAdd back:\nNon-cash compensation expense related to equity awards 4,151 3,749 12,787 12,267\nInventory valuation adjustment (1) — — — 1,419\nRestructuring costs (3) 521 1,913 521 8,179\nTransaction and integration costs (4) 223 -3,116 704 -8,300\nImpairment charge (5) 255 — 255 —\nNonqualified deferred compensation plan expense (6) 406 -86 922 395\nAdjusted EBITDA $64,379 $59,807 $187,515 $175,481\n32\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n33\nG\nIm\nA\nG\nIm\nA\nA A\np a\nd ju\nA A\np a\nd ju\nR e c o n c ilia\nP In c o m e T a x\nc t o f A S U 2 0 1\ns te d In c o m e T\nP In c o m e T a x\nc t o f A S U 2 0 1\ns te d In c o m e T\nt io n o f G\nE x p e n s e\n(8) 6 - 0 9\na x E x p e n\nE x p e n s e\n(8) 6 - 0 9\na x E x p e n\nA\ns e\ns e\nA P E f f e c t iv\n(D\ne\no\nI n\nlla\nc\nr\no\ns\nm e T\nin th\na\no\nx\nu\nR\ns a\na\nn\nt\nd\ne t o N\ns ; u n a\n2 0 2 4\n$ 1 0 ,0\n6\n$ 1 0 ,6\n2 0 2 4\n$ 2 7 ,0\n1 ,9\n$ 2 9 ,0\no n\nu d\nT\n5 6\n2 5\n8 1\nN\n7 7\n5 2\n2 9\n- G A A\nite d )\nh r e e M\nET\nin e M\nET\nP E f f e c\no n t h s E\nf f e c t iv ea\nx R a t e\n2 2 .9 0 %\n2 4 .3 0 %\no n t h s E\nf f e c t iv ea\nx R a t e\n2 2 .2 0 %\n2 3 .8 0 %\nt iv e I n c o m e T a x R a t e\nn d e d S e p t e m b e r 3 0 ,\nE f2\n0 2 3\nT a\n$ 7 ,4 0 0\n1 9\n$ 7 ,4 1 9\nn d e d S e p t e m b e r 3 0 ,\nE f2\n0 2 3\nT a\n$ 2 2 ,0 9 9\n8 6 3\n$ 2 2 ,9 6 2\nf e c t iv ex\nR a t e\n2 0 .3 0 %\n2 0 .3 0 %\nf e c t iv ex\nR a t e\n2 1 .3 0 %\n2 2 .1 0 %\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\n(Dollars in thousands; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $51,302 $46,526 $129,682 $116,355\nCapital expenditures, proceeds from the sale of assets,\n-9,065 -8,320 -22,240 -21,212\nand settlement of net investment hedge\nFree cash flow $42,237 $38,206 $107,442 $95,143\nNon-GAAP Financial Information - Continued\n(1) Inventory valuation adjustment: Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company's cost of manufacturing plus a\nportion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustment to our cost of sales excludes the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles. We believe the\nadjustment is useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business.\n(2) Amortization of intangible assets and finance lease: Amortization of intangible assets and finance lease consists of amortization of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technology, regulatory\nregistration costs, patents and trade secrets, capitalized loan issuance costs, other intangibles acquired primarily in connection with business combinations, an intangible asset in connection with a company-wide ERP system\nimplementation, and one finance lease. We record expense relating to the amortization of these intangibles and finance lease in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization expenses for our intangible assets and finance\nlease are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of an acquisition. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these expenses to facilitate an evaluation of our current\noperating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n(3) Restructuring costs: Expenses related to a reorganization of the business. The restructuring costs are included in our GAAP financial statements. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating Adjusted\nEBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that excluding these items from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they are inconsistent in amounts and frequency causing\ncomparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n(4) Transaction and integration costs: Transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and divestitures are expensed in our GAAP financial statements. Management excludes these items for the purposes of\ncalculating Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that excluding these items from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because these are items associated with\ntransactions that are inconsistent in amount and frequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n(5) Impairment charge: An asset impairment charge in 2024 was related to the write off of an equity method investment. The impairment charge is included in our GAAP financial statements. Management excludes this item\nfor the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that excluding this item from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it is inconsistent in\namount and frequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n(6) Nonqualified deferred compensation plan (income) expense: Gains and losses on rabbi trust assets related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan are recorded in other (income) expense while the offsetting\nincreases or decreases to the deferred compensation liability are recorded within earnings from operations. The increases and decreases in the deferred compensation liability are driven by market volatility and are not a true\nreflection of company performance. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because these items are inconsistent in amount based on market conditions causing\ncomparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult. Adjustments have been made to the prior period presentation to conform with the current period presentation.\n(7) Income tax adjustment: For purposes of calculating adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision for (benefit from) income taxes to tax effect the taxable and deductible non-\nGAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax (benefit) provision. Additionally, the income tax adjustment is adjusted for the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to\nEmployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” and uses our non-GAAP effective rate applied to both our GAAP earnings before income tax expense and non-GAAP adjustments described above. See Table 3 for the\ncalculation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate.\n(8) Impact of ASU 2016-09: The primary impact of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" (\"ASU 2016-09\"), was the recognition during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, of excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes and the classification of these excess tax benefits in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows\ninstead of financing activities. Management excludes this item for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Income Tax Expense. We believe that excluding the item in our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors\nbecause it is inconsistent in amount and frequency causing comparison of current and historical financial results to be difficult.\n34\nThank you\n35"
