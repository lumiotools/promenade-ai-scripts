(Bioceres) (NASDAQ:\nBIOX), a leader in the development and commercialization of productivity solutions designed to\nregenerate agricultural ecosystems while making crops more resilient to climate change, announced\nfinancial results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024. Financial results are expressed in\nU.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. All\ncomparisons in this announcement are year-over-year (YoY), unless otherwise noted.\nFinancial & Business Highlights\n● Total revenues in 1Q25 were $93.3 million, compared to $116.6 million in the same quarter last\nyear. Results were driven by performance in Argentina, where the summer crop season began at\nan unusually slow pace due to delayed rains and just-in-time purchasing behavior. North America\nand Brazil gained momentum, despite lingering market headwinds, and partially offset the soft\nperformance in Argentina.\n● Operating profit1 was $3.4 million and net loss1 was $5.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA1 for the\nquarter was $8.5 million.\n● RinoTec technology received EPA’s Green Chemistry Challenge Award in the Design of Safer\nand Degradable Chemicals category.\n● Regulatory approvals for HB4 soybean production were obtained in Uruguay and Bolivia,\nmarking full clearance for the technology across all soybean producing countries in the\nAmericas.\nManagement Review\nMr. Federico Trucco, Bioceres´ Chief Executive Officer, commented: “As farmers understand better than\nanyone else, agriculture is inherently dependent on weather. While, as a technology company we are\ndedicated to helping farmers navigate this reality, our business cycle also faces weather-related impacts.\nTo mitigate these effects, we rely on portfolio diversification across product types, usage timing, and\nmultiple crops. However, much like in farming itself, geographic diversification remains the most effective\nhedge against weather events.\n1 Please refer to “Use of non-IFRS financial information” for information regarding net loss, operating profit and our use of Adjusted EBITDA and its\nreconciliation from the most comparable financial measure.\n2 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nThis quarter, we saw the benefits of this strategy, with positive contributions from Brazil, the United Sates,\nand our Syngenta collaboration outside of Argentina. Together, these almost doubled their share of total\nsales and, even more importantly, expanded their contribution to total gross profit by 2.5 times. This\npositive international performance, coupled with fully normalized rainfall in Argentina, allows us to remain\noptimistic for the rest of the fiscal year.\nThat said, we remain focused on cost management and a disciplined approach to capital allocation,\naiming to both adapt to and increase our flexibility amid current market conditions. At the same time, our\ncommitment to advancing our unique portfolio of technologies is unaltered, encouraged by the\nrecognition and validation our technologies continue to receive from regulators worldwide, as highlighted\nin this quarter’s report.”\nMr. Enrique Lopez Lecube, Bioceres´ Chief Financial Officer, noted: \"Results for the quarter were marked\nby a slower-than-usual start to the high season and tough market conditions in Argentina, partially offset\nby strong performance in North America and Brazil. This highlights the importance of our evolving\nstrategy of geographic and portfolio diversification. Moving forward, capital allocation will continue to\nprioritize products and technologies with lower-risk and near-term payback periods. Coupled with a more\ndisciplined approach to working capital management, this aims to enhance cash generation for the fiscal\nyear, while preserving the long-term intrinsic value of our unique portfolio of current and future\ntechnologies”.\nKey Financial Metrics\nTable 1:\n1Q25 Key Financial Metrics\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 1Q24 1Q25 %CHANGE\nRevenue by Segment\nCrop Protection 55.9 47.7 (15%)\nSeed and Integrated Products 22.3 19.8 (11%)\nCrop Nutrition 38.3 25.7 (33%)\nTotal Revenue 116.6 93.3 (20%)\nGross Profit 45.0 37.5 (17%)\nGross Margin 38.6% 40.2% 161 bps\n1Q24 1Q25 %CHANGE\nNet income or loss 1 (2.7) (5.3) (96%)\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 16.3 8.5 (48%)\n1Q25 Summary: Revenues for the quarter totaled $93.3 million, compared to $116.6 million in the same\nperiod last year. The beginning of summer crop planting in Latin America was marked by unfavorable\nmarket conditions in Argentina, where a slow start to the season, driven primarily by weather, affected\nsales of crop protection products and primarily drove results for the country. Sales of micro-beaded\n3 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nfertilizers in Argentina remained under pressure due to an unusual shift of corn acreage into soybeans.\nImportantly, key markets such as North America and Brazil posted growth, despite lingering headwinds.\nGross profit for the quarter was $37.5 million, reflecting a 17% decline, consistent with the decline in\nsales. However, overall gross margin improved driven by a strategic focus on products with higher\nmargins and more favorable cash conversion cycles, in line with the Company’s strengthened emphasis\non cash generation and working capital management. This shift led to a reduced focus on third-party\nproducts sales, which faced heightened competition and price pressure in Argentina’s crop protection\nindustry. Operating profit1 for the quarter was $3.4 million, with a net loss1 of $5.3 million. Adjusted\nEBITDA1 for the quarter was $8.5 million.\nFiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nRevenues\nTable 2:\n1Q25 Revenues by Segment\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 1Q24 1Q25 %CHANGE\nRevenue by Segment\nCrop Protection 55.9 47.7 (15%)\nSeed and Integrated Products 22.3 19.8 (11%)\nCrop Nutrition 38.3 25.7 (33%)\nTotal Revenue 116.6 93.3 (20%)\nRevenues in 1Q25 were $93.3 million, compared to $116.6 million in 1Q24. Top-line performance was\ndriven by results from Argentina, where a slow start of the summer crop planting season due to delayed\nrains and challenging market conditions resulted in lower quarterly revenues compared to the prior year.\nOther regions such as the United States, Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay have gained momentum with year-\nover-year revenue growth, despite lingering market headwinds.\nCrop Nutrition saw the largest year-over-year decline this quarter, with revenues from the segment at\n$25.7 million compared to $38.3 million in the same quarter last year. The decline is mostly explained by\nmicro-beaded fertilizers, whose demand was negatively affected by expectations of a ~20% reduction in\ncorn acreage this year in Argentina. Last year’s corn production was majorly affected by a pest known\nlocally as “Chicharrita” or corn leafhopper, and concerns of a repeat occurrence led many farmers to\nforgo this crop altogether substituting for soybeans - a crop that demands far lower fertilization.\nCrop Protection sales were $47.7 million, compared to $55.9 million during the same quarter last year.\nThe decrease results from lower product use in Argentina, as demand has been thwarted by dry weather,\nwhich resulted in delayed plantings and lower pest presence. Additionally, well-supplied distribution\nchannels for certain non-core third-party products led to price-driven market dynamics and prompted a\nshift away from sales with less attractive margins and cash conversion profiles. A normalization of\nrainfall, seen particularly in the last month, opens the possibility of having a normal or even good crop\nseason going forward. Outside of Argentina, the business continued to expand, with solid growth in sales\nof bioprotection seed treatment products in the United States, higher sales of adjuvants and other seed\nprotection products in Brazil and continued commercial expansion in Mexico with bioprotection\nproducts.\n4 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nSeed & Integrated Product sales were $19.8 million, compared to $22.3 million for the same quarter last\nyear, with the decline mostly explained by lower HB4 downstream sales. Downstream sales commenced\nlast year as a strategy to minimize working capital by selling off grain inventories and to develop an\nindustrial channel for HB4 grain. While these sales are expected to continue throughout this fiscal year,\nthey will progressively decline year-over-year, as the business model used for the roll-out of HB4 wheat\nevolves into a more conventional one, in line with the Company’s strategic intent of prioritizing cash\ngeneration.\nGross Profit & Margin\nTable 3:\n1Q25 Gross Profit by Segment\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 1Q24 1Q25 %CHANGE\nGross profit by Segment\nCrop Protection 19.7 18.7 (5%)\nSeed and Integrated Products 8.2 7.1 (14%)\nCrop Nutrition 17.0 11.7 (31%)\nTotal Gross Profit 45.0 37.5 (17%)\n%Gross Margin 38.6% 40.2% 161 bps\nGross profit for the quarter was $37.5 million, compared to $45.0 million the year before, with a year-over-\nyear decline of 17%, in line with that of sales.\nIn Crop Nutrition, gross profit decreased by 31% compared to the same quarter last year, driven mostly\nby the decrease in fertilizer sales. Segment gross margin improved slightly, due to a greater contribution\nfrom high-margin inoculants to the product mix. Additionally, the gross margin for inoculants increased,\ndriven by the acceleration of the profit-sharing agreement with Syngenta, offsetting the slightly lower\nmargins on micro-beaded fertilizer sales.\nIn Seed and Integrated Products, gross profit declined by 14% in line with performance in sales, and\nmargin compression in seed treatment packs, particularly in Argentina.\nFinally, in the Crop Protection segment the 15% drop in revenues was significantly neutralized by gross\nmargin expansion, which led to a 5% decrease in gross profit compared to the same quarter last year.\nImproved gross margin performance was driven by an increased focus on working capital management,\nas growth in high-margin proprietary bioprotection products offset forgone sales of non-core third-party\nproducts facing pricing pressures in the Argentine market.\nGiven the changes in product mix in Crop Nutrition and Crop Protection, the overall gross margin was\nhigher, compared to the year before, at 40.2%.\n5 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: SG&A expenses excluding D&A and share-based\nincentives, were $26.7 million in 1Q25 compared to $25.7 million in the same quarter last year. Despite\ninflationary pressure on fixed costs, SG&A expenses remained largely stable, supported by increased\nscrutiny on capital allocation efficiency and sustained cost management efforts implemented across\nmultiple regions over recent quarters. The increase in SG&A is fully explained by a transitory effect of\nimport taxes on raw materials in Argentina.\nResearch and Development: total R&D expenses excluding D&A and share-based incentives were $2.8\nmillion in 1Q25, a slight decrease compared to $3.1 million in 1Q24. R&D expenses represented 3% of\nsales in both quarters.\nNet Income & Adjusted EBITDA1\nNet loss1 was $5.3 million in 1Q25, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million for the same quarter last year.\nThe change was mainly due to lower operating profit -- largely driven by the situation in Argentina, as\npreviously discussed-- and higher financial expenses. The decline was partially offset by income tax\nbenefits, compared to the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA1 totaled $8.5 million in 1Q25, compared to $16.3 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe decline in Adjusted EBITDA1 was substantially driven by the reduction in gross profit contribution\nfrom Crop Nutrition and a decrease in JV results, both adversely affected by lower sales of micro-beaded\nfertilizers on the slower planting pace and a shift away from corn acreage in Argentina. Adverse crop\nprotection market conditions in Argentina were partially offset by improved gross margin performance,\nsupported by portfolio and geographic diversification. Tighter cost control and disciplined capital\nallocation kept operating expenses practically stable, despite inflationary pressures.\nFinancial Income and Loss\nTable 4:\n1Q25 Net Financial Result\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 1Q24 1Q25 %CHANGE\nInterest expenses (3.3) (5.1) (54%)\nFinancial commissions (0.6) (1.1) (75%)\nChanges in fair value, FX and\n(3.6) (3.6) (1%)\nother financial results\nTotal Financial Result (7.5) (9.8) (30%)\nInterest expenses rose by $1.8 million during the quarter, reaching $5.1 million in 1Q25. This increase\nwas driven by a higher total debt position and an uneven comparison to 1Q24, when expenses benefited\nfrom an FX hedge in Argentina. Financial commissions increased by $0.5 million, mainly explained by\nincreased use of credit card payments from distributors. A one-time increase in changes in fair value was\noffset by a decline in FX results as currency in Argentina remained substantially stable in 1Q25 compared\nto the prior year.\n6 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nTable 5: Capitalization and Debt\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) As of September, 30\n2023 2024\nTotal Debt\nShort-Term Debt 100.7 121.5\nLong-Term Debt 125.7 128.7\nCash and Cash Equivalents (28.4) (32.3)\nOther short-term investments (14.6) (5.9)\nDebt net of cash, cash equivalents and other short-\n183.4 212.0\nterm investments\nFiscal First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call and question-and-answer session, which will be accompanied\nby a presentation available during the webcast or accessed via the investor relations section of the\ncompany’s website.\nTo access the call, please use the following information:\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024\nPlease dial in 5-10 minutes prior to the start time to\nregister and join.

The\nnon-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance\nprepared in accordance with IFRS and may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other\ncompanies. In addition, the non-IFRS measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting\nrules or principles. Non-IFRS measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts\nassociated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.\nThis non-IFRS financial measures should only be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations\nin conjunction with the most comparable IFRS financial measures. In addition, other companies may\nreport similarly titled measures, but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a\ncomparative measure. Management utilizes these non-IFRS metrics as performance measures in\nevaluating and making operational decisions regarding our business.\n8 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss) exclusive of financial income/(costs),\nincome tax benefit/(expense), depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and one-time\ntransactional expenses.\nManagement believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors about\nthe company and its results. Adjusted EBITDA is among the measures used by the management team\nto evaluate the company’s financial and operating performance and make day-to-day financial and\noperating decisions. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and similarly titled measures are frequently used by\ncompetitors, rating agencies, securities analysts, investors and other parties to evaluate companies in\nthe same industry. Management also believes that adjusted EBITDA is helpful to investors because it\nprovides additional information about trends in the company’s core operating performance prior to\nconsidering the impact of capital structure, depreciation, amortization and taxation on results. Adjusted\nEBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial\nperformance reported in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool,\nincluding:\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, including cash requirements for working capital needs or\ncontractual commitments.\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect financial expenses, or the cash requirements to service interest or\nprincipal payments on indebtedness, or interest income or other financial income.\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay income taxes.\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or\namortized often will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash\nrequirements for these replacements.\n• Although share-based compensation is a non-cash charge, adjusted EBITDA does not consider the\npotentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; and\n• Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA and similarly titled measures differently, limiting its\nusefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe company compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA through\ndisclosure of these limitations, presentation in the combined financial statements in accordance with\nIFRS and reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure,\nincome/(loss) for the period or year.\nTable 6:\n1Q25 Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation from Profit/(Loss) for the period\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 1Q24 1Q25\nProfit/(Loss) for the period (2.7) (5.3)\nOther income/loss - (1.0)\nIncome tax 0.4 (1.2)\nFinancial results 7.5 9.8\nDepreciations & amortizations 4.8 5.3\nStock-based compensation charges 6.2 0.8\nAdjusted EBITDA1 16.3 8.5\n9 BIOCERES CROP SOLUTIONS FIRST QUARTER 2025\nBioceres Crop Solutions\nNet loss and Operating profit\nOther income / loss for the period ended September 30, 2024, includes a $1.0 million gain from a bargain\npurchase related to a non-material business combination completed on June 10, 2024.

Financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. All comparisons in this announcement are year-over-year (YoY), unless otherwise noted. \n\n**Financial & Business Highlights**\n\n  * **Total revenues in 1Q25 were $93.3 million,** compared to $116.6 million in the same quarter last year. Results were driven by performance in Argentina, where the summer crop season began at an unusually slow pace due to delayed rains and just-in-time purchasing behavior. North America and Brazil gained momentum, despite lingering market headwinds, and partially offset the soft performance in Argentina. \n  * **Operating profit** 1 **was $3.4 million and net loss** 1 **was $5.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA** 1 **for the quarter was $8.5 million.**\n  * **RinoTec technology received EPA’s Green Chemistry Challenge Award** in the Design of Safer and Degradable Chemicals category. \n  * **Regulatory approvals for HB4 soybean production were obtained in Uruguay and Bolivia** , marking full clearance for the technology across all soybean producing countries in the Americas. \n\n\n\n**Management Review**\n\nMr. Federico Trucco, Bioceres´ Chief Executive Officer, commented: “As farmers understand better than anyone else, agriculture is inherently dependent on weather. While, as a technology company we are dedicated to helping farmers navigate this reality, our business cycle also faces weather-related impacts. To mitigate these effects, we rely on portfolio diversification across product types, usage timing, and multiple crops. However, much like in farming itself, geographic diversification remains the most effective hedge against weather events. \n\nThis quarter, we saw the benefits of this strategy, with positive contributions from Brazil, the United Sates, and our Syngenta collaboration outside of Argentina. Together, these almost doubled their share of total sales and, even more importantly, expanded their contribution to total gross profit by 2.5 times. This positive international performance, coupled with fully normalized rainfall in Argentina, allows us to remain optimistic for the rest of the fiscal year. \n\nThat said, we remain focused on cost management and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, aiming to both adapt to and increase our flexibility amid current market conditions. At the same time, our commitment to advancing our unique portfolio of technologies is unaltered, encouraged by the recognition and validation our technologies continue to receive from regulators worldwide, as highlighted in this quarter’s report.” \n\nMr. Enrique Lopez Lecube, Bioceres´ Chief Financial Officer, noted: \"Results for the quarter were marked by a slower-than-usual start to the high season and tough market conditions in Argentina, partially offset by strong performance in North America and Brazil. This highlights the importance of our evolving strategy of geographic and portfolio diversification. Moving forward, capital allocation will continue to prioritize products and technologies with lower-risk and near-term payback periods. Coupled with a more disciplined approach to working capital management, this aims to enhance cash generation for the fiscal year, while preserving the long-term intrinsic value of our unique portfolio of current and future technologies.” \n\n**Key Financial Metrics**\n\n**Table 1:** 1Q25 Key Financial Metrics   \n---  \n(In millions of U.S. dollars)  |  1Q24  |  1Q25  |  %CHANGE   \n**Revenue by Segment**  \nCrop Protection  |  55.9  |  47.7  |  (15%)   \nSeed and Integrated Products  |  22.3  |  19.8  |  (11%)   \nCrop Nutrition  |  38.3  |  25.7  |  (33%)   \n**Total Revenue** |  **116.6** |  **93.3** |  **(20%)**  \nGross Profit  |  45.0  |  37.5  |  (17%)   \n_Gross Margin_ |  _38.6%_ |  _40.2%_ |  _161 bps_  \n  \n1Q24  |  1Q25  |  %CHANGE   \n---|---|---  \n**Net income or loss** 1 |  **(2.7)** |  **(5.3)** |  **(96%)**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** 1 |  **16.3** |  **8.5** |  **(48%)**  \n  \n**1Q25 Summary:** Revenues for the quarter totaled $93.3 million, compared to $116.6 million in the same period last year. The beginning of summer crop planting in Latin America was marked by unfavorable market conditions in Argentina, where a slow start to the season, driven primarily by weather, affected sales of crop protection products and primarily drove results for the country. Sales of micro-beaded fertilizers in Argentina remained under pressure due to an unusual shift of corn acreage into soybeans. Importantly, key markets such as North America and Brazil posted growth, despite lingering headwinds. Gross profit for the quarter was $37.5 million, reflecting a 17% decline, consistent with the decline in sales. However, overall gross margin improved driven by a strategic focus on products with higher margins and more favorable cash conversion cycles, in line with the Company’s strengthened emphasis on cash generation and working capital management. This shift led to a reduced focus on third-party products sales, which faced heightened competition and price pressure in Argentina’s crop protection industry. Operating profit 1 for the quarter was $3.4 million, with a net loss 1 of $5.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter was $8.5 million. \n\n**For a full version of Bioceres’ first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings release, click** [ **here** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.biocerescrops.com%2Ffinancials%2Fresults-center%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150937&newsitemid=20241111759157&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=1ec8c163422e9aa043fea52b087db477) **.**\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call and question-and-answer session, which will be accompanied by a presentation available during the webcast or accessed via the investor relations section of the company’s [website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.biocerescrops.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150937&newsitemid=20241111759157&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=3&md5=be9587b46dc5dfe0eea3d84155f24e58). \n\nTo access the call, please use the following information: \n\n**Date:** Tuesday, November 12, 2024  |  Please dial in 5-10 minutes prior to the start time to register and join.

Financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. All comparisons in this announcement are year-over-year (YoY), unless otherwise noted. \n\n**Financial & Business Highlights**\n\n  * **Total revenues in FY24 were $464.8 million, an 11% growth compared to the year before despite challenging market conditions in some geographies.** Revenue growth in FY24 was largely driven by increases in HB4 sales, adjuvants and biostimulants. Operating profit for the period was $44.8 million with GAAP net income at $6.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year was $81.4 million, steady with respect to last year as growth in the business compensated for the lower accrual of Syngenta´s up-front payment versus last year. \n  * **Revenues in 4Q24 were $124.0 million, an 18% growth compared to the year before,** primarily led by higher HB4 sales. Operating profit was $9.5 million, and GAAP net loss was $2.1 million in 4Q24, improving by 86% and 25%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $19.9 million, almost doubling last year´s metric. \n  * **HB4 Wheat approved for cultivation in the United States,** the fourth largest wheat producer in the world and the largest in the Americas. United States is now the fourth country in the world to greenlight production of HB4 wheat, following Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. \n\n\n\n**Management Review**\n\nMr. Federico Trucco, Bioceres´ Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In fiscal year 2024 we consolidated Bioceres’ financial performance at record-high revenue and adjusted EBITDA levels, despite it having been another challenging year for agriculture, with on-farm economics declining in key crops and geographies. The annual result was achieved through sales growth and an almost doubling of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth and final quarter of the year, with close to half of the increased profitability of the quarter resulting from the HB4 business. \n\n_________________________________  \n---  \n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See “ _Use of non-IFRS financial information_ ” for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation from the most comparable financial measure.   \n  \n“We are increasingly excited by the prospects for our most innovative technologies. Earlier in the fiscal year, we obtained patent protection for our UHC biological nitrogen fixation solution, as well as regulatory clearance for our bio-insecticide platform in Brazil, both of which are critical for near-term expansion in the high-growth seed-applied technologies market. More recently, we received notice from APHIS that green-lights cultivation of HB4 wheat in the U.S., an outcome which was long awaited. This regulatory endorsement helps us in markets where we are already scaling HB4 sales, as it provides additional validation or regulatory comfort. In the medium term, it allows us to expand into a new and important geography, potentially doubling the combined opportunity of Latin America and Australia. \n\n“As we look ahead, we remain focused on launching and scaling our portfolio of unique technologies, while constantly engaging with farmers and other stakeholders to fine-tune our value proposition and market access strategies.” \n\nMr. Enrique Lopez Lecube, Bioceres' Chief Financial Officer, noted: “Our financial results for FY24 demonstrate once again the resilience of our business and the strategic value of maintaining a diversified yet coherent and continuously evolving portfolio of technologies. In the fourth quarter, we increased our profitability across operating profit and net income and doubled adjusted EBITDA, despite encountering challenging conditions for certain products in the final months of the fiscal year, particularly fertilizers, that impeded our ability to excel in every aspect and achieve annual EBITDA growth from last year’s record high. Annually we achieved top line growth and maintained our full-year adjusted EBITDA above last year’s $81 million threshold, while successfully managing our cost base within a context of industry-wide headwinds that prevailed for most of the year. We intend this year’s result to be a steppingstone towards greater performance as we continue expanding our business with a focus on profitability and enhanced financial performance.” \n\n**Key Financial Metrics**\n\n**Table 1:**  \n---  \n4Q24 & FY24 Key Financial Metrics   \n(In millions of U.S. dollars)  |  4Q23  |  4Q24  |  %CHANGE  |  FY23  |  FY24  |  %CHANGE   \n**Revenue by Segment**  \nCrop Protection  |  45.1  |  53.2  |  18%  |  206.1  |  227.2  |  10%   \nSeed and Integrated Products  |  20.8  |  33.3  |  60%  |  56.7  |  96.4  |  70%   \nCrop Nutrition  |  38.8  |  37.5  |  (3%)  |  157.3  |  141.2  |  (10%)   \n**Total Revenue** |  **104.7** |  **124.0** |  **18%** |  **420.1** |  **464.8** |  **11%**  \nGross Profit  |  40.2  |  47.4  |  18%  |  184.6  |  186.6  |  1%   \n_Gross Margin_ |  _38.4%_ |  _38.3%_ |  _(15 bps)_ |  _43.9%_ |  _40.1%_ |  _(381 bps)_  \n4Q23  |  4Q24  |  %CHANGE  |  FY23  |  FY24  |  %CHANGE   \n**GAAP net income or loss** |  **(2.8)** |  **(2.1)** |  **25%** |  **20.2** |  **6.2** |  **(69%)**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **10.5** |  **19.9** |  **90%** |  **81.2** |  **81.4** |  **0%**  \n  \n**4Q24 Summary:** Quarterly revenues were $124.0 million, an 18% increase compared to the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, revenue growth was led by HB4 sales as the winter wheat season got underway in the southern hemisphere. Gross profit was $47.4 million, an 18% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by HB4 in Seed and Integrated Products and gross margin expansion in Crop Protection. Operating profit reached $9.5 million, and GAAP net loss was $2.1 million, improving by 86% and 25% compared to the previous year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.9 million, almost doubling last year´s metric, on the back of improved gross profit and operational leverage. \n\n**FY24 Summary:** Total revenues reached $464.8 million in FY24, an 11% year-over-year increase. Growth for the year was primarily driven by the normalization of weather conditions in the southern hemisphere, with HB4 sales, adjuvants, and other crop protection products leading the growth. Biostimulant sales in Europe also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Gross profit remained flat given the lower accrual of Syngenta’s upfront payment in the product mix compared to the previous year. GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA were $6.2 million and $81.4 million, respectively, compared to $20.2 million and $81.2 million in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA showed little change year over year, in line with gross profit performance. Deliberate cost management resulted in SG&A growth being almost entirely attributable to variable expenses which, combined with improved JV results and other income and expenses performance, resulted in steady profitability for the year. \n\n**For a full version of Bioceres’ fourth quarter & full fiscal year 2024 earnings release, click** [ **here** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.biocerescrops.com%2Ffinancials%2Fresults-center%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54119627&newsitemid=20240909176775&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=6ca4ae9f793d09f01b4d7433105cfd5c) **.**\n\n**Fourth Quarter & Full Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call and question-and-answer session, which will be accompanied by a presentation available during the webcast or accessed via the investor relations section of the company’s [website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.biocerescrops.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54119627&newsitemid=20240909176775&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=3&md5=063cc677885c5b2769dc801d1c7b03b0) . \n\nTo access the call, please use the following information: \n\n**Date:** Tuesday, September 10, 2024  |  Please dial in 5-10 minutes prior to the start time to register and join.
