Order intake in the third\nquarter 2024 thus totaled EUR 143.5 million, a significant 21% increase over the same\nquarter of the previous year (Q3/2023: EUR 118.5 million). At EUR 439.5 million, order\nintake in the first nine months of 2024 was slightly above the previous year's level\n(9M/2023: EUR 436.2 million). The equipment order backlog as of September 30, 2024\nincreased significantly to EUR 384.5 million (September 30, 2023: EUR 368.0 million; June\n30, 2024: EUR 400.6 million).\nRevenues in the first nine months of 2024 totaled EUR 406.4 million and were therefore\nroughly on par with the previous year (9M/2023: EUR 415.7 million). In the third quarter\n2024, revenues of EUR 156.3 million (Q3/2023: EUR 165.0 million) were in the lower half\nof the forecast range of EUR 150 million to EUR 180 million, as the shipment of a larger\nproject was pushed from Q3 to Q4/2024 at the customer's request.\nThe gross profit in 9M/2024 was EUR 160.0 million (9M/2023: EUR 180.8 million) with a\ngross margin of 39% (9M/2023: 43%). The gross profit in Q3/2024 totaled\nEUR 67.1 million with a gross margin of 43% (Q3/2023: EUR 76.2 million, 46%). The\nchange compared to the same period of the previous year is mainly due to a change in\nthe product mix. This included a high proportion of lower-margin LED systems.\nAt EUR 29.6 million, operating expenses in the third quarter 2024 were slightly below the\nprevious year's level (Q3/2023: EUR 30.9 million). At the end of September, operating\nexpenses for the year to date totaled EUR 99.7 million, an increase of 14% compared to\nthe same period in 2023 (EUR 87.4 million). Investments in research and development\ncontinued to account for the largest share of this increase. Accordingly, R&D expenses\nrose by 15% to EUR 68.7 million in the first nine months (9M/2023: EUR 59.8 million). In\nthe third quarter 2024, R&D expenses totaled EUR 21.2 million (Q3/2023: EUR 20.8\nmillion).\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe operating result (EBIT) totaled EUR 60.3 million in the first nine months of 2024,\nwhich corresponds to an EBIT margin of 15% (9M/2023: EUR 93.4 million, 22%). In\nQ3/2024, AIXTRON achieved an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 37.5 million and an EBIT\nmargin of 24% (Q3/2023: EUR 45.3 million, 27%). The decline in the operating result\n(EBIT) compared to the previous year is mainly due to the lower gross margin as a result\nof the change in the product mix and the increase in R&D expenses. Profit for the period\ntotaled EUR 52.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 (9M/2023: EUR 83.5 million;\nQ3/2024: EUR 30.9 million; Q3/2023: EUR 39.6 million).\nAt EUR 15.4 million in third quarter 2024 (Q3/2023: EUR 4.9 million) and EUR 28.2 million\nin the first nine months of 2024 (9M/2023: EUR -65.6 million), the cash flow from\noperating activities was significantly higher than in the previous year. The reduced\nbuildup in working capital had a positive impact here. A first reduction in inventories took\nplace in the third quarter 2024. Free cash flow in Q3/2024 was EUR -1.5 million\n(Q3/2023: EUR -2.2 million) and EUR -58.0 million in the first nine months of 2024\n(9M/2023: EUR -82.3 million), a significant improvement on the previous year despite the\nsignificantly higher capital expenditure for the innovation center and the expansion of\nproduction capacity in Italy.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including other current financial assets of\nEUR 78.1 million as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024: EUR 79.4 million; December\n31, 2023: EUR 181.7 million. The equity ratio as at September 30, 2024 was 79%\n(December 31, 2023: 75%).\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2023. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2023 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n9M 2024 9M 2023 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 439.5 436.2 3.3 1\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 384.5 368.0 16.5 4\nWith EUR 439.5 million order intake for the first nine months of 2024 was slightly up on\nthe previous year (9M/2023: EUR 436.2 million). At 58%, the power electronics segment\n(SiC and GaN) in particular made a significant contribution to order intake for systems.\nOrder intake in the third quarter 2024 amounted to EUR 143.5 million and was\nsignificantly higher than in the previous year (Q3/2023: EUR 118.5 million).\nAt EUR 384.5 million, the system order backlog as at September 30, 2024 significantly\nexceeded the level at the end of 2023 (31. Dezember 2023: EUR 353.7 million) and was\nalso up on the previous year (September 30, 2023: EUR 368.0 million).\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024\nwas 1.09 USD/EUR (Q1/2024: 1.09; Q2/2024: 1.08; Q3/2024: 1.09) against 1.08 USD/EUR\nin 9M/2023. Compared to the previous year's average, the US dollar thus depreciated by\n1% in 9M/2024, with a corresponding effect on the US dollar-based revenues of the\nAIXTRON Group in the course of the first nine months of fiscal year 2024.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 amounted to EUR 406.4\nmillion and were roughly on a par with the same period of the previous year (9M/2023:\nEUR 415.7 million). Compared to the previous quarter, revenues in third quarter 2024\nincreased by 19% to EUR 156.3 million (Q2/2024: EUR 131.8 million; Q3/2023: EUR 165.0\nmillion).\nIn the first nine months of 2024, 57% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC).\nThe LED segment, including Micro LED, accounted for 26% of equipment revenues in the\nfirst nine months of 2024. Business with systems for optoelectronics, in particular for the\nproduction of lasers for optical data transmission and 3D sensor technology, contributed\na further 11% of equipment revenues.\nEquipment revenues in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 were EUR 326.1 million,\nrepresenting 80% of the total revenues in the period (9M/2023: EUR 347.6 million; 84%).\nIn the third quarter 2024 equipment sales amounted to EUR 127.9 million or 82% of sales\n(Q3/2023: EUR 141.8 million, 86% of sales).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the after sales business with the sale of\nconsumables, spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n9M 2024 9M 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 326.1 80 347.6 84 -21.5 -6\nRevenues from service,\n80.3 20 68.1 16 12.2 18\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 406.4 100 415.7 100 -9.3 -2\nRevenues by Region\n9M 2024 9M 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 250.2 62 181.3 44 68.9 38\nEurope 113.6 28 139.1 33 -25.5 -18\nAmericas 42.6 10 95.3 23 -52.7 -55\nTotal 406.4 100 415.7 100 -9.3 -2\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n9M 2024 9M 2023 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

This development was mainly due to higher R&D expenses.\nCompared to Q2/2024, operating expenses in Q3/2024 decreased by EUR 6.7 million.\nR&D expenses for the further development of existing systems and new generations of\nsystems increased by EUR 8.9 million to EUR 68.7 million in the first nine months of 2024\n(9M/2023: EUR 59.8 million). R&D expenses decreased from EUR 24.6 million in Q2/2024\nto EUR 21.2 million in Q3/2024.\nKey R&D Information\n9M 2024 9M 2023 +/-\nR&D expenses (in EUR million) 68.7 59.8 15%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 17 14 3 pp\nNet other operating income and expenses resulted in an operating income of EUR 3.9\nmillion in 9M/2024 (9M/2023: EUR 6.7 million; Q3/2024: EUR 3.5 million). In particular,\nthis reflects income from fund investments in the amount of EUR 1.0 million (9M/2023:\nEUR 3.6 million; Q3/2024: EUR 0.0 million), R&D grants of EUR 2.8 million (9M/2023: EUR\n4.3 million; Q3/2024: EUR 1.3 million) and income from exchange rate valuation of EUR\n0.1 million (9M/2023: expense EUR 1.0 million; Q3/2024: income EUR 2.2 million).\nThe operating result (EBIT) was EUR 60.3 million in 9M/2024 (9M/2023: EUR 93.4 million;\nQ3/2024: EUR 37.5 million). Compared to the same period of the previous year, this\ndevelopment is mainly due to a lower gross margin and increased operating expenses for\nresearch and development.\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe result before taxes in the reporting period amounted to EUR 61.2 million (9M/2023:\nEUR 93.9 million; Q3/2024: EUR 37.7 million).\nThe tax expense in 9M/2024 was EUR 8.4 million (9M/2023: tax expense of EUR 10.4\nmillion; Q3/2024: tax expense EUR 6.8 million). This mainly consists of a tax expense from\ncurrent taxes of EUR 8.5 million (9M/2023: EUR 12.2 million; Q3/2024: EUR 4.7 million)\nand a deferred tax income of EUR 0.1 million (9M/2023: income of EUR 1.9 million;\nQ3/2024: expense of EUR 2.1 million).\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first nine months of 2024 was EUR 52.9 million\n(9M/2023: EUR 83.5 million; Q3/2024: EUR 30.9 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of September 30, 2024, as well as\nDecember 31, 2023. The unused revolving credit facility amounted to EUR 200.0 million\nas of September 30, 2024.\nTotal equity as of September 30, 2024, increased to EUR 789.9 million compared to EUR\n777.6 million as of December 31, 2023, which is mainly due to the profit for the period.\nThe equity ratio as of September 30, 2024 increased compared to December 31, 2023\nfrom 75% to 79%.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets decreased to EUR 78.1 million\nas of September 30, 2024, compared to EUR 181.7 million as of December 31, 2023. This\ndevelopment is mainly due to the dividend payment of EUR 45.0 million, the investments\nin the Innovation Center and the new production site in Italy. In the first nine months of\n2024, fund investments worth EUR 82.2 million were sold. Other current financial assets\nas of September 30, 2024, now include total fund investments of EUR 0.5 million\n(December 31, 2023: EUR 83.7 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of September 30, 2024, increased\nto EUR 224.3 million compared to EUR 147.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\nInvestments in the past quarter included in particular investments in the Innovation\nCenter and laboratory equipment, testing and demonstration facilities and the expansion\nof production space at the Herzogenrath site.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to EUR\n72.3 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no goodwill impairment in the first nine\nmonths of 2024. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2023, are\nattributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, decreased to\nEUR 426.7 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to EUR 447.9 million as of June 30,\n2024, but are still higher than EUR 394.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\nTrade receivables as of September 30, 2024, amounted to EUR 116.4 million (December\n31, 2023: EUR 157.6 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in\nQ3/2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 118.9 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and were lower than at December 31, 2023 (EUR 141.3 million). This\ndevelopment reflects the business performance in the third quarter 2024 compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2023.\nCash Flow\nCash flow from operating activities totaled EUR 28.2 million in the first nine months of\n2024 after EUR -65.6 million in 9M/2023 (Q3/2024: EUR 15.4 million). In the same period\nof the previous year, cash flow from operating activities was still influenced by a sharp\nincrease in working capital.\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property, plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR -58.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 (9M/2023:\nEUR -82.3 million; Q3/2024: EUR -1.5 million). Higher investments due to the construction\nof the Innovation Center and the acquisition of the production site in Italy led to a\nnegative amount despite the strong improvement in cash flow from operating activities.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first nine months of 2024, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2023.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2023 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the current market development, the Executive Board confirms the annual\nguidance for 2024 from July 4, 2024, according to which the Executive Board expects to\ngenerate revenues in the in the range of EUR 620 million to EUR 660 million, a gross\nmargin of around 43% to 45% and an EBIT margin of around 22% to 25% for the 2024\nfinancial year. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the Executive Board expects revenues in\nthe range of around EUR 215 million to EUR 255 million.\nThe medium- and long-term drivers for AIXTRON's revenue growth remain intact:\nefficient GaN power IT and AI applications, SiC technology for e-mobility and Micro LEDs\nfor next-generation displays. In the short term, however, momentum in the end markets\nremains slow, so that, as things stand today, revenues for fiscal year 2025 are likely to\nbe at the level of fiscal year 2024 or slightly below.\nFurther details on the original annual guidance can be found in the “Expected\nDevelopments” section of the Annual Report 2023. Further details on the adjusted annual\nforecast can be found in the corresponding press release dated July 4, 2024 on the\ncompany's website at www.aixtron.com/en/press/press-releases.

The G10 product family,\nconsisting of G10-SiC, G10-GaN and G10-AsP, was the main driver in both the past quarter\nand the first half of the year.\nIn the second quarter, the company recorded an order intake at the record level of the\nsame quarter of the previous year, driven in particular by strong demand from the SiC\nand GaN based power electronics market. While important new SiC customers\nstimulated business in the first quarter - including one of the top five suppliers of SiC\ncomponents and customers from China and Japan - AIXTRON secured major follow-up\norders from existing SiC customers in the past quarter, among others.\nAIXTRON has responded to the expected increase in demand in the coming years by\nacquiring an additional production facility near Turin (Italy).\nAt EUR 296.0 million (H1/2023: EUR 317.7 million), order intake in the first six months of\n2024 remained at a high level. At EUR 175.7 million, order intake in the second quarter of\n2024 matched the record level of the same quarter of the previous year (Q2/2023:\nEUR 177.8 million). A large part of the system orders booked in Q2/2024 will be shipped\nin the next financial year. The equipment order backlog as of June 30, 2024 increased\nsignificantly to EUR 400.6 million (March 31, 2024: EUR 355.0 million; June 30, 2023:\nEUR 412.5 million).\nRevenues in the first six months of 2024 totaled EUR 250.1 million and were on par with\nthe previous year (H1/2023: EUR 250.7 million). In the second quarter 2024, revenues of\nEUR 131.8 million were in the upper half of the forecast range of EUR 120 million to\nEUR 140 million (Q2/2023: EUR 173.5 million). Gross profit in the first six months of 2024\nfell by -11% year-on-year to EUR 92.9 million (H1/2023: EUR 104.6 million) with a gross\nmargin of 37%, which declined mainly due to the product mix in a direct comparison with\nthe previous year (H1/2023: 42%).\nDue to the fact that a significant proportion of the system order intake in the second\nquarter 2024 will not be delivered in the current financial year, the Executive Board\nadjusted the annual forecast for 2024 on July 4, 2024: The Executive Board now\nanticipates revenues between EUR 620 million and EUR 660 million for the 2024 financial\nyear (previously: between EUR 630 million and EUR 720 million), an unchanged gross\nmargin of around 43% - 45% and an EBIT margin of around 22% to 25% (previously: 24%\nto 26%).\n4\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nAIXTRON GROUP\nDue to the reasons mentioned above, revenues in Q2/2024 were EUR 131.8 million\n(Q1/2024: EUR 118.3 million; Q2/2023: EUR 173.5 million). Gross profit in Q2/2024 was\nEUR 49.1 million with a gross margin of 37% (Q1/2024: EUR 43.8 million, 37%; Q2/2023:\nEUR 73.5 million, 42%).\nAt EUR 36.3 million, operating expenses in the second quarter 2024 were higher than in\nthe same period of the previous year (Q2/2023: EUR 28.8 million), primarily due to higher\nR&D expenses. This led to an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 12.9 million with an EBIT\nmargin of 10% (Q2/2023: EUR 44.6 million, 26%). The profit for the period in the second\nquarter 2024 was EUR 11.2 million (Q2/2023: EUR 40.4 million).\nAt EUR 20.2 million, cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter 2024 was\nsignificantly higher than in the same quarter of the previous year (Q2/2023:\nEUR -76.3 million). Free cash flow in Q2/2024 was EUR -23.4 million (Q2/2023:\nEUR -82.0 million). This is mainly due to investments in the Innovation Center and the\nexpansion of production capacities in Italy.\nAfter payment of the dividend of EUR 45.0 million, AIXTRON reported cash and cash\nequivalents including other current financial assets of EUR 79.4 million as of June 30,\n2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 181.7 million). The equity ratio at June 30, 2024 was 75%\n(December 31, 2023: 75%).\n5\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2023. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first six months of fiscal year 2024. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2023 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEconomic Report\nMacroeconomic developments\nThe global economy performed surprisingly well in the first half of 2024 despite\nsignificant interest rate hikes by central banks to restore price stability. The interest rate\nhikes were a reaction to ongoing inflation concerns. Nevertheless, many economies\nrecorded resilient growth rates. In the USA, the economy developed robustly despite\ninterest rate hikes. Growth in the eurozone was mixed, and Asia also showed different\ntrends: China recorded solid growth despite the property crisis, India's economy proved\nrobust and Japan struggled with demographic challenges.\nIn this environment, the IMF confirmed its growth forecasts for the current year in its\nWorld Economic Outlook of July 2024. For 2024 as a whole, the IMF expects global\neconomic output to grow by 3.2% (2023: 3.3%). The expected growth rate for\nindustrialized nations is 1.7% (2023: 1.7%), while the growth rate for emerging and\ndeveloping countries is expected to be 4.3% (2023: 4.4%).1\nIn May 2024, the German mechanical and plant engineering industry recorded a tense\nsituation. According to reports from the German Engineering Federation (VDMA), orders\nin the three-month period from March to May 2024 fell by 9% compared to the previous\nyear. Domestic orders fell by 42%, while foreign orders recorded an increase of 13%.\nDemand from the European region fell short of the previous year's level by 7%, while\nincoming orders from non-European countries increased by 23%.2\nDemand for AIXTRON products remains largely dependent on industry-specific\ndevelopments, e.g. the introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, IT\ninfrastructure, electromobility or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor\nmarket, which remained very robust overall.\nThe current global crisis situations and market and geopolitical developments continue to\nhave only a minor impact on our business overall.\n1 IWF: World Economic Outlook Update, July 2024\n2 VDMA, Incoming orders in mechanical and plant engineering, May 2024\n7\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIndustry developments\nLasers that can be manufactured on AIXTRON systems have a wide range of applications\nin the areas of 3D Sensing technology and optical data transmission: According to the\nmarket research company Yole Group, consumer electronics will be the main driver of\ndemand for lasers in this area over the next few years of 3D Sensing. In addition, edge\nand surface emitting lasers in the field of 3D Sensing technology are increasingly being\nused in industry and the automotive sector.\nThe market for lasers for optical data transmission at the speed of light is being\npositively influenced in particular by the increasing use of cloud computing and Internet\nservices such as video-on-demand and music streaming, as well as the communication of\nnetworked devices via the Internet (“Internet-of-Things”). The rapidly growing spread of\napplications in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the resulting high data volumes\nare expected to generate additional demand for optical data transmission.\nThe most important growth market for AIXTRON is the area of power electronics: Power\nsemiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials enable the production of\nvery compact and highly efficient converters between direct and alternating current,\nwhich are used in a wide range of applications. These range from low (e.g. power packs\nfor smartphones) to the highest power (e.g. fast charging stations for electric vehicles).\nPower devices based on the material systems silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride\n(GaN) are gaining market share in the overall market for power components with\nincreasing speed. GaN semiconductor devices are mainly used in the low and medium\npower and voltage ranges, such as in high-performance and energy-efficient power\nsupplies for smartphones and laptops, in wireless charging or in power supplies for\nservers and other IT infrastructure. In addition, customers are constantly developing new\napplications, for example in the area of data centers, in IT infrastructure and with micro\ninverters in the field of photovoltaics or mobile charging technology in the field of\nelectromobility. In addition, the customer base for AIXTRON systems for the production\nof GaN semiconductor devices is continuously expanding, while existing customers are\nexpanding their production capacities.\nWBG power devices made of silicon carbide (SiC) are particularly suitable for use in\nhigher power and voltage classes. Areas of application are primarily electric vehicles and\ntheir fast-charging stations, but also converters in the field of photovoltaics, wind energy\nand other electrical drives. In these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in\nconversion losses, which leads to a greater range per battery charge in vehicles and to a\nhigher amount of energy output in the area of energy production. Due to the diverse\napplication possibilities and the high efficiency, industry experts expect strong growth in\nthe coming years for both GaN and SiC devices.\nAccording to LEDinside, the micro LEDs segment represents a high growth potential in\noptoelectronics. Potential drivers are Augmented Reality devices (AR), Automotive and\nlarge displays for signage or TV. Micro LED technology is currently still at an early stage in\nthe development process, so estimates of the future market size by various analysts still\ndiffer greatly.\n8\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nHowever, according to Yole, further growth is also predicted for the market for red,\norange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) due to the worldwide use of directly emitting, large-\narea LED display walls or backlighting units.\nThe growth forecasts for the market segments described here are detailed in the\neconomic report of our 2023 Annual Report. We continue to regard these as valid.\nAccording to the current analysis by the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON has\nincreased its global market leadership for MOCVD systems in 2023.\n9\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nH1 2024 H1 2023 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 296.0 317.7 -21.7 -7\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 400.6 412.5 -11.9 -3\nOrder intake for the first six months of 2024 was at a high level at EUR 296.0 million\n(H1/2023: EUR 317.7 million). At 66%, the power electronics segment (SiC and GaN) in\nparticular made a significant contribution to order intake for systems. At EUR 175.7\nmillion in the second quarter 2024, order intake was on a par with the previous year and\nsignificantly higher than the previous quarter (Q1/2024: EUR 120.3 million; Q2/2023: EUR\n177.8 million).\nDue to the strong order intake in the current quarter, the system order backlog as of June\n30, 2024 significantly exceeds the level at the end of 2023 (31. Dezember 2023: EUR\n353.7 million) and is on par with the previous year at EUR 400.6 million (June 30, 2023:\nEUR 412.5 million).\nAs part of a strict internal process, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in the order intake and order backlog. These\nconditions include the following requirements:\n• the existence of a firm written order,\n• the receipt or security of an agreed down payment,\n• the availability of all documents required for the delivery,\n• the agreement of a delivery date confirmed by the customer.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Executive Board\nreserves the right to check whether the actual implementation of each order within a\nreasonable period of time is also sufficiently probable. If, as part of this review, the\nExecutive Board comes to the conclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently\nprobable or involves an excessively high risk, this specific order or a part of this order is\nnot included in the order intake or so long from recording excluded from order intake and\norder backlog until risk is reduced to an acceptable level. The order backlog is regularly\nevaluated and – if necessary – adjusted according to possible delivery risks.\n10\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON in the first six months of fiscal year 2024\nwas 1.08 USD/EUR (Q2/2024: 1.08; Q1/2024: 1.09) against 1.08 USD/EUR in H1/2023.\nCompared to the previous year's average, the US dollar thus depreciated by 1% in\nH1/2024, with a corresponding effect on the US dollar-based revenues of the AIXTRON\nGroup in the course of the first six months of fiscal year 2024.\n11\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 amounted to EUR 250.1 million\nand were on a par with the same period of the previous year (H1/2023: EUR 250.7\nmillion). This high level is mainly due to the increasing demand for systems in the area of\nPower Electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) as well as in the\narea of LEDs, including micro LEDs. Compared to the previous quarter, revenues in second\nquarter 2024 increased by 11% to EUR 131.8 million (Q1/2024: EUR 118.3 million;\nQ2/2023: EUR 173.5 million).\nIn the first six months of 2024, 52% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics. The LED segment, including Micro LED, accounted for\n32% of equipment revenues in the first six months of 2024. Business with systems for\noptoelectronics, in particular for the production of lasers for optical data transmission\nand 3D sensor technology, contributed a further 9% of equipment revenues.\nEquipment revenues in the first six months of fiscal year 2024 were EUR 198.1 million,\nrepresenting 79% of the total revenues in the period (H1/2023: EUR 205.8 million; 82%).\nIn the second quarter 2024 equipment sales amounted to EUR 105.1 million or 80% of\nsales (Q1/2024: EUR 93.0 million, 79% of sales; Q2/2023: EUR 149.4 million, 86% of\nsales).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the after sales business with the sale of\nconsumables, spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nH1 2024 H1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 198.1 79 205.8 82 -7.7 -4\nRevenues from service,\n52.0 21 44.9 18 7.1 16\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 250.1 100 250.7 100 -0.6 0\nRevenues by Region\nH1 2024 H1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 161.2 65 125.4 50 35.8 29\nEurope 68.0 27 72.6 29 -4.6 -6\nAmericas 20.9 8 52.7 21 -31.8 -60\nTotal 250.1 100 250.7 100 -0.6 0\n12\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nH1 2024 H1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

This development is mainly the\nresult of a lower gross margin and increased operating expenses for research and\ndevelopment.\nThe result before taxes in the reporting period amounted to EUR 23.5 million (H1/2023:\nEUR 48.4 million; Q2/2024: EUR 13.1 million; Q1/2024: EUR 10.4 million).\nThe tax expense in H1/2024 was EUR 1.6 million (H1/2023: tax expense of EUR 4.5\nmillion; Q2/2024: tax expense EUR 2.1 million; Q1/2024: tax income of EUR 0.5 million).\nThis consists of a tax expense from current taxes of EUR 3.8 million (H1/2023:\nEUR 6.0 million; Q2/2024: EUR 2.5 million; Q1/2024: EUR 1.3 million) and a deferred tax\nincome of EUR 2.2 million (H1/2023: EUR 1.5 million; Q2/2024: EUR 0.4 million; Q1/2024:\nEUR 1.8 million) primarily from the capitalization of deferred taxes on tax loss\ncarryforwards due to expected future profits.\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first six months of 2024 was EUR 22.0 million\n(H1/2023: EUR 43.9 million; Q2/2024: EUR 11.2 million; Q1/2024: EUR 10.8 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of June 30, 2024, as well as December\n31, 2023. Unused credit facilities amounted to EUR 45.0 million as of June 30, 2024. These\nwere terminated after the reporting date of June 30, 2024, due to the conclusion of a\nnew revolving credit facility amounting to a total of EUR 200.0 million.\nTotal equity as of June 30, 2024, decreased to EUR 758.1 million compared to EUR 777.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, which is mainly due to the dividend distribution. The\nequity ratio as of June 30, 2024, was unchanged compared to December 31, 2023, at\n75%.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets decreased to EUR 79.4 million\nas of June 30, 2024, compared to EUR 181.7 million as of December 31, 2023. This\ndevelopment is mainly due to the dividend payment of EUR 45.0 million and the\ninvestments in the Innovation Center and the new production site in Italy. In the first six\nmonths of 2024, fund investments worth EUR 82.2 million were sold. Other current\nfinancial assets as of June 30, 2024, now include total fund investments of EUR 0.5 million\n(December 31, 2023: EUR 83.7 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of June 30, 2024, increased to EUR\n209.8 million compared to EUR 147.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Investments in the\npast quarter included in particular investments in the Innovation Center and laboratory\nequipment, testing and demonstration facilities, expansion of production space at the\nHerzogenrath site and the acquisition of the production site in Italy.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.9 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to EUR 72.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. There was no goodwill impairment in the first six\nmonths of 2024. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2023, are\nattributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\n14\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to EUR\n447.9 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to EUR 394.5 million as of December 31,\n2023. This development is related to the inventory build-up in preparation for the higher\nexpected business volumes in the upcoming quarters.\nTrade receivables as of June 30, 2024, amounted to EUR 117.0 million (December 31,\n2023: EUR 157.6 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in Q2/2024\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 133.0 million as of June 30,\n2024, at comparable level as of December 31, 2023 (EUR 141.3 million).\nCash Flow\nCash flow from operating activities totaled EUR 12.8 million in the first half of the year\nafter EUR -70.5 million in H1/2023 (Q2/2024: EUR 20.2 million; Q1/2024: EUR -7.4\nmillion). In the same period of the previous year, cash flow from operating activities was\nstill influenced by a sharp increase in working capital.\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property, plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR -56.5 million in first six months of 2024 (H1/2023: EUR\n-80.1 million; Q2/2024: EUR -23.4 million; Q1/2024: EUR -33.1 million). Higher\ninvestments due to the construction of the Innovation Center and the acquisition of the\nproduction site in Italy led to a negative amount despite the strong improvement in cash\nflow from operating activities.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first six months of 2024, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2023.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2023 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n15\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT H1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the fact that a significant proportion of the system order intake in the second\nquarter of 2024 will not be delivered in the current financial year, the Executive Board\nadjusted the 2024 annual forecast originally published in February on July 4, 2024.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board now expects to generate revenues in the in the range of\nEUR 620 million to EUR 660 million (previously: EUR 630 million and EUR 720 million), a\ngross margin of around 43% to 45% (unchanged) and an EBIT margin of around 22% to\n25% (previously: 24% to 26%) for the 2024 financial year.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Executive Board expects revenues in the range of EUR\n150 million to EUR 180 million.\nFurther details on the original annual guidance can be found in the “Expected\nDevelopments” section of the Annual Report 2023.

AIXTRON benefits from the high competitiveness of the G10 product\nfamily, consisting of G10-SiC, G10-GaN and G10-AsP. This highly competitive offering\nenables AIXTRON to defend and further expand its leading position in all addressed\nmarkets. This is underlined by new customer wins in SiC power electronics and recent\nawards such as the Gold Supplier Award from leading Micro LED supplier BOE HC\nSemiTek.\nIn the area of SiC power electronics, further new customers were won thanks to\ntechnological advances, including one of the top-5 suppliers of SiC components. These\nadvances also led to orders from other new customers, including several customers from\nJapan, as well as a major order from China.\nAt EUR 120.3 million (Q1/2023: EUR 139.9 million), order intake in the first three months\nof 2024 was at a high level across all areas. The equipment order backlog as of March 31,\n2024 was stable at around EUR 355.0 million (December 31, 2023: EUR 353.7 million).\nAt EUR 118.3 million, revenues in the first three months of 2024 were significantly higher\nand increased by 53% compared to the previous year (Q1/2023: EUR 77.2 million). They\nare therefore at the upper end of the guidance range of EUR 100 million to EUR 120\nmillion.\nDue to the good start into the new financial year, the Executive Board fully confirms the\nfull-year guidance for 2024: The Executive Board expects revenues of between EUR 630\nmillion and EUR 720 million, a gross margin of around 43% - 45% and an EBIT margin of\naround 24% to 26% for the 2024 financial year.\nGross profit in first three months of 2024 increased by 41% year-on-year to\nEUR 43.8 million (Q1/2023: EUR 31.1 million) with a gross margin of 37%, which fell\nslightly year-on-year due to the product mix (Q1/2023: 40%).\nAt EUR 33.8 million, operating expenses in the first three months of 2024 were higher\nthan in the same period of the previous year (Q1/2023: EUR 27.6 million), primarily due\nto higher R&D expenses. This led to an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 9.9 million with an\nEBIT margin of 8% (Q1/2023: EUR 3.5 million, 5%). The profit for the period in the first\nthree months of 2024 was EUR 10.8 million (Q1/2023: EUR 3.5 million).\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nAIXTRON GROUP\nFree cash flow in Q1/2024 was EUR -33.1 million (Q1/2023: EUR 1.9 million). This is\nmainly due to the further slight increase in inventories in preparation for a\ncorrespondingly high business volume in the following quarters and the investments in\nthe Innovation Center.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including other current financial assets of\nEUR 148.5 million as of March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 181.7 million). The\nequity ratio at March 31, 2024 was 76% (December 31, 2023: 75%).\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2023. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first three months of fiscal year 2024. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2023 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 120.3 139.9 -19.6 -14\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 355.0 417.9 -62.9 -15\nOrder intake for the first three months of 2024 was at a high level at EUR 120.3 million\n(Q1/2023: EUR 139.9 million). With 37%, the Micro LED area in particular made a\nsignificant contribution to incoming equipment orders.\nAt EUR 355.0 million, the total equipment order backlog as of March 31, 2024 remained\nstable at the level at the end of 2023 (December 31, 2023: EUR 353.7 million) and was\nbelow the previous year’s level (March 31, 2023: EUR 417.9 million) due to the significant\nincrease in delivery volumes.\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first three months of fiscal year 2024 was 1.09 USD/EUR\nagainst 1.07 USD/EUR in Q1/2023. Compared to the previous year's average, the US\ndollar thus depreciated by 2% in Q1/2024, with a corresponding effect on the US dollar-\nbased revenues of the AIXTRON Group in the course of the first three months of fiscal\nyear 2024.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first three months of fiscal year 2024 amounted to EUR 118.3\nmillion and were EUR 41.1 million or 53% higher year-on-year (Q1/2023: EUR 77.2\nmillion). This high level is mainly due to the increasing demand for systems in the area of\nPower Electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) as well as in\nthe area of Micro LEDs.\nIn the first three months of 2024, 62% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics. The LED segment, including Micro LED, accounted for\n21% of equipment revenues in the first three months of 2024, which underlines the\ncorresponding market momentum. Business with systems for optoelectronics, in\nparticular for the production of lasers for optical data transmission and 3D sensor\ntechnology, contributed a further 11% of equipment revenues.\nEquipment revenues in the first three months of fiscal year 2024 were EUR 93.0 million,\nrepresenting 79% of the total revenues in the period (Q1/2023: EUR 56.4 million; 73%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the after sales business with the sale of\nconsumables, spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 93.0 79 56.4 73 36.6 65\nRevenues from service,\n25.3 21 20.8 27 4.5 22\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 118.3 100 77.2 100 41.1 53\nRevenues by Region\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 68.6 58 36.2 47 32.4 90\nEurope 38.2 32 21.6 28 16.6 77\nAmericas 11.5 10 19.4 25 -7.9 -41\nTotal 118.3 100 77.2 100 41.1 53\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

This reflects the increased income from fund investments in\nthe amount of EUR 0.8 million (Q1/2023: income EUR 1.3 million; Q4/2023: income\nEUR 1.3 million), R&D grants of EUR 0.9 million (Q1/2023: EUR 0.9 million; Q4/2023: EUR\n2.5 million) and expenses from exchange rate valuation of EUR 1.2 million (Q1/2023:\nincome EUR 0.4 million; Q4/2023: income EUR 1.8 million).\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved significantly year-on-year from EUR 3.5 million in\nQ1/2023 to EUR 9.9 million in Q1/2024 (Q4/2023: EUR 63.4 million). This development is\nmainly due to significant increase in revenues and the resulting gross profit.\nThe result before taxes in the first three months of 2024 was EUR 10.4 million (Q1/2023:\nEUR 3.6 million; Q4/2023: EUR 63.8 million).\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe tax income in Q1/2024 was EUR 0.5 million (Q1/2023: tax expense of EUR 0.1 million;\nQ4/2023: tax expense of EUR 2.1 million). This consists of a tax expense from current\ntaxes of EUR 1.3 million (Q1/2023: EUR 0.2 million, Q4/2023: EUR 7.4 million) and a tax\nincome from the capitalization of deferred taxes on loss carryforwards of EUR 1.8 million\n(Q1/2023: EUR 0.0 million; Q4/2023: EUR 5.3 million) due to expected future profits.\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first three months of 2024 significantly\nincreased to EUR 10.8 million (Q1/2023: EUR 3.5 million; Q4/2023: EUR 61.7 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of March 31, 2024 as well as\nDecember 31, 2023.\nTotal equity as of March 31, 2024, increased to EUR 790.4 million compared to EUR 777.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The main contributor was the profit for the period. The\nequity ratio as of March 31, 2024, was 76% compared to 75% as of 31 December 2023.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets decreased to EUR 148.5 million\nas of March 31, 2024, compared to EUR 181.7 million as of December 31, 2023. This\ndevelopment is mainly due to a slight increase in inventories in preparation for a\ncorrespondingly high business volume in the following quarters as well as investments in\nthe Innovation Center. In the first three months of 2024, fund investments worth EUR\n28.8 million were sold. Other current financial assets as of March 31, 2024, now include\ntotal fund investments of EUR 54.3 million (December 31, 2023: EUR 83.7 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of March 31, 2024, increased\nslightly to EUR 169.9 million compared to EUR 147.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\nInvestments in the past quarter included, in particular, investments in the Innovation\nCenter as well as laboratory equipment, demo laboratory facilities and production site\nexpansions.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.7 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to EUR 72.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. There was no goodwill impairment in the first three\nmonths of 2024. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2023 are attributable\nto exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to EUR\n436.4 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to EUR 394.5 million as of December 31,\n2023. This development is related to the inventory build-up in preparation for the higher\nexpected business volumes in the upcoming quarters.\nTrade receivables as of March 31, 2024, amounted to EUR 118.0 million (December 31,\n2023: EUR 157.6 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in Q1/2024\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 138.3 million as of March 31,\n2024, at comparable level as of December 31, 2023 (EUR 141.3 million).\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR -33.1 million in first three months of 2024 (Q1/2023: EUR\n1.9 million; Q4/2023: EUR -27.4 million). Significant cash flows in the first three months of\n2024 resulted from a slight increase in inventories in preparation for correspondingly high\nbusiness volumes in the following quarters as well as investments in the Innovation\nCenter.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first three months of 2024, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2023.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2023 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2024\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the good business development in the first three months of 2024 and driven by\nthe continued positive assessment of the development of demand, the Executive Board\nreiterates the growth guidance for 2024.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board expects to generate revenues between EUR 630 million\nand EUR 720 million, a gross margin of around 43% to 45% and an EBIT margin of around\n24% to 26% of revenues in the 2024 financial year.

The company has subsidiaries in Europe, Asia and in the United States and offers\ncustomers high-tech tools that are used in a wide range of high-performance compound\nsemiconductors and optoelectronic applications. These devices are used in a variety of\ninnovative applications and industries, including lasers, LED, display technologies, optical\nand wireless data transmission, SiC and GaN power electronics, and many other leading-\nedge applications. AIXTRON was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Herzogenrath,\nGermany (City Region of Aachen).\nFor further information on AIXTRON (FSE: AIXA, ISIN DE000A0WMPJ6) please visit our\nwebsite at: www.aixtron.com.\nOur registered trademarks: AIXACT®, AIXTRON®, Close Coupled Showerhead®, EXP®, EPISON®, Gas Foil\nRotatio®, OptacapTM, OVPD®, Planetary Reactor®, PVP®, STExS®, TriJet®\n5\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nLetter to Shareholders\nDear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen\nWe are pleased to announce that AIXTRON took another big step forward in the 2023\nfinancial year and continued its successful growth path. We have fully achieved our\nambitious growth targets, fully met our forecast, and further expanded our technological\nleadership and competitive position in all of our material systems. AIXTRON achieved\nsales of EUR 629.9 million (+36%) and achieved an operating result of EUR 156.8 million\n(+50%). This means that AIXTRON's sales have increased by more than 30 percent per\nyear on average since 2020. Order intake also grew significantly again in 2023 to EUR\n640.7 million (+9%).\nOur strong growth in 2023 was primarily driven by the sharp increase in demand for\ncompound semiconductors for efficient power electronics. The materials silicon carbide\n(SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) are being used in more and more technological\napplications due to their outstanding material properties. Optoelectronics and display\ntechnology applications contributed a smaller share of sales in 2023 but will increase\nstrongly again in the current financial year. Our strategy of serving various uncorrelated\nend markets with our systems was successful again in 2023.\nAIXTRON played a decisive role in driving forward the dynamics in the market with the\nsuccessful launch of the G10 product family. In just one year, we have renewed\nAIXTRON's entire product portfolio - starting with the introduction of our G10-SiC,\ncontinued with the G10-AsP and concluded in September 2023 with the G10-GaN. All\nthese solutions succeeded in taking the strong performance indicators of the already very\nsuccessful predecessor products to the next level.\nWith its dual wafer size capability (usable for 150 mm as well as 200 mm wafers), the\nG10-SiC significantly supports the transition of SiC power electronics to 200 mm wafers.\nThe G10-SiC was met with great response from our customers driving the proportion to\nsales to around 30%, made possible as we were able to scale into volume production\nwithin a very short time. Over the course of 2023, we were able to further improve the\nalready strong performance and productivity of this system, so that the G10-SiC now sets\nstandards in terms of performance, stability, productivity and unit costs.\nThe G10-GaN ushered in the era of volume production in the field of GaN power\nsemiconductors. Not only does this system offer further improvements in performance,\nbut above all it addresses the needs of modern mass production: increased productivity,\nreduced space consumption, longer maintenance intervals with reduced maintenance\neffort and a further significant reduction in production costs per wafer.\nThe G10-AsP, which was introduced at the beginning of the year, is the first system to\nenable robust large-scale production of micro LED and laser components. In doing so, we\nhave remained true to our original market – optoelectronics. This system has set\nstandards particularly in the areas of particle reduction, automation and wafer size.\nNumerous customers with innovative applications have already chosen this system.\n6\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe outstanding performance and high level of maturity of our systems are arguments for\nmany of our customers to choose AIXTRON technology: in many segments, AIXTRON plays\na key role in the production of compound semiconductors in large volumes. However, our\nglobal customer service, which we have further expanded in a targeted manner in 2023, is\nat least just as important for our customers. Our engineers and technicians not only\nsupport customers with installation, commissioning and process start-up: they also advise\nthem on how to achieve the best possible results with our systems and help to further\nincrease operational productivity. This was also officially recognized by our customers: in\n2023 we received Supplier Excellence Awards from several major semiconductor\nproducers, including Texas Instruments and tsmc.\nIn addition to the sales achieved, these awards are another indication of AIXTRON's\nsuccessful strategy and orientation: We grew from being a specialist provider into a key\npartner in the modern semiconductor industry. In recent years, we have steadily\nincreased the company's level of maturity in all areas, from quality to production to\nservice. At the same time, we have optimized our internal structures and processes to\nachieve scalability for further growth.\nTogether with our technology partners, we are already working on the innovations and\nproducts of tomorrow today. We have laid an important foundation for this with the\ndecision to build the new innovation center at our headquarters in Herzogenrath in 2023.\nWe are expanding the current clean room with a new building by 1,000 m2 of space in\nclass ISO 6, expandable up to ISO 4, and creating additional office space for a further 100\nemployees. The investment of around EUR 100 million gives us space for our next product\ngenerations, to develop technologies with customers and partners and to develop new\napplications. The construction project is progressing at lightning speed and is fully on\nschedule at the time of reporting: after the final construction decision in May 2023, all\npermits were received in August 2023, and the floor slab of the main building was\ncompleted at the turn of the year.\nAIXTRON's extensive growth is supported by our talented workforce, which we further\nstrengthened in 2023. It forms the backbone of our success. Only with their tireless\ncommitment, their belief in our strategy and vision, their creativity and performance\nwere we able to secure and further expand our position as a global market leader. In a\nmarket environment with great competition in the search for talented employees, we\nmanaged to recruit a further round 200 employees worldwide, so that we had 1,086\ncolleagues at AIXTRON at the end of the year: AIXTRON offers extremely exciting tasks\nand content, but also a modern working environment and a very good working\natmosphere.\n7\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nOur Executive Board Members Dr. Felix Grawert and Dr. Christian Danninger (from left to right).\nAn important element for our growth is our close, cooperative collaboration with our\nsuppliers and business partners, whom we involve early on in new projects and with\nwhom we share the foresight in the supply chain in the medium to long term. Strong\ngrowth in a multi-level supply chain requires transparency, trust and reliability between\nthe partners involved. We were only able to cope with growth in 2023 with reliable\nsuppliers who can deliver because we have further intensified cooperation and\ncommunication along the supply chain. Despite challenging conditions, we were able to\nachieve top performance in terms of quality, delivery quantities and delivery reliability.\nWe would like to expressly thank all suppliers and business partners for this.\nIn the many projects in 2023, we were always advised and supported by our supervisory\nboard in a trusting collaboration. A big thank you for that. We would then like to thank\nyou, our shareholders, for your trust in us to lead AIXTRON into a successful future with\neconomically and ecologically sustainable growth.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE\nDr. Felix Grawert Dr. Christian Danninger\nChairman Member\n8\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nSupervisory Board Report\nThe 2023 financial year was very successful for AIXTRON. Order intake, sales and profits\nincreased significantly despite a challenging environment, which was also due to the\nintroduction of the new product generation, the G10 product family. With this product\nportfolio, AIXTRON will be able to defend or further expand its strong market position in\nthe targeted markets. The Supervisory Board will continue to support the implementation\nof this corporate strategy pursued by the Executive Board.\nThe growth markets for compound semiconductors addressed by AIXTRON all developed\nvery positively and enabled the company to benefit from this development with its\nleading technologies. AIXTRON has also made great progress in recruiting new employees\nto strengthen the company structures with a view to further growth. Through targeted\ninvestments in research and development, AIXTRON creates the foundations for future\nsuccess – in the short and long term. The investment in the planned new innovation\ncenter will support this objective.\nThe areas of environmental, social and societal aspects as well as responsible corporate\nmanagement (environmental, social, governance; ESG) remain the company's focus. It is\nimportant to comply with the regulatory changes and at the same time to promote\nfurther improvements in all aspects of sustainability.\nDuring the entire reporting year, the Supervisory Board fully performed the tasks\nincumbent upon it in accordance with the law, the articles of association and the rules of\nprocedure, and the training and further education measures of the Supervisory Board\nmembers were adequately supported by the company.\nCooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored the Executive Board in its management of\nthe Company and advised it on all matters of importance to the Company, so that the\nSupervisory Board was always able to verify the legality and regularity, expediency, and\neconomic efficiency of the Company’s management.\nThe Supervisory Board was directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of\nfundamental importance to the Company. The Executive Board informed the Supervisory\nBoard regularly, promptly, and comprehensively about the course of business, market\ndevelopment, corporate planning, and the strategic development of the AIXTRON Group.\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board regularly consulted with the Executive Board on the\nCompany’s risk situation, risk management, and compliance. Particular attention was paid\nto the areas of information security and ESG, about which the Executive Board also\nprovided the Supervisory Board with comprehensive information. Based on the Executive\nBoard’s reports, business developments and other events of importance to the Company\nwere discussed in detail. The Supervisory Board approved the respective resolution\nproposals of the Executive Board after thorough examination and consultation.\n9\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe Supervisory Board did not make use of the opportunity to review the Company's\nbooks and records (Section 111 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)).\nCooperation with the Executive Board was characterized in every aspect by responsible\nand targeted action. The Executive Board fully complied with its reporting obligations to\nthe Supervisory Board, both verbally and in writing.\nThe Executive Board supports the members of the Supervisory Board to an appropriate\nextent in the training and continuing education measures they are generally responsible\nfor. In addition, the Company provides the members with up-to-date, topic-specific\ninformation material in order to keep them informed about current market trends in the\nsemiconductor industry and important capital market issues. In addition, AIXTRON\nsupports participation in further training events relevant to Supervisory Board activities.\nNew Supervisory Board members are introduced to all relevant topics and processes in an\nonboarding program, in particular with comprehensive background information on the\ntechnologies and markets in which AIXTRON operates (recommendation D.11 German\nCorporate Governance Code 2022).\nAs Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I was also in regular contact with the Executive\nBoard even beyond the Supervisory Board meetings. In addition to the current business\nsituation and important business transactions, we discussed especially matters of\nstrategic positioning of the Company.\nSupervisory Board Meetings 2023\nThe Supervisory Board met for five regular meetings and one extraordinary meeting in\n2023. One meeting was held virtually, all other meetings were held face-to-face. Prof. Dr.\nDenk and Dr. Traeger were being excused absent for one meeting each. Prof. Dr. Weber\nexcused her absence for one meeting but submitted her votes for it.

In addition, the key audit matters to be mentioned in the\nauditor's report on the AIXTRON annual and consolidated financial statements 2023 were\ndiscussed with the auditor.\nThe Audit Committee consists of three members and met seven times in 2023 (February,\nApril, May, July, September, October and December), of which three meetings were held\nvirtually. Dr. Traeger was excused from one meeting. With this exception all meetings in\n2023 were attended by Prof. Dr. Weber and all acting members of the Audit Committee.\nAll resolutions were passed unanimously. For the quarterly financial statements as of\nMarch 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023 as well as half year financial statements as of\nJune 30, 2023, the Audit Committee held discussions with the auditors and accounting\nrepresentatives in each case and discussed the publication of the figures in detail with the\nExecutive Board.\n12\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nIn addition to the regular accounting and business development topics, the Audit\nCommittee also dealt with the following key issues:\n• Declaration and ongoing monitoring of the auditor's independence\n• Current and future regulatory requirements for financial and non-financial reporting,\nin particular preparation for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\n• Non-financial Group report (Sustainability Report), in particular the implementation\nof the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Directive\n• Implementation of the recommendations and suggestions from the German\nCorporate Governance Code (GCGC 2022)\n• Risk management, risk report and overall risk situation in accordance with auditing\nstandard IDW PS 340 n.F.\n• Adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system (ICS) and the risk\nmanagement system (RMS) and the internal audit system.\n• Compliance Management System (CMS) and its revision\n◦ Introduction of a tax compliance management system (tax CMS)\n◦ Introduction of a compliance program for the protection of human rights\nand the environment in AIXTRON's business area and supply chain, which\nis based on the German Supply Chain Duty of Care Act (LkSG), in order to\nbe prepared for a possible future mandatory application of the LkSG)\n◦ Implementation of the requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act\n(HinSchG)\n• Status of internal audits 2023 and possible measures and audit planning for the\nfollowing year\n• Data protection and Information security, esp. cyber security risks\n• Preparations for the introduction of an Information Security Management System\n(ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001\n• Tax audits, esp. at AIXTRON SE\n• Assessment of the quality of the audit of the financial statements\nThe Capital Market Committee is concerned with the evaluation of activities with\npotential capital market relevance. It consists of three members and is chaired by me, Mr.\nKim Schindelhauer. No meetings were held in 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Nomination Committee consisted of three members which is also\nchaired by me, Kim Schindelhauer. The committee makes appropriate proposals to the\nfull Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to the corporate bodies. In doing\nso, it also considers the targets for the composition of the corporate bodies. During 2023,\na total of nine meetings was held (January, February, June, twice in July, twice in\nSeptember, twice in October), thereof eight meetings were held virtually. All meetings\nwere attended by all members. In the search for suitable candidates for the Supervisory\n13\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nBoard, a suitable personnel consultant was first selected and commissioned, which was\nunanimously approved by the Supervisory Board. The list of candidates was then\ndiscussed and two personalities were selected to be proposed to the 2024 Annual\nGeneral Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board. The Nomination Committee also\ndealt with the rules of procedure for an Executive Committee to be formed, for which the\nExecutive Board has proposed suitable candidates. The committee recommended that\nthe Supervisory Board approve the rules of procedure. In addition, the Nomination\nCommittee, in cooperation with the Remuneration Committee, dealt with the extension\nof the service contract for the Executive Board member Dr. Danninger. The committee\nrecommended to the Supervisory Board that the contract be extended and requested\nthat it be prepared accordingly.\nThe Compensation Committee mainly deals with issues relating to the remuneration of\nthe Executive Board members, in particular its variable short-term and long-term\nremuneration components. In the course of revising the remuneration system for the\nExecutive Board, an intensive dialogue was held and a corresponding proposal is to be\ndrawn up in cooperation with the Nomination Committee, which is to be submitted to the\nshareholders for approval at the upcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting. The\nremuneration of the Supervisory Board was also discussed, for which a benchmark\ncomparison is to be drawn up. Based on this, the Remuneration Committee, in\ncollaboration with the Nomination Committee, is to draw up a corresponding proposal to\nbe submitted to shareholders for approval at the upcoming 2024 Annual General\nMeeting.\nCorporate Governance and Declaration of Conformity\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitors the development of corporate governance\nstandards and prepares a joint corporate governance report together with the Executive\nBoard. The Supervisory Board will continue to support the Executive Board in its efforts to\nfully comply with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code\n(“GCGC”).\nIn the current Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock\nCorporation Act (AktG) dated February 2024, full compliance with the recommendations\nof the German Corporate Governance Code is declared, except for one deviation\nexplained.\nNo conflicts of interest involving members of the Supervisory Board or Executive Board\nwere reported in the fiscal year.\nAudit, Annual Financial Statements and Non-Financial Report\nIn accordance with the resolution of the general shareholders meeting on May 17, 2023,\nthe Supervisory Board commissioned KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Essen,\nGermany with the audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial\nstatements as well as the combined management report of AIXTRON SE for fiscal year\n2023. The audit was performed by the audit team of the lead auditor Dr. Kathryn\nAckermann.\n14\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe audits also covered the measures taken by the Executive Board to identify risks at an\nearly stage that could threaten the success and continued existence of the Company. It\nwas also agreed that the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board or make a note in the\naudit report if, during the performance of the audit, it ascertains facts that show a\nmisstatement in the Declaration of Conformity issued by the Executive Board and\nSupervisory Board in accordance with Section 161 of the AktG. As in previous years, such\na determination was not necessary for the 2023 fiscal year.\nThe annual financial statements and the combined management report of AIXTRON SE\nand the AIXTRON Group as of December 31, 2023, were prepared in accordance with the\nrules of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements and\nthe group management report as of December 31, 2023, were prepared in accordance\nwith Section 315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards\nIFRS. The independent auditing Company KPMG AG audited the annual financial\nstatements and the consolidated financial statements and combined management report\nprepared by AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2023 and has reviewed the separate non-financial\nreport of the group. The financial statements including the combined management report\nwere issued with an unqualified audit opinion. The non-financial consolidated report\nreceived the note on an audit to obtain limited assurance. The auditors found that the\ncombined management report of the Company and the Group accurately presents the\ncurrent business and future development of the Company and the Group.\nThe financial statement documents (annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE and\nconsolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, as well as the combined\nmanagement report of AIXTRON SE and the Group), the proposal for the appropriation of\nprofits, the separate Group non-financial report as well as the auditor's reports were\nsubmitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a timely manner. These\ndocuments were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board. In the meeting of the Audit\nCommittee and the full Supervisory Board on February 26, 2024, both the annual financial\nstatements of AIXTRON SE and the consolidated financial statements as well as the\ncombined management report and the Group non-financial report were discussed and\ndebated in detail, considering the audit reports of the auditor. The auditor, who attended\nboth the Audit Committee meeting and the Supervisory Board meeting, reported on the\nmain results of its audit, which also included the internal control and risk management\nsystem regarding the accounting process, and was available to the Audit Committee and\nthe Supervisory Board, respectively, for any additional questions and information.\nThe results of our own review did not give rise to any objections either to the Group non-\nfinancial report or to the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial\nstatements and the combined management report.

One\nmeeting was held with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in the past financial year.\nThe topics discussed were succession planning on the Supervisory Board, diversity and\nExecutive Board remuneration.\n30\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs of December 31, 2023, the composition of the Supervisory Board in accordance with\nthe Articles of Association and as determined by the Annual General Meeting was as\nfollows:\nComposition of the Supervisory Board\n(as of December 31, 2023)\nName Position Member since End of term\nChairman of the Supervisory\nBoard, Chairman of the Capital\nKim Schindelhauer1)2)3)4)5) Market Committee 2002 HV 2026\nDeputy Chairman of the\nSupervisory Board, Chairman of\nthe Remuneration and\nFrits van Hout 4) Nomination Committee 2019 HV 2024\nProf. Dr. Andreas Biagosch2)3) 2013 HV 2024\nProf. Dr. Petra Denk4) 2011 HV 2024\nDr. Stefan Traeger1)2)3)4) 2022 HV 2025\nChairwoman of the Audit\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber 1) Committee 2019 HV 2024\n1) Member of the Audit Committee\n2) Member of the Capital Market Committee\n3) Member of the Nomination Committee\n4) Member of the Remuneration Committee\n5) Former AIXTRON Executive Board member\nComposition of Committees\n(as of December 31, 2023)\nAudit Capital Market Nomination Remuneration\nCommittee Committee Committee Committee\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber Kim Schindelhauer Kim Schindelhauer Frits van Hout\n(Chairwoman) (Chairman) (Chairman) (Chairman)\nProf. Dr. Andreas Prof. Dr. Andreas\nKim Schindelhauer Biagosch Biagosch Prof. Dr. Petra Denk\nDr. Stefan Traeger Dr. Stefan Traeger Dr. Stefan Traeger Kim Schindelhauer\nDr. Stefan Traeger\n31\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIndependence of Supervisory Board Members and Cooperation between the\nSupervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board shall comprise what it considers to be a sufficient number of\nindependent members (recommendation C.6 GCGC). Accordingly, the Supervisory Board\nhas set itself the goal that more than half of its members shall be independent\n(recommendation C.7 GCGC). The Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall be\nindependent of the Company and the Executive Board (recommendation C.10 GCGC).\nAIXTRON considers Mr. Schindelhauer to be independent despite the long period of time\nhe has been a member of the Supervisory Board. During his time as Chairman of the\nSupervisory Board, Mr. Schindelhauer has always maintained a professional distance from\nthe Company and the Executive Board and has fulfilled his monitoring and advisory duties\nby applying an appropriate critical attitude at all times (recommendation C.8 GCGC).\nAs all members of the Supervisory Board, which consists exclusively of elected\nshareholder representatives, are therefore to be regarded as independent, this\nrecommendation is also met.\nThe Supervisory Board includes Mr. Schindelhauer, a former member of the Executive\nBoard, whose term of office as a member of the Executive Board, however, was more\nthan two years ago (see also C.7 GCGC). The Supervisory Board therefore complies with\nrecommendation C.11 of the GCGC that it shall not include more than two former\nmembers of the Executive Board.\nThe Supervisory Board must include at least one member with expertise in the field of\nauditing and at least one other member with expertise in the field of accounting. These\nrequirements are met by the two members, Prof. Dr. Weber and Mr. Schindelhauer.\nAhead of the Supervisory Board meeting in December 2023, the members of the\nSupervisory Board completed a self-evaluation questionnaire. After evaluation of the\nquestionnaire, the Supervisory Board determined that the Supervisory Board performs its\nactivities effectively in accordance with recommendation D.12 of the GCGC.\nFurther mandates of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are\nlisted in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in section 36 Supervisory\nBoard and Executive Board.\nThe Company did not enter into or carry out any material transactions with any related\nparties in the fiscal year 2023.\nThe Audit Committee is chaired by Prof. Dr. Weber, an independent and expert member\nof the Supervisory Board in accordance with recommendation D.3 GCGC. She is not the\nsame person as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In the persons of Prof. Dr. Weber\nand Mr. Schindelhauer, the Audit Committee includes one member with expertise in the\nfield of auditing and one further member with expertise in the field of accounting.\nThe Supervisory Board regularly holds four ordinary meetings and the Audit Committee\nseven ordinary meetings per calendar year. Extraordinary Supervisory Board meetings as\nwell as meetings of the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration, and Capital Market\nCommittees are convened as required.\n32\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Executive Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board and its committees on the\ncompany's situation. At the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, or the\nChairpersons of the Committees, the Executive Board regularly attends the ordinary\nmeetings of the Supervisory Board or individual committee meetings, reports in writing\nand orally on the individual agenda items and draft resolutions, and answers the\nquestions of individual Supervisory Board members. Between meetings, all members of\nthe Supervisory Board receive detailed quarterly reports from the Executive Board on the\nsituation of the Company. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the\nChairwoman of the Audit Committee are informed by the Executive Board about\nimportant developments and upcoming important decisions in telephone calls and\npersonal discussions. In accordance with recommendation D.6 GCGC, meetings are also\nheld without participation of the Executive Board.\nAs a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board and its committees are passed at the\nmeetings. In justified exceptional cases, Supervisory Board members may also participate\nin a meeting of the Supervisory Board or a committee by telephone or video conference.\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees each constitute a quorum if two thirds of the\nmembers participate in the vote (outside of meetings by means of a vote conducted in\nwriting, by fax, by telephone or by e-mail, or by a combination of the aforementioned\ncommunication media, provided that no member of the Supervisory Board objects to this\nprocedure). Resolutions require a simple majority of the votes cast. In the event of a tie,\nthe chairman of the meeting has the casting vote.\nEach member of the Supervisory Board shall disclose to the Supervisory Board any\nconflicts of interest, in particular those that may arise as a result of a consultancy or\ndirectorship function with customers, suppliers, lenders or other third parties. Any\nconflicts of interest on the part of a member of the Supervisory Board that are material\nand not merely temporary shall result in that person having to resign from office.\nSelf-evaluation of the Supervisory Board\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-evaluation based on\na questionnaire, taking into account AIXTRON-specific criteria. The results were discussed\nby the Supervisory Board and confirmed that cooperation both within the Supervisory\nBoard and with the Executive Board was characterized by a high degree of trust and\nopenness. The Supervisory Board and its committees were also considered to be\nadequately informed and effective in their work. Hence there is no fundamental need for\nchange. Based on the feedback received, the Remuneration Committee was asked to\ndraw up a proposal for adjusting the remuneration of the Supervisory Board.\n33\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation on the Equal Representation of Men and Women as per\nSection 76 para. 4 and Section 111 para. 5 AktG\nPursuant to Sections 76 para. 4, 111 para. 5 AktG, companies listed on the stock exchange\nor subject to co-determination must set target figures for the proportion of women on\ntheir supervisory boards, executive boards and the two management levels below the\nexecutive board. The GCGC reflects these regulations in principle 3 and principle 9\nsentence 2 for the executive board and in recommendation C.1 sentence 2 for the\nsupervisory board.\nAIXTRON aims to increase both the proportion of women and the internationality of its\nemployees and managers. In doing so, the Company is primarily committed to the\nprofessional and social skills of all employees.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has set the following target figures for the\nproportion of women to be reached by December 31, 2025:\nTarget as of Women’s quota\nLevel 31.12.2025 as of 31.12.2023 Determined by\nSupervisory Board 33% 33% Supervisory Board\nExecutive Board 0% 0% Supervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board consists of six members. It continues to include two women,\nbringing the proportion of female Supervisory Board members to around 33% as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The current composition of the Executive Board is in line with the\ntarget set for the Executive Board.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE has set itself the objective of specifically promoting\nwomen in the Company. In line with this objective, the Executive Board has now raised\nthe targets for the proportion of women to 10% for the first level below the Executive\nBoard and to 20% for the second level below the Executive Board. These targets are to be\nachieved by December 31, 2025.\nTarget as of Women’s quota\nLevel 31.12.2025 as of 31.12.2023 Determined by\n1st tier management 10% 11% Executive Board\n2nd tier management 20% 23% Executive Board\nBased on the current composition of the Executive Board, no changes in the composition\nare initially planned until the end of 2025, so that the target for the proportion of women\non the Executive Board valid until December 31, 2025 has been set at 0%. The proportion\nof women at all management levels should be increased in the long term. To this end, the\nExecutive Board has rolled out various personnel development initiatives that promote\nthe advancement of female talent at AIXTRON. These include, for example, coaching and\nmentoring programs for selected female managers. In addition, there were regular\nwomen’s network meetings in 2023, which enabled participants to share their views on\nstrategic corporate management topics. In order to ensure equal participation of women\nin management positions, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of AIXTRON SE are\nfocusing even more on women when evaluating job candidates.\n34\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDiversity Concept for Executive Board and Supervisory Board;\nObjectives for the Composition of the Supervisory Board and Status\nof Implementation\nExecutive Board\nAs required by the GCGC, AIXTRON has addressed the issue of objectives with regard to\nan appropriate level of diversity in the Company’s management (recommendations B.1\nand C.1).\nWhen proposing the appointment of new Executive Board members by the Nomination\nCommittee, the Supervisory Board takes into account their personal and professional\nsuitability, international experience and leadership qualities, the age limit set for\nmembers of the Executive Board, and diversity – also with regard to aspects such as age,\ngender, and educational and professional background. The Executive Board shall consist\nof members with different, complementary skill profiles as well as a sufficient age mix and\npossess different personalities. In addition to the above-mentioned qualities, members of\nthe Executive Board should, as far as possible, have different knowledge and experience\nas well as educational and professional backgrounds, both individually and in their\nentirety as a team. In view of the Company's international orientation, experience abroad\nis an advantage. In its search for suitable candidates to fill vacant positions on the\nExecutive Board, the Supervisory Board took account of the diversity concept and, as part\nof this, also considered female candidates.\nSupervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board has set the target for the proportion of women on the Supervisory\nBoard at 33% by December 31, 2025. With Prof. Dr. Petra Denk and Prof. Dr. Anna Weber,\ntwo of the six members of the Supervisory Board are currently women, corresponding to\na proportion of around 33%.\nThe targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board are shown in detail below:\n• When proposing candidates for election to the Supervisory Board, the Nomination\nCommittee ensures that the Supervisory Board always includes members who,\nindividually and collectively as a team, have the knowledge, skills and professional\nexperience required to properly perform their duties. Furthermore, the members\nshould be independent. In this way, the Nomination Committee contributes to\nincreasing the efficiency and transparency of the selection process. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Board members should be elected for the longest period of time\npermitted by the statutes.\n35\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n• AIXTRON is strongly export-oriented. In particular, experience in AIXTRON’s specific\nelectronics and semiconductor markets is a great advantage.\n• As a general rule, an age limit of 75 years for the retirement of Supervisory Board\nmembers should be appropriate. New Supervisory Board members should be\navailable to the Company for at least two election periods.\n• It is desirable that the individual members of the Supervisory Board have the most\ndiverse education, qualifications, expertise and international experience possible in\norder to have the knowledge, skills and professional experience necessary to\nproperly perform their duties. Company- and product-oriented coverage with an\nunderstanding of the business model, the industry-specific features and the\nprocesses in the various areas of business administration, accounting, auditing,\ncorporate development, capital markets, technology, special equipment\nmanufacturing, markets/sales, semiconductor market etc. are advantageous.\n• It is in the best interests of the Company to utilize the potential of well-trained and\nmotivated employees of different nationalities and genders. The Supervisory Board\nsupports the appropriate participation of women and men on the Supervisory Board,\nwhich is reflected in the current proportion of women on the Supervisory Board of\naround 33%.\n• In its opinion, the Supervisory Board should have a sufficient number of independent\nmembers, whereby a member of the Supervisory Board shall not be considered\nindependent in particular if he or she has a business or personal relationship with\nthe Company, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or a company affiliated\nwith the latter that could give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of\ninterest.\n• More than half of the Supervisory Board shall consist of independent members.\n• No more than two former members of the Executive Board shall be members of the\nSupervisory Board.\n• The members of the Supervisory Board shall not exercise any executive or advisory\nfunctions at major competitors of the Company.\n• At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of\naccounting and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have\nexpertise in the field of auditing. These two members shall then also be members of\nthe Audit Committee.\n• Due to the increased demands on the professionalization of the Supervisory Board’s\nmembers and in order to simultaneously ensure high efficiency of the Supervisory\nBoard’s activities as in previous years, new Supervisory Board members shall not\nhold more than five mandates in other listed companies or other companies that\nhave comparable requirements, whereby a supervisory board chairmanship counts\ndouble.\nIn addition to the objectives set for its composition, the Supervisory Board has also drawn\nup a skills profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole. In view of AIXTRON’s business\nactivities and the markets addressed by the Company, the Supervisory Board shall have\nexpertise in the areas of technology, finance/accounting, capital markets, strategy and\n36\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\ncorporate governance, and in ecological sustainability topics of relevance to AIXTRON SE.\nFurthermore, a established network of contacts and many years of experience in the\nrespective disciplines are advantageous.\nThe requirement for diversity within the Supervisory Board (recommendation C.1\nsentence 2 GCGC ) is fulfilled, among other things, as a result of the diverse skills of the\nindividual Supervisory Board members (with regard to areas such as finance, capital\nmarkets, M&A, and technology and markets).\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE are convinced that the\ncomposition of the Supervisory Board fully complies with its own objectives and skills\nprofile as well as with the requirement of the current GCGC for appropriate diversity and\nan appropriate number of independent Supervisory Board members.\nAs Chairwoman of the Audit Committee of AIXTRON SE, Prof. Dr. Anna Weber has\nexpertise in the field of accounting and auditing. She is an auditor and a member of the\nSupervisory Board and Chairwoman of the Audit Committee of another listed company.\nShe is also a professor of general business administration specializing in external\naccounting. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Mr. Kim Schindelhauer, also has\nexpertise in the field of accounting. He was active at AIXTRON as Chief Executive Officer,\nChief Financial Officer and Commercial Director as well as in various management\npositions in the finance department of other international groups (recommendation D.3\nGCGC).\nIn the following qualification matrix (recommendation C.1 GCGC), the Supervisory Board\npresents a clear overview of the implementation status of the desired skills profile for the\nSupervisory Board as a whole:\n37\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nProf. Dr.\nKim Frits van Prof. Dr. Dr. Stefan Prof. Dr.\nAndreas\nSchindelhauer Hout Petra Denk Traeger Anna Weber\nBiagosch\nMembership\nduration\nMember since 2002 2019 2013 2011 2022 2019\nGeneral suitability\nIndependence 1) + + + + + +\nNo overboarding + + + + + +\nDiversity\nYear of birth 1953 1960 1955 1972 1967 1984\nGender m m m f m f\nNationality German Dutch German German German German\nInternational\n+ + + + +\nexperience\nMechanical Physics and Physics and\nBusiness Engineering Business Business Business\nEducational\nAdmini- Physics and Business Admini- Admini- Admini-\nbackground\nstration Admini- stration stration stration\nstration (EBW) (MBA)\nProfessional\nknowledge 2)\nCompany\nmanagement 3) + + + +\nStrategy + + + + +\nSales & marketing + + +\nOperations & Supply\n+ + + +\nChain\nDigitalization of\nbusiness models\n+ + +\nrelated to capital\ngoods\nPersonnel / HR + + + + + +\nCapital market / IR + + +\nAccounting + +\nAuditing + +\nLegal / Compliance /\nCorporate + + + +\nGovernance\nSustainability / ESG + + + +\nGeopolitics + + + +\nEntrepreneurship &\n+ + + + +\nValue Creation\nKnowledge of\ntechnologies\nSemiconductor\n(equipment) + + + + +\nindustry\nCompound\n+ + + +\nsemiconductors\nKnowledge of\ncustomer industry\nPower electronics + +\nOptoelectronics + +\nDisplay industry + +\n1) In accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code\n2) Criterion met (+), based on self-assessment by Supervisory Board member\n3) Experience as Executive Board member of capital market-oriented companies of similar complexity or comparable\nexperience\n38\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation on the Remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\nand on the Remuneration System of the Executive Board\nDetailed information on the structure and amount of remuneration paid to the individual\nExecutive Board members and on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory\nBoard as well as an exact list of the outstanding Executive Board stock options can be\nfound in the Company’s Remuneration Report.\nThe remuneration system pursuant to Section 87a para. 1 and para. 2, sentence 1 AktG\napproved by the 2020 Annual General Meeting with an approval rate of 90.3% is publicly\navailable on the Company's website under Executive Board Remuneration Policy.

The remuneration of the individual\nmembers of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is disclosed on an individual\nbasis. The remuneration report for fiscal year 2022 was approved by the Annual General\nMeeting on May 17, 2023.\nThis report complies with the requirements of the Act Implementing the Second\nShareholders' Directive (ARUG II) pursuant to Section 162 of the German Stock\nCorporation Act (AktG). For reasons of easier readability, we only use the grammatical\nmasculine form here. It represents people of all genders: male, female, diverse.\nPrinciples of the Remuneration System\nThe remuneration system for the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE was introduced in 2020.\nIt is in line with the content-related requirements of ARUG II and is based on the\nrecommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April\n28, 2022. A detailed description of the remuneration system for the Executive Board\nwhich was approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020 can be found on\nthe AIXTRON SE website under Executive Board remuneration system.\nThe remuneration system for the 2023 fiscal year applies to the contracts of the Executive\nBoard members Dr. Felix Grawert and Dr. Christian Danninger for the period from January\n1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and of Dr. Jochen Linck for the period from January 1, 2023\nto September 30, 2023. The structure of the remuneration of the Executive Board at\nAIXTRON SE is designed to provide incentives for ecologically and economically\nsustainable development of the Company as well as for long-term commitment by\nExecutive Board members.\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the specific\nremuneration of the individual members of the Executive Board. Within the scope of\nwhat is legally permissible, the Supervisory Board targets to offer the members of the\nExecutive Board a remuneration scheme that is customary in the market and at the same\ntime competitive in order to be able to attract outstanding personalities to AIXTRON SE\nand retain them in the long term.\nOn the basis of the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board sets a target for the total\nremuneration for each Executive Board member for the upcoming fiscal year, which\nconsists of three components:\n• fixed remuneration,\n• short-term performance-related variable remuneration (short-term incentive, STI),\nand\n• long-term performance-related variable remuneration (long-term incentive, LTI).\n41\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration Structure\nFixed remuneration consists of fixed, non-performance-related base remuneration,\nwhich is paid out as a monthly salary. Other components of fixed remuneration include\nfringe benefits, such as a company car, allowances for individual private pensions, and the\nassumption of costs for other insurance policies.\nThe variable remuneration is directly linked to the strategy and the performance of the\nAIXTRON Group and consists of the short-term STI and the long-term LTI. The amount of\nthe two variable remuneration elements depends on the achievement of financial and\nnon-financial performance criteria. In the interests of the shareholders, the company\ndoes not publish the details of individual market-related KPIs that could allow\ncompetitors to draw conclusions about the strategic intentions of the company. The\nweighting and KPI value of each target are determined before the beginning of each fiscal\nyear by the Supervisory Board and the result is solely determined by the actual KPI\nachievement without any discretionary adjustments.\nShort-term Performance-Related Variable Remuneration\nThe short-term, performance-related remuneration Short Term Incentive (STI) is based\non the performance achieved by the AIXTRON Group in the fiscal year and is granted\nentirely in cash.\nThe STI is measured based on the key indicators of consolidated net income, the market\nposition of the AIXTRON Group and financial and operational targets. The relative\nweighting is 70% for the consolidated net income, 15% for the market position and 15%\nfor financial and operational goals.\n42\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nShort-term Variable Remuneration (STI)\nThe targets are set prior to the start of a fiscal year: The Supervisory Board establishes\nthe STI‘s target value and the targets based on the aforementioned indicators. In the\nevent of 100% target achievement, the individual target STI of the Executive Board\nmembers varies from 1.1% to 1.75% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant\nto the budget approved by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year.\nSTI target achievement is determined after the expiry of the fiscal year. This is capped at\na maximum of 250% target achievement. No STI is paid if the consolidated net income for\nthe year is negative, i.e. in years in which the Company posts a loss. STI is paid out in cash\nafter the Supervisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term Performance-Related Variable Remuneration (LTI)\nThe amount of long-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the\nlong- term incentive (LTI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group over a 3-\nyear reference period and is granted entirely in AIXTRON shares. Executive Board\nmembers may first dispose of these shares following a four-year holding period calculated\nfrom the start of the reference period.\nBefore the start of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets\nfor each Executive Board member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive\nBoard member receives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI, which\nvaries from 1.4% to 2.25% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the\nbudget adopted by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year. The number of forfeitable\nstock awards is calculated based on the average of the closing prices on all stock market\ntrading days in the final quarter of the previous year. If consolidated net income for the\nyear is budgeted to be zero or negative, and if a return to profitability is expected during\nthe reference period, the Supervisory Board may within reasonable limits specify a LTI\nvalue for the fiscal year.\n43\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for\nthe year and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. In this regard,\nthe relative weighting amounts to 50% for consolidated net income for the year, 40% for\nTSR, and 10% for sustainability targets.\nFor the first LTI key figure, the consolidated net income for the year, before the start of\neach fiscal year the Supervisory Board sets a target value on the aggregate consolidated\nnet incomes that are to be achieved during the reference period. After the reference\nperiod ends, the ratio of the actual value to the target value is calculated. If the two\nvalues are identical, target achievement amounts to 100%. Target achievement is capped\nat a maximum of 250%. If the ratio is zero or negative, target achievement amounts to\n0%. A linear interpolation takes place between the values of 0% and 250%. The second LTI\nkey figure, the TSR, denotes the total shareholder return over the reference period and\nis calculated as the ratio of the change in the stock price, plus paid dividends, at the end\nof the reference period to the value at the start of the reference period. The TSR for\nAIXTRON stock is determined by the weighted TSR for a comparative group, which\nconsists of the shares of six semiconductor equipment manufacturers – Veeco\nInstruments, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, ASML, and ASMI – and is\nweighted in proportion to their market capitalization. Changes in the share prices are\ndetermined by reference to the difference between the average values of the closing\nprices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter before the start of the\nreference period and in the final quarter of the reference period. After the reference\nperiod ends, the ratio of the development in the TSR for AIXTRON shares to the\ndevelopment in the TSR for the comparative group is calculated. The target achievement\nover the reference period corresponds to the ratio of the TSR performance of the\nAIXTRON share to the TSR performance of the peer group. Target achievement is capped\nat a maximum of 250% and amounts to 0% if the ratio is less than 50%. If during the\nperiod under consideration the enterprises in the comparative group experience\nextraordinary changes (such as mergers, changes in business activities, etc.), the\nSupervisory Board may take this appropriately into consideration with regard to the\ncomposition of the comparative group. In such case, the Supervisory Board will report on\nthis in the annual remuneration report.\n44\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe third LTI key figure is calculated by reference to sustainability targets set by the\nSupervisory Board at the start of each reference period. These targets refer to the areas\nof environment, social affairs, and corporate governance. Target achievement\ncorresponds to the ratio of the actual values to the target values and is capped at 250%.\nBefore the start of each fiscal year, the Supervisory Board sets two to three sustainability\ntargets that are to be achieved by the end of the reference period. The sustainability\ntargets that the Supervisory Board may choose from before the start of a fiscal year when\nsetting targets for the respective Executive Board member include, among others:\nefficient use of energy and raw materials, reduction of emissions, employee satisfaction\nand development, customer satisfaction, innovation performance, successor planning,\nand compliance.\nAfter the expiry of the three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement\nis determined by the Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement,\nthe forfeitable stock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise\nlapse. The maximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection\nwith LTI is capped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start\nof the reference period.\nFollowing expiry of the four-year restriction period, the shares are transferred to the\nExecutive Board member, with due compliance with the maximum remuneration limits\nset out below. The Executive Board member is not entitled to receive dividends during\nthe restriction period.\nRemuneration limits\nThe remuneration system is intended to provide appropriate rewards for successful\nExecutive Board work and to ensure that the Executive Board and shareholders all benefit\nfrom the Company‘s positive development. At the same time, to prevent the taking of\ninappropriate risks and ensure an appropriate relation to the situation of the AIXTRON\nGroup, Executive Board remuneration is limited by setting a maximum remuneration and\na remuneration cap.\nMaximum remuneration (expenditure cap) is the total remuneration owed to the\nExecutive Board for a fiscal year. It may not exceed EUR 6,500 thousand in the case of two\nExecutive Board members or EUR 10,000 thousand in the case of three or more Executive\nBoard members. If an Executive Board contract ends during the financial year, the\nexpenditure cap is calculated on a pro rata basis. In total, this also results in the\nexpenditure cap, i.e. the maximum expense for the Company.\nThere is also a remuneration cap (allocation cap) for the aggregate of fixed\nremuneration, STI, and LTI. The actual allocation for each Executive Board member for a\nfiscal year is capped at four times the Executive Board member’s target total\nremuneration. This is the allocation cap. If the remuneration cap is exceeded, a portion of\nthe vested stock awards previously awarded is forfeited to ensure compliance.\nFixed remuneration will generally account for 20% to 40% of target total remuneration,\nwhile variable remuneration will make up 60% to 80%. Long-term remuneration will ac-\ncount for a greater share of remuneration in order to provide incentives for long-term\nand sustainable actions. No additional remuneration is paid for group-internal mandates\nat subsidiaries.\n45\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFurther Provisions\nTo ensure that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of\nshareholders, the Company has a stock ownership policy. Following a four-year build-up\nphase, each Executive Board member is obliged to hold AIXTRON stock worth 100% of\ntheir base remuneration on a permanent basis throughout their term of office. The value\nof vested stock awards is set off against the respective target shareholding value.\nExecutive Board members may sell shares only if they exceed the respective target value.\nFurthermore, a sanctioning mechanism, i.e. claw-back policy, applies for breaches of\nduty or compliance. Based on this mechanism, in the event of such breaches the\nSupervisory Board may reduce variable remuneration components not yet paid out, allow\nstock awards to lapse, or even claw these back. These possibilities may be exercised even\nwhen the Executive Board member is no longer in office and is no longer employed by the\nCompany.\nIn justified exceptional circumstances, such as severe economic crises, the effects of\nwhich render the original Company targets invalid, the Supervisory Board may resolve a\ntemporary divergence from the remuneration system if such divergence is in the interests\nof AIXTRON SE. As a general rule, the targets and target values do not change during the\nperiods relevant for the respective target achievement, even if developments in the\noverall market are unfavorable.\nComparison of Remuneration\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the appropriateness of the various components of\nremuneration on an annual basis. The remuneration system is presented to the Annual\nGeneral Meeting for approval in the event of any material changes to the system and at\nleast every four years.\nFor the purposes of external comparison, the Supervisory Board refers to remuneration\ndata at the semiconductor equipment manufacturers Veeco Instruments, Applied\nMaterials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, ASML, and ASMI, as well as to those companies\nlisted in the TecDAX that have a market capitalization between 50% and 200% of that of\nAIXTRON SE.\nFor the internal comparison, the Supervisory Board defines the senior management level\nas the ten non-tariff remunerated senior managers who have the greatest managerial\nresponsibility and decision-making powers.\nArrangements upon Contract Termination\nShould a contract with an Executive Board member be terminated, then the outstanding\nvariable remuneration components attributable to the time through to termination of the\ncontract will be paid out in accordance with the originally agreed targets and comparison\nparameters and with the due dates or holding periods specified in the contract. If an\nExecutive Board contract ends during a fiscal year, STI and LTI are granted on a prorated\nbasis relative to the length of service in this fiscal year.\n46\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe foregoing does not apply to cases in which the employment contract is terminated\nwithout notice for cause inherent in the Executive Board member for which he or she is\nresponsible. In such case, variable remuneration will not be paid for the year in which\ntermination becomes effective.\nIn the case of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate by reason of\nrevocation of the appointment, the Executive Board member will be paid a severance\nequal to the remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the remaining term\nof the employment contract, but not more than two years of remuneration (severance\ncap).\nWhen agreeing employment contracts with Executive Board members, the Supervisory\nBoard may stipulate that, in the event of the contract being terminated due to a “change-\nof-control” event, severance will be paid in the aforementioned maximum amount. A\nchange-of-control event in the foregoing sense exists where a third party, or a group of\nthird parties who combine their shareholding by contract in order to act as a single third\nparty, directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the Company’s share capital.\nBenefits in excess of this severance payment are not permitted.\nIn the event of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate based on mutual\nagreement to end the employment contract, the total value of benefits pledged by the\nCompany to the Executive Board member in connection with such agreement may not\nexceed the amount of remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the\noriginal remaining term of the employment contract and may not exceed a maximum of\ntwo annual remuneration packages.\n47\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Executive Board Members in Fiscal Year 2023\nIn fiscal year 2023, the remuneration system described above was applied to the\ncontracts of the Executive Board members Dr. Felix Grawert and Dr. Christian Danninger\nfor the period from January 1 to December 31 and of Dr. Jochen Linck for the period from\nJanuary 1 to September 30. The following sections specify the specific Executive Board\nremuneration for the reporting year and contain detailed information and background on\nthe total Executive Board remuneration, the target setting and target achievement of the\nvariable remuneration as well as individualized information on the remuneration of the\nindividual Executive Board members. The stated target remuneration takes into account\nthe departure of Executive Board members during the course of the year.\nTotal Remuneration\nThe maximum remuneration (expense cap) is the total remuneration owed to the\nExecutive Board for a financial year. It may not exceed EUR 6,500 thousand for two board\nmembers or EUR 10,000 thousand for three or more board members. For the 2023\nfinancial year, the maximum compensation (expense cap) may not exceed EUR 9,125\nthousand due to the departure of one member of the Executive Board during the year.\nThe total remuneration of the Executive Board for the fiscal year 2023 amounted to EUR\n9,125 thousand (2022: EUR 9,984 thousand). In the 2023 financial year, the expense cap\nwas applied, which limits the total compensation of the Executive Board to EUR 9,125\nthousand.\nThe non-performance-related fixed remuneration of the Executive Board for the fiscal\nyear 2023, consisting of a basic remuneration, pension allowances and benefits in kind,\ntotaled EUR 1,032 thousand (2022: EUR 1,113 thousand).\nBase Remuneration\nBase remuneration comprised the following amounts in fiscal year 2023:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 400 thousand\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 300 thousand\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 225 thousand\nPension Allowances\nThe Executive Board members in office in the year under report do not have individual\npension commitments, as a result of which no provisions are stated for pensions. The\nCompany rather pays pension allowances to Executive Board members together with\ntheir salaries or makes contributions to an insurance contract with a pension fund.\n48\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nPension allowances form a constituent component of the non-performance-related fixed\nremuneration of the Executive Board. They comprised the following amounts in fiscal\nyear 2023:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 30 thousand\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 30 thousand\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 23 thousand\nShort-term Variable Remuneration (STI)\nTarget Dimension “Consolidated Net Income for the Year”\nIn its meeting on December 12, 2022, the Supervisory Board set a target value of EUR\n141,691 thousand for the consolidated net income for 2023 (70% of total target). The\nactually achieved value of EUR 145,189 thousand results in a target achievement of 102%\n(2022: 115%).\nTarget Dimension “Market Position”\nFor the target dimension \"market position\" (15% of total target), the Supervisory Board\nhas set targets for individual market segments. These targets for the 2023 fiscal year are\nweighted 50% for existing markets and 50% for new growth markets. A good sales\nperformance in both the existing and the growth markets led to a target achievement of\n112% (2022: 175%) for the existing and 107% (2022: 234%) for the new markets.\nTarget Dimension “Financial and Operational Targets”\nFor the target dimension \"financial and operational targets\" (15% of total target),\nperformance criteria in the area of operational improvements and product-related\nimprovements were defined. Here, the target achievement in the past fiscal year was\n175% and 91% (2022: 142% for operational improvements and 50% for product-related\nimprovements).\nDue to the very good performance achieved in the 2023 financial year and the resulting\ntarget achievement, the expense cap applies, which limits the total compensation for the\nExecutive Board. This results in the short-term variable remuneration (STI) for fiscal year\n2023 as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 1,576 thousand in cash (reduced by 41.9% due to the\nexpense cap),\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 991 thousand in cash (reduced by 41.9% due to the\nexpense cap),\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 764 thousand in cash (reduced by 40.3% due to the\nexpense cap).\n49\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLong-Term Variable Remuneration (LTI)\nThe target achievement of the LTI tranche 2023 is calculated based on the results\nachieved in the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025. The following\nperformance criteria apply to them:\n• Consolidated net income for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025 (50% of total)\n• Change in total shareholder return (TSR) from Q4/2022 to Q4/2025 (40% of total)\n• Sustainability (10% of total):\n◦ Percentage of aligned sales, operating expenses (OpEx) and investments\n(CapEx) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2025\n◦ Strategic leadership team and personnel development, measured against\ndefined target quotas for the year 2025\nThe relevant AIXTRON SE share price for the LTI target remuneration for fiscal year 2023\nis EUR 28,206. It corresponds to the average of the XETRA closing prices on all stock\nexchange trading days in Q4/2022. The degree of achievement of the performance\ncriteria will be determined by the Supervisory Board after the end of fiscal year 2025. At\nthat time, the vested share awards will be converted into non-forfeitable share awards\ndepending on target achievement. After the expiry of a 4-year vesting period ending on\nDecember 31, 2026, for the fiscal year 2023, one share of the Company will be\ntransferred for each vested share award. This is to take place in the week following the\npublication of the annual report.\nFor the long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for 2023, the Supervisory Board stipulated\na target LTI of EUR 8.139 thousand was set for the Executive Board (without taking into\naccount the remuneration limits according to the remuneration system).\nIn the 2023 financial year, the expense cap will apply, which limits the total compensation\nof the Executive Board. This reduces the expense for long-term variable compensation\n(LTI) by 41.5% and limits it to a total of EUR 4.762 thousand.\nThis results in the following expenses for long-term variable remuneration (LTI):\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 2,266 thousand (reduced by 41.9% due to the expense\ncap)\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 1,410 thousand (reduced by 41.9% due to the\nexpense cap)\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 1,087 thousand (reduced by 40.3% due to the expense cap)\n50\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTabular Overview of Performance Criteria Applied to Executive Board Remuneration\npursuant to Sec. 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 1 Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\nInformation on the performance targets\nDescription of\nCompo- a) Minimum a) Target a) Measured\nperformance Portion\nnent target achievement performance\nmeasures\nb) Corresponding b) Corresponding b) Corresponding\nremuneration remuneration remuneration\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 102\nConsolidated net\n70%\nincome 2023\nkEUR b) 0 b) 3,645 b) 3,735\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 109\nMarket position 15%\nkEUR. b) 0 b) 781 b) 854\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 112\nExisting markets 50%\nkEUR b) 0 b) 391 b) 436\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 107\nSTI\nNew markets 50%\n2023\nkEUR b) 0 b) 391 b) 418\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 141\nFinancial and\n15%\noperational targets\nkEUR b) 0 b) 781 b) 1,105\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 175\nOperational\n70%\nimprovements\nkEUR b) 0 b) 469 b) 820\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 91\nProduct related\n30%\nimprovements\nkEUR b) 0 b) 312 b) 284\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nConsolidated net\n50% calculated at\nincome 2023-2025\nkEUR b) 0 b) 3,537 b) the end of 2025\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nTotal Shareholder\n40% calculated at\nReturn 2023-2025\nkEUR b) 0 b) 3,895 b) the end of 2025\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nLTI Sustainability\n10% calculated at\n2023 targets 2023-2025\nkEUR b) 0 b) 707 b) the end of 2025\nEU Taxonomy % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\naligned revenues, 50% calculated at\nOpEx and CapEx kEUR b) 0 b) 354 b) the end of 2025\nDevelopment of % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nexecutive and 50% calculated at\npersonnel kEUR b) 0 b) 354 b) the end of 2025\n51\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDetermination of Target Achievement Tranche 2021:\nThe reference period for the 2021 LTI tranche expired on December 31, 2023.

At the\nend of this fiscal year, the 'Total Shareholder Return' (TSR) performance of the AIXTRON share was\n184% compared to the TSR performance of the peer group 91%, corresponding to a target\nachievement of 149%. For the non-financial targets, the energy consumption of the AIXTRON Group\nnormalized for the number of systems, employees and laboratory runs was reduced by 15% in 2023\ncompared to the 2020 financial year. This corresponds to a target achievement of 249%.

The remuneration of the members\nof the Executive Board included in the table reflects the remuneration granted and due to\nthe respective Executive Board members in the reporting year and thus corresponds to\nthe value stated in the preceding remuneration tables in the column \"Remuneration\ngranted and due\" for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023 within the meaning of Section 162 (1)\nsentence 1 AktG. Where members of the Executive Board were only remunerated on a\npro rata basis in individual fiscal years, for example due to joining or leaving the company\nduring the year, the remuneration for this fiscal year was extrapolated to a full year to\nensure comparability.\nThe development of earnings is generally presented on the basis of the development of\nthe annual result of AIXTRON SE in accordance with Section 275 (3) No. 16 HGB (German\nCommercial Code). As the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board is also\nsignificantly dependent on the business success of the AIXTRON Group, the development\nof revenues, EBIT and net income for the year is also stated for the Group.\nThe comparison with the development of the average remuneration of employees is\nbased on the average remuneration of the workforce of the Group parent company\nAIXTRON SE in Germany. Since the employee and remuneration structures in the\nsubsidiaries are manifold, in particular in the case of employees abroad, it is appropriate\nfor the comparison of the development of the average remuneration to be based only on\nthe total workforce of AIXTRON SE. This comparison group was also used in the\nexamination of the appropriateness of the remuneration of the members of the Executive\nBoard. In this context, the remuneration of all employees of AIXTRON SE, including the\nleadership team and excluding student assistants, was taken into account. In order to\nensure comparability, the remuneration of part-time employees was extrapolated to full-\ntime equivalents.\n60\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nComparison of Annual Changes in Executive Board Remuneration\npursuant to Section 162 (1) no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n31.12.23 versus 31.12.22 versus 31.12.21 vs.\nAnnual change (in %) 31.12.22 31.12.21 31.12.20\nExecutive Board remuneration\nDr. Felix Grawert (2%) 18% 166%\nDr. Christian Danninger* (2%) 13% n.a.\nDr. Jochen Linck** 0% 18% 128%\nDr. Bernd Schulte*** n.a. n.a. 113%\nEarnings development of AIXTRON SE and\nthe Group\nGroup revenues 36% 8% 59%\nGroup EBIT 50% 6% 184%\nGroup net income 45% 6% 175%\nAIXTRON SE income 56% 6% 275%\nAverage remuneration of AIXTRON\nemployees****\nEmployees of AIXTRON SE 7% 3% 9%\n* Executive Board member since May 1, 2021, amount for 2021 calculated on an annualized basis\n** Executive Board member until September 30, 2023, amount for 2023 calculated on an annualized basis\n*** Executive Board member until March 31, 2021, amount for 2021 calculated on an annualized basis\n**** Based on full-time equivalents; gradual build-up over an observation period of five financial years\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board fell by around 2% in the 2023 financial year,\ndespite a significant increase in group sales (+36%), group EBIT (+50%) and group earnings\n(+45%). The reason for this is the application of the expense cap, which limits the total\ncompensation of the Executive Board.\nStock Option Plans\nThe remuneration system described does not include any stock options. Therefore,\nDr. Felix Grawert, Dr. Christian Danninger and Dr. Jochen Linck do not hold any stock\noptions.\nClaw-Back Information\nThere was no claw-back of variable compensation components of the Executive Board\nmembers in fiscal year 2023 (claw-back policy).\nOutlook for the Application of the Remuneration System for 2024\nShort-Term Variable Remuneration (STI)\nFor the current fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board has defined the following target\ndimensions and performance criteria for the short-term variable remuneration (STI) in\nDecember 2023:\n• Target dimension “Consolidated net income” (70% of total): The Supervisory Board\nset a target value for consolidated net income in 2024 in line with the internal\nforecast.\n61\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n• Target dimension “Market position” (15% of total): For the “Market position” target\ndimension, the Supervisory Board has set targets for important markets for 2024.\n• Target dimension “Financial and operational targets” (15% of total): Performance\ncriteria were defined for the target dimension “Financial and operational targets” in\nthe area of operational performance and product-related performance.\nLong-Term Variable Remuneration (LTI)\nThe Supervisory Board has defined the following performance criteria for the reference\nperiod for long-term variable remuneration (LTI) starting in fiscal year 2024:\n• Consolidated net income for fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026 (50% of total)\n• Development of total shareholder return (TSR) from Q4/2023 to Q4/2026 (40% of\ntotal).\n• Sustainability targets (10% of total)\n◦ Decarbonization goals according to the criteria of the Science-Based-\nTarget-Initiative (SBTi) and achieving “Target Approved” status until 2026.\n◦ Diversity and variety in the company, as well as employee retention, each\nmeasured until 2026 for a defined group of employees.\nThe target achievement of the LTI remuneration 2024 is calculated on the basis of the\nresults achieved in the period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2026. The relevant\nshare price of AIXTRON SE for the LTI grant is EUR 32.102. It corresponds to the average of\nthe XETRA closing prices on all stock exchange trading days in the 4th quarter of 2023. The\ndegree of fulfillment of the performance criteria will be determined by the Supervisory\nBoard after the end of fiscal year 2026. At that time, the vested share awards will be\nconverted into non-forfeitable share awards depending on target achievement. After the\nexpiry of a 4-year vesting period for fiscal year 2024 ending on December 31, 2027, one\nshare of the Company will be transferred for each vested share award. This is to take\nplace in the week following the publication of the annual report.\n62\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Supervisory Board Members\nRemuneration of the Supervisory Board is regulated in Article 17 of AIXTRON’s Articles of\nAssociation.

The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company at its own\nresponsibility while being advised and monitored by the Supervisory Board. In 2023, there\nwere the following personnel changes in the Company’s management and supervisory\nbodies:\nDr. Jochen Linck left the Executive Board on September 30, 2023. Since October 1, 2023,\nthe Executive Board has consisted of Dr. Felix Grawert (Chairman of the Board) and Dr.\nChristian Danninger (CFO).\nDetailed information on the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory\nBoard, the allocation of responsibilities between them, the operating procedures of the\nSupervisory Board committees and the Company‘s diversity concept can be found in the\nCorporate Governance Declaration, which is part of the annual report and also available\non the AIXTRON website at Declaration of Corporate Governance.1\n1 The information in the Corporate Governance Declaration was made in accordance with the requirements of the German\nCorporate Governance Code 2022. They are to be classified as \"not related to the Management Report\" because they go\nbeyond the legal requirements and are therefore not part of the substantive audit by the auditor.\n67\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nTechnology and Products\nThe AIXTRON product range includes customer-specific systems for the deposition of\ncomplex semiconductor materials. Here, substrates of different materials and sizes can be\ncoated.\nThe MOCVD process (Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) is used to manufacture\ncomponents for power electronics or for optoelectronics from compound semiconductor\nmaterials.\nOur systems in the field of power electronics are used for the production of gallium\nnitride (GaN) semiconductor components, which, for example, increase the performance\nof chargers in consumer electronics, enable energy-saving power supply for servers and\ndata centers and efficient power conversion in the field of renewable energy. A second\nmajor field of application for power electronics are silicon carbide (SiC) components,\nwhich are used, for example, in the main inverters for electric vehicles, in their charging\ninfrastructure, and also in inverters for renewable energies (solar and wind). These\ncomponents are also manufactured by our customers using our CVD systems. Both GaN\nand SiC are material systems with a wide band gap (WBG) that are beginning to be\nincreasingly used in various areas of power electronics. Through their use, they contribute\nto the decarbonization of our modern society and make an important contribution to\nclimate protection.\nOn our systems in the field of optoelectronics, customers manufacture lasers for fast\noptical data transmission and for 3D sensors. The latter are increasingly used in\napplications that require recognition of the spatial context, e.g. in the environment\ndetection of robots or in autonomous vehicles. Another area of application is the\nproduction of LED picture elements (pixels) for display applications of the next\ngeneration, so-called micro LED displays. Other applications of our systems include the\nproduction of special LEDs, such as red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY) for automotive\nlighting and indoor farming, among others.\nAIXTRON is continuously working to improve its existing technologies and products. After\nAIXTRON presented the first system of the newly developed generations with the G10-SiC\nin 2022, the G10 product family was completed last year by the G10-GaN and the G10-\nAsP. The G10-GaN is a fully automated, compact MOCVD cluster tool for high-production\npower electronics factories and can be used to produce GaN devices on both 150mm and\n200mm wafers. The G10-AsP is designed for the production of optoelectronic\ncomponents e.g. for optical data communication or micro LED and can also be used for\n150mm and 200mm wafers. In addition to continuously improving material performance,\nthe focus of the entire G10 product family is particularly on further optimizing the\nsystems for large-scale production through more automation with industry-standard\ninterfaces, for example through the efficient use of limited clean room areas in\nsemiconductor factories.\n68\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Processes\nManufacturing and Procurement\nAIXTRON produces its prototype and customer systems at its production sites in\nHerzogenrath and Cambridge. Production focuses on assembly, testing and qualification\nas well as commissioning of the systems according to standardized specifications.\nThe group sources the components required to manufacture the systems and the\nmajority of the pre-assembled assemblies from external suppliers and service providers.\nWe optimize the performance of our supply chains in order to cover the increased overall\ndemand and to compensate for fluctuations in delivery ability. Based on a rolling forecast,\nnecessary measures are taken to ensure material availability in close coordination\nbetween sales, purchasing and production. This also includes the early detection of\nbottlenecks in raw materials and components. In collaboration with our partners in the\nsupply chain, we use appropriate strategies to ensure the availability of inventory.\nThe assembly of the systems is carried out with the help of external service providers in\nour own or, if necessary, in rented nearby production facilities. The subsequent\ncommissioning, testing and qualification of the systems is carried out by AIXTRON\nspecialists. The planning, control and monitoring of production is the sole responsibility of\nAIXTRON employees, thus enabling quality requirements to be met throughout the entire\nproduction process.\nIn 2022 and during 2023, AIXTRON successfully completed the market launch of the\nproducts G10-SiC, G10-AsP and G10-GaN series production.\nAIXTRON's production sites have a process-oriented quality management system certified\naccording to ISO 9001:2015. In 2023, external auditors have certified the quality\nmanagement systems of both AIXTRON SE and AIXTRON Ltd. confirmed without any\ndeviation.\nEmployees\nAIXTRON’s leading position in the global market and ability to continually innovate are the\nresult of the commitment and knowledge of our employees. Therefore, our human\nresources department is designed to create a safe and supportive working environment\nand to promote a culture of appreciation and collaboration.\nAttracting and retaining highly qualified and committed specialists and managers is a key\nsuccess factor. Competing for the best talent, we are continuously enhancing our\nattractiveness as an employer brand. In addition to a comprehensive, informative careers\nsite and other communication channels, we use a wide variety of target group-oriented\nrecruitment channels, increasingly in social media. Personal contact with potential\napplicants at job fairs and similar events, as well as in the context of our close\ncooperation with universities worldwide, is also of great importance to us.\nAIXTRON is working consistently to establish a modern corporate culture with a mature\nleadership culture and good teamwork. We attach great importance to supporting our\nemployees competently and in a spirit of partnership, to promoting them individually,\nand to challenging them with future-oriented projects and tasks. As part of our company-\n69\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nwide personnel development concept, we offer our employees a wide range of measures\nfor continuous training as well as individual advanced training measures and\ndevelopment opportunities. This includes e-learnings in the areas of health, software,\ncommunication or conflict management, which our employees can use at any time, but\nalso training on working methods such as time, project management and facilitation\ntechniques, which are carried out with external trainers. In addition, employees can take\nadvantage of coaching and mediation services.\nAnother central pillar of our corporate culture is AIXTRON’s commitment to diversity and\nequal opportunities, which form an essential basis for our innovative strength and\ncompetitiveness. We explicitly encourage collaboration in diverse teams. We also attach\ngreat importance to an appropriate gender balance and a balanced age structure.\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the number of employees in the Group increased by\napproximately 21% from 895 at the end of 2022 to 1,086 as at 31 December 2023. The\nincrease in the number of headcount is due to the continued strong growth of the\nGroup's core business. As in previous years, the majority of employees are located in\nEurope.\nCustomers and Geographic Regions\nToday's customers of AIXTRON have successfully established and expanded their value\nchains in the fields of power electronics, optoelectronics and the display industry.\nIncreasing digitalization has raised the need for semiconductor devices with higher\nperformance for applications in IT infrastructure, such as data centers. Consumer\nelectronics, as well as power generation and electromobility, are also driving the\ndevelopment of the current markets. Electromobility in particular is gaining in\nimportance: Due to the rapid adoption of power semiconductors and their low switching\nlosses, which leads to efficiency increases in power conversion, we are experiencing\nstrong growth in the high-performance areas of power electronics. The main applications\nare inverters in electric vehicles as well as fast charging stations. In addition, they are\nused in railway technology, wind and solar energy generation, and in industrial\napplications where high-voltage current is processed.\nIn optoelectronics, AIXTRONS’s customers still manufacture lasers for data transmission,\nentertainment electronics and the automotive sector and are advancing into areas of\nautonomous driving.\nCustomers from the display industry, on the other hand, concentrate, among other\nthings, on the production of new types of LEDs (mini and micro LEDs) - already with the\nfirst demonstrators - in order to address displays of all sizes, from smartwatches to large-\narea display panels.\nIn today's customers ecosystem, we differentiate between customers who either prefer\nvertical integration and thus serve the entire value chain up to the end user, or\nindependent manufacturers of various devices or epitaxy wafers. The latter supply\nproducts manufactured on AIXTRON equipment to companies at the next stage in the\nvalue chain, the manufacturers of electronic components. In addition to industrial\ncustomers, AIXTRON's customers also include research institutes and universities, where\nresearch into novel materials and new fields of application is being driven forward to\ncreate the basis for novel components of the next generation.\n70\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON's products are sold worldwide. The market segments and the product mix are\nregionally different. The current demand for systems for the production of GaN and SiC\npower semiconductors is mostly driven by the expansion of production capacities in\nwestern markets such as America and Europe. AIXTRON generates around half of its\ncurrent sales here. The other half is generated in Asia, with power electronics also\naccounting for a large portion of sales, followed by optoelectronics with a little less than\n40%.\nThe Development of Revenues chapter contains a detailed breakdown of revenues by\nregion.\nObjectives and Strategy\nWith the development, manufacture, sale and maintenance of systems for deposition of\ncomplex compound materials, AIXTRON addresses growing future markets along many\nend-use fields, such as consumer electronics, IT infrastructure, the automotive industry,\ntelecommunications and power generation.\nIn the area of these complex deposition processes, AIXTRON's strategy is to develop the\ntechnology and products with a clear focus on its core competencies in such a way that\nthey address as many end applications as possible. Above all, it is about increasing\nproductivity and thus a high level of competitiveness in the specific requirement profile of\nthe respective application. In this way, AIXTRON is addressing the fast-growing end\nmarkets in order to generate income for the development of other promising future\napplications.\nTechnology Portfolio for Complex Material Deposition\n71\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOur strategic goal is to secure our market position in our core markets in the long term\nthrough continuous innovation and technological leadership. In addition, we aim to\nexpand the range of addressable end applications and penetrate adjacent markets by\napplying our core competencies. The ecological and economic sustainability of our\nbusiness, increasing sales and improving profitability are at the center of our strategic\nplanning.\nThe core of our strategy is to adapt the products to the requirements of the respective\napplication areas while maintaining the focus on using AIXTRON's core competencies. This\ntargeted addressing of the applications and markets that are attractive for AIXTRON in\nterms of size, growth, profitability and differentiation potential is currently very\nsuccessful. Because these applications from different areas such as consumer electronics,\nIT infrastructure and electromobility are subject to growth dynamics that are largely\nindependent of one another. AIXTRON is not dependent on a single segment, but strives\nto be robust against fluctuations in individual application markets across the range of\napplications and the broadly diversified customer base. For this purpose, AIXTRON is\nactively developing a broad technology portfolio through its own or funded\ndevelopments, through cooperation or targeted acquisitions. The maintenance and\ndevelopment of technology ecosystems in close cooperation with customers and, if\nnecessary, their customers or technology partners allows AIXTRON to establish new\ntechnologies and develop new applications.\nOur main focus is on markets where the application of our technology enables a clear\ndifferentiation from our competitors and thus offers significant added value to our\ncustomers. This is achieved, among other things, by the homogeneity of the physical\nproperties of the deposited layers and thus a high yield on the wafer with simultaneous\nhigh throughput and low material and maintenance costs. An important differentiating\nfactor is the high productivity and cost-effectiveness of our systems, e.g. due to the high\nthroughput of the systems thanks to the so-called batch reactor, in which several wafers\ncan be produced at the same time. This allows our customers to allocate the direct and\nindirect system costs, such as costs for clean room space, to high production volumes. In\nmany applications, the high efficiency of the use of materials due to the reactor\narchitecture is another important cost factor.\nAIXTRON is pursuing a platform strategy with its system families based on the planetary\nprinciple. With a high proportion of identical parts, the systems can be customized. As\noutlined in the previous section, this enables broad diversification and the use of\nnumerous applications. In addition to the planetary systems, which address customers\nwith high production volumes, AIXTRON sells systems based on the showerhead principle\nin university and niche markets. AIXTRON makes this possible, e.g. to be involved early in\nthe development of newly emerging applications and to understand the emerging\ncustomer needs in new markets at an early stage.\n72\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nControl System\nSince numerous business activities within the group are largely integrated at the\noperational level, the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE controls the group at the level of\nthe overall group. The developments forecast for the Group by the Executive Board\ntherefore also apply to AIXTRON SE.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nThe most important financial performance indicators for the AIXTRON Group are\nrevenues, gross profit relative to revenue (gross margin) and earnings before interest and\ntaxes relative to revenues (EBIT margin). They are determined monthly in the AIXTRON\nreporting system and made available to management in a comprehensive report. This\nenables the Executive Board to identify growth drivers at an early stage, to analyze\ndevelopments during the year and take prompt countermeasures in the event of any\ndiscernible deviations.\nAIXTRON aims to achieve organic revenue growth, exchange rate effects are excluded\nwhen setting revenue targets. The gross margin provides information on the profitability\nand return on investment of AIXTRON’s operating business. The EBIT margin is used as an\nadditional important indicator for operational management and analysis of the earnings\nsituation.\nThe key financial indicators mentioned are the most important financial performance\nindicators for AIXTRON.\nFurther performance indicators\nOrder intake was classified as a key performance indicator until the 2023 financial year.\nSince short-term market and demand fluctuations, large individual customer orders and\nthe fulfilling of requirements to book existing orders in order intake are becoming\nincreasingly difficult to predict, using it as a central financial performance indicator and a\nshort-term forecast is no longer meaningful.\nHowever, order intake remains an important performance indicator and is explained\nbelow in the order development section.\nNon-Financial Performance Indicators\nSince the introduction of the current Executive Board remuneration system in fiscal year\n2020, AIXTRON has defined annual sustainability targets for the Executive Board as part\nof the Long Term Incentive (LTI), which are to be achieved over a three-year reference\nperiod, and includes corresponding non-financial performance indicators in the Group\nmanagement.\nThe following non-financial performance indicators were defined for the LTI reference\nperiod beginning in the 2023 financial year:\n• Share of ecologically sustainable sales revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx) and\noperating expenditure (OpEx) within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n• Strategic management and personnel development, measured based on defined\nquotas\n73\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nIn addition to the R&D center at its headquarters in Herzogenrath, AIXTRON also operates\na R&D laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. These in-house laboratories are\nequipped with AIXTRON systems and are used to research and develop new equipment,\nmaterials and processes for the production of semiconductor structures.\nIn May 2023, the company announced that it will invest in a new innovation center at the\nHerzogenrath site. The start of the construction project, which includes a clean room area\nof around 1,000 square meters, was initiated in November 2023. The new building will\nprovide sufficient space for the development of the next product generations.\nFocus on Innovation\nThe Group's R&D activities in 2023 continued to include development programs for future\ntechnologies and new products, as well as continuous improvement of AIXTRON's existing\nproducts. In order to increase industrial maturity, products were optimized along the\nentire value chain, e.g. through design improvements of externally supplied components\nor through improved data analysis. In addition, AIXTRON is working on customer-specific\ndevelopment projects and researching new technologies, often in the context of publicly\nfunded projects.\nThe Group’s R&D expertise remains of great strategic importance to AIXTRON, as we\nbelieve it ensures a competitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the\nfuture business development. AIXTRON invests specifically in research and development\nprojects in order to maintain or expand the Company’s leading position in MOCVD\nequipment for applications such as lasers, Micro LEDs, specialty LEDs and for the\nproduction of wide-band-gap materials for power electronics. In addition, the Group is\nworking on novel 2D-nanostructures, which are currently seen as having great potential in\nresearch.\nFor the consistent technological evolution of our product portfolio, we invested EUR 87.7\nmillion, or around 14% of revenues (2022: EUR 57.7 million, 12% of revenues), in research\nand development (R&D) in 2023. At year-end 2023, 366 of AIXTRON Group’s total 1,086\nemployees were employed in the Research and Development department (2022: 254 of\n895 employees).\nTechnology Protection through Patents\nAIXTRON aims to secure its technology by patenting and protecting inventions, provided\nit is strategically expedient for the Company to do so. As of December 31, 2023, the\nGroup had 265 (thereof AIXTRON SE: 250) patent families available (December 31, 2022:\n252 patent families). In the reporting period, new applications for patent protection were\nfiled for 14 patent families (AIXTRON SE: 13), and one patent expired. Usually, patent\nprotection for inventions is applied for in those markets relevant to AIXTRON, specifically\nin Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. AIXTRON's patent\nportfolio is evaluated annually and adjusted accordingly. The individual patents expire\nbetween 2024 and 2043. In addition, AIXTRON continuously performs a worldwide patent\nanalysis in order to identify and assess changes in the competitive environment at an\nearly stage.\n74\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResearch Projects 2023\nTogether with our project partners, we again worked on promising research projects in\nthe reporting year. Here, too, we operate on a global scale and focus on areas with\nattractive growth potential.\nExamples of the Group's research work include the following projects:\nThe aim of the HoverGaN project (holistic development of vertical GaN transistors for\noperating voltages up to 1.7kV) is to research future-oriented vertical transistor\narchitectures. The aim is to develop and test powerful transistors with low static and\ndynamic losses and high dielectric strength on low-defect GaN substrates. AIXTRON SE\nwill fundamentally investigate and further develop the MOCVD technology for deposition\nof the necessary layer structures.\nThe BMBF joint project NEUROTEC researches technologies for neuromorphic electronics.\nA central building block is the memristive cell. The project contributes to the digital\ntransformation and strengthening of high technology in the Rhineland region. In the\nAIXTRON sub-project, MOCVD technology for deposition of the required layer structures,\nhere 2D materials, is being intensively researched and further developed.\nThe EU-funded project SKYTOP (Topological Insulators and Weyl Semimetals Technology)\naims to combine topological states in both real and reciprocal space through the use of\nTopological Materials (TM) such as Topological Insulators and/or Weyl Semimetals and\nmagnetic skyrmions. The aim is to develop a Skyrmion-TM based platform and realize\ndevices with interlocking electronic spins and topologies for improved efficiency and new\nfunctions. These should lead to a new paradigm for ultra-dense, low-power\nnanoelectronics. AIXTRON is developing the necessary MOCVD system technology for a\nroute to exploit the emerging Weyl semimetal materials\nTRANSFORM (Trusted European SiC Value Chain for a greener Economy) is a research and\ndevelopment project funded by the EU and national funding authorities. This project aims\nto establish a complete and competitive European supply chain for power electronics\nbased on SiC semiconductor technology from substrates to energy converters such as\ntransistors and modules. It is intended to serve as a source of supply for silicon carbide\ncomponents and systems in Europe.\n75\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Economic Position\nGlobal Economy\nAs a manufacturer of capital goods, AIXTRON may be affected by the development of the\ngeneral economic environment, as this could impact its own suppliers, manufacturing\ncosts, and sales opportunities, driven by the customers' willingness to invest.\nDespite numerous challenges in some regions, the economic environment in 2023 has\ndeveloped somewhat more positively than expected. The US economy in particular\nperformed better than expected, while growth in other regions of the world varied widely\nand remained below expectations. The central banks continued to raise key interest rates\nto curb high inflation. Although inflation eased slightly, it remained at a very high level in\nmany areas. Supply chains also relaxed, driven by lower freight costs and increased\nfreight capacity.\nAfter the significant adjustments to the growth forecasts at the beginning of 2023, the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) is assuming 3.1% and thus stable growth in global\neconomic output compared to 2023 in its “World Economic Outlook Update” (WEO) from\nJanuary 2024. The forecast for 2024 is therefore at the level of the forecast from October\n2023. For the industrialized nations, the expected growth rate for 2024 is 1.5% (2023:\n1.6%). The growth rate for emerging and developing countries in 2024 is expected to be\n4.1% (2023: 4.1%). Expectations for world trade in 2023 were 0.4% (2022: 5.2%) and are\nexpected to rise to 3.3% in 2024, while the inflation rate in industrialized nations is\nexpected to decrease significantly compared to the previous year at 5.8% (2022: 6.8%).1\nThe strongly export-oriented German machinery and equipment engineering sector also\nsuffered from increasing reluctance of customers to invest over the course of the year\ndue to the increased economic uncertainties. According to order balance of the German\nEngineering Federation (VDMA), companies recorded a price-adjusted decline in incoming\norders of 12% in 2023. International orders decreased by 13% while domestic orders\ndecreased by 11%.2\nDemand for AIXTRON's products remains largely dependent on industry-specific\ndevelopments, such as the introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, IT\ninfrastructure, electromobility, or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor\nmarket. These developments are based on the megatrends of digitalization,\nelectrification, and sustainability and thus continued to be very robust.\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rate showed a very volatile development under the impact of\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve's actions to reduce inflation in 2023. The US dollar closed the\nyear at 1.11 USD/EUR (2022: 1.07 USD/EUR), depreciating by around 3.5% overall.\nAIXTRON applied an average USD/ EUR exchange rate of 1.08 USD/EUR in fiscal year 2023\n(Q1/2023: 1.07 USD/EUR; Q2/2023: 1.09 USD/EUR; Q3/2023: 1.09 USD/EUR; Q4/2023:\n1.08 USD/EUR). On average over the year, the exchange rate was thus slightly above the\nprior-year average (2022: 1.06 USD/EUR). Compared to the previous year, this had a\nmoderate impact on the Group’s US-dollar-denominated revenues.\n1 IMF: World Economic Outlook Update, January 2024\n2 VDMA: Incoming orders December / total 2023, February 2024\n76\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON’s Executive Board continuously monitors the developments of the global\neconomy and the financial markets to decide what can potentially be done to mitigate\nnegative external effects on AIXTRON’s business. The global crisis situations and market\ndevelopments continued to have only a minor overall impact on AIXTRON's business. In\n2023, no forward exchange contracts or other hedging transactions were entered into.\nTherefore, no currency hedging contracts were in place as of December 31, 2023. The\nExecutive Board reserves the right to carry out hedging transactions in the future, should\nthis be deemed appropriate.\nCompetitive Positioning\nCompetitors in the market for CVD/MOCVD equipment are Veeco Instruments, Inc. (USA,\n“Veeco”), Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan, “TNS”), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan, “TEL”), ASM\nInternational N.V. (Netherlands, “ASMI”), Nuflare Technology Inc. (Japan, „Nuflare“),\nAdvanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. (China, “AMEC”), Beijing NAURA\nMicroelectronics Equipment Co., Ltd. (China, “Naura”) and Tang Optoelectronics\nEquipment Corporation Limited (China, “TOPEC”). Other companies are also continuing to\ntry to qualify their own CVD/MOCVD-systems with their customers. For example,\nTechnology Engine of Science Co. Ltd. (South Korea, “TES”), Zhejiang Jingsheng\nMechanical & Electrical Co., Ltd. (China, “JSG”) and Hermes-Epitek Corp. (Taiwan,\n“HERMES”) and Shenzhen Nashe Intelligent Equipment Co., Ltd. (China, “Naso Tech”)\nworked on developing its own CVD/MOCVD system solutions and are trying to establish\nthem on the market.\nAccording to a study by the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON has maintained\nits global market leadership position in 2022. AIXTRON's once again takes the top spot:\nmarket share has slightly decreased to 70% (2021: 75%), followed by AMEC (China) with\n18% (2021: 14%) and Veeco (USA) with 12% (2021: 11%). At the same time, the global\nmarket for MOCVD tools grew from USD 561 million to USD 566 million in 2022. For fiscal\nyear 2023, no current market share figures from independent market analysts are yet\navailable.\nKey Target Markets\nMarket For Power Semiconductors Based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) Materials\nGallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC)\nPower semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials are one of the main\napplications of AIXTRON's deposition technology. These materials enable the production\nof very compact and highly efficient power supplies and AC/DC as well as DC/DC\nconverters which are used, for example, in the industrial space for applications such as\npower supplies of modern data centers, the more efficient feed-in of regenerative\nenergies into the power grid and in electromobility. They are therefore increasingly used\nin a broad spectrum of applications covering a wide power range. WBG power\nsemiconductors reduce conversion losses by up to 40% and thus contribute significantly\nto increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO emissions. There are two main groups of\n2\ncommercially available WBG power semiconductors: GaN (gallium nitride) and SiC (silicon\ncarbide).\n77\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMarket for Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power Semiconductors\nGaN semiconductor components are primarily used in low and medium power and\nvoltage classes, such as in power supplies for smartphones and laptops as well as in the\npower supply for modern data centers. According to analysts at Yole Group (Yole), GaN\nsemiconductor device sales were USD 235 million in 2023 compared to USD 126 million in\n2021, growing at an average annual rate of over 30% over the past two years, which\nunderlines the increasing market acceptance of GaN technology in the field of power\nsemiconductors. For example, there is already a wide range of commercially available\n65W power supplies that use GaN technology and are marketed as such. In addition,\ncustomers are continually developing new applications, for example in the area of data\ncenters, in IT infrastructure as well as micro inverters in the area of photovoltaics or on-\nboard chargers in the area of electromobility. In addition, the customer base for AIXTRON\nsystems for the production of GaN semiconductor components is continually expanding\nwhile existing customers expand their production capacities.\nDue to the wide range of applications, analysts of the Yole Group (Yole) expect the\nmarket for GaN power semiconductors to grow very strongly to USD 2.2 billion in 2028,\ncorresponding to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 60%.\nFurthermore, GaN semiconductor devices are increasingly used in high-frequency\napplications. In 5G telecom networks and likely in subsequent network generations such\nas 6G, the GaN technology advantage of lower power losses at high frequencies comes\ninto play. As a result, more and more manufacturers of high-frequency switches are\nchanging their production from Silicon to GaN. Yole analysts forecast the GaN high-\nfrequency semiconductor device market to grow from USD 1.3 billion in 2022 to USD 3.0\nbillion in 2027 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%.\nMarket for Silicon Carbide (SiC) Power Semiconductors\nThe adoption of SiC power semiconductors in the area of high-voltage and high-power\napplications has increased further in 2023 The main fields of application within\nelectromobility are in particular the main inverters in the powertrain as well as the on-\nboard chargers, but also the charging stations, as well as the inverters in the field of\nindustrial photovoltaics and wind energy. SiC is also used in industrial motor control\nsystems. In all these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in conversion losses\nduring the conversion of electrical energy. This leads, for example, to a greater range per\nbattery charge in battery electric vehicles and to lower conversion losses in the field of\npower generation.\nDriven by significantly increased awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and\nCO reduction, both in the regulatory and private sectors, as well as by bans imposed in\n2\nseveral countries on the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines from 2035\nonwards, car manufacturers worldwide have raised their targets for powertrain\nelectrification.\nBased on this development, Yole forecasts that the SiC device market will grow from USD\n2 billion in 2022 to USD 8 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 40% and are forecasting even\nstronger growth than in the previous year's report (34% CAGR). According to the analysts,\nthis is particularly due to the development of electric vehicles sales and the\ncorresponding fast charging infrastructure.\n78\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLED Market\nRed, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) are used in, among other things, large-format\ncolor displays in sports stadiums, airports and shopping malls, as well as in automotive\ntaillights or in the area of indoor farming. In addition, televisions and monitors in the\npremium segment are increasingly being equipped with Mini LEDs for backlighting as an\nalternative to OLED displays. While the market for the production of conventional LEDs is\ncurrently largely stable, the market for systems for production of Mini LEDs will grow at\nan annual growth rate of 31% until 2028. According to Yole Growth the biggest growth\ndrivers will be automotive applications and are expected to grow by an average of 99.5%\nper year over the same period.\nThe market for UV LEDs (Ultra-Violet Light Emitting Diodes) is another specialized\nsegment in the LED market that AIXTRON addresses. UV LEDs are used for curing plastics\nand disinfecting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking) water. Due to the increasing\ndemand for hygiene, this market is expected to gain importance in the future. After an\ninitial strong increase in demand for mass production systems for UV LEDs in the first\nyears of the COVID pandemic, this has since been significantly reduced to tools for\ndevelopment and small series production in the past year. Nevertheless, UV LEDs are a\nproduct segment with very specific applications such as air disinfection systems, vehicle\nair conditioning or sterilization of running water.\nMarket for Micro LEDs\nMicro LEDs form a basis for new types of displays. Analysts expect Micro LEDs to be used\ninitially in very small displays such as smartwatches and very large displays such as large-\nscreen premium TVs. In the long term, other potential applications include displays in\nsmartphones, tablets and notebooks. Micro LED technology is currently still in the early\nstages of development but has seen very large investments in the recent past. The speed\nof market development and thus the growth rates are strongly linked to the forecasted\ntechnical progress, but are generally very high. The market researchers at Yole estimate\nthe market for Micro LED panels to be approximately USD 150 million in 2024 with strong\ngrowth to USD 1 billion in 2027 and further to USD 2.2 billion in the base scenario\n(corresponding to a CAGR of 80% ) or to USD 12 billion in the “full penetration\nscenario” (corresponding to a CAGR of 130%) until 2030.\nAs Micro LED technology matures, AIXTRON expects the currently still very young market\nfor Micro LEDs to mature both technically and commercially. Developments are currently\nfocusing on the cost per pixel, as well as on the yield and quality of the industrial\nmanufacturing process. Accordingly, analysts also expect the initial commercial\nintroductions in the area of high-end applications and a subsequent continuous expansion\nof the applications across other segments.\nMarket for Laser-based Optical Data Transmission\nThe volume of data, transmitted over fiber optic cables continues to increase, driven by\nthe increased use of cloud computing and Internet services. In addition, demand for\nbigger amounts of data will accelerate even further in the coming years due to the\ntriumph of artificial intelligence. The ongoing increase of video-on-demand use and\ncommunication from connected devices via the Internet (\"Internet of Things\") also\n79\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\ncontribute to the increased data volumes. In addition to data volumes, the rapid\ntransmission of data - at the speed of light - also plays an important role in the expanding\nfield of application of optical data communication. Diode lasers manufactured on\nAIXTRON systems are key components for high-speed optical data transmission. The\ngrowth of global data traffic through AI, mobile telecommunications, the transition to 5G\nstandards and the continuous expansion of fiber optic networks are increasing the\ndemand for lasers as optical signal transmitters, photodiodes as receivers and optical\namplifiers and switches.\nMarket research firms such as Yole and Strategies Unlimited expect investments in laser-\nbased communications to continue to increase to accommodate growing data traffic. Yole\nanalysts expect sales of transceivers used in telecommunications to grow at an annual\nrate of 12% from 2022 to 2028. The total market volume in 2028 is estimated by Yole to\nbe over USD 22.3 billion. Yole also expects demand for the laser diodes used for this to\nrise sharply by 2026 and now expects data communications to be the biggest driver of\ndemand over the next five years.\nLaser-based 3D Sensor Market\nLaser-based 3D sensors are often used in high-end mobile phones. Since this technology\nwas introduced to the market with the iPhone® X in 2017, Apple® has been using it in its\ncurrent generation smartphones and is also using it in its tablet series. With these\nsensors, the environment can be captured in three dimensions, which is important for\nmany applications, e. g. augmented reality. Another rapidly growing application of this\ntechnology is in the automotive sector. Autonomously driving vehicles need such 3D\nsensor technology in order to monitor the road in front of them even at night and in bad\nweather conditions and to be able to control the vehicle autonomously.\nAccording to market research firm Yole, demand for laser-based 3D sensors, so-called\nvertical cavity surface-emitting lasers, will increase from USD 980 million in 2022 to USD\n1.4 billion in 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 6% corresponds.\nIn addition to applications in consumer electronics, edge and surface emitting lasers are\nincreasingly being used in the industrial and automotive sectors in the area of 3D sensing.\nYole expects demand for these components to increase sharply by 71% by 2028.\nBusiness Development\nFiscal year 2023 was once again marked by significant geopolitical events, some of which\nhad serious macroeconomic effects. The energy crisis, inflation and serious geopolitical\nconflicts are examples of external factors that many people and companies have had to\ndeal with. We have successfully met these challenges through targeted measures. We\nwere able to gain many new colleagues and fully meet our forecast, which was increased\nover the course of the year, in all areas. Demand for our systems and in particular the\nnewly launched G10 product family has been and continues to be very strong. Our\nprofitability also developed as we expected.\nThe very strong increase in demand for AIXTRON systems for the production of energy-\nefficient silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) power components was able to\n80\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\novercompensate for temporarily lower demand for systems for the production of lasers\nand LEDs.\nWith orders totaling EUR 640.7 million (2022: EUR 585.9 million), we recorded an 9%\nincrease in order volume in the fiscal year 2023. As expected, revenues also developed\nvery positively and, at EUR 629.9 million (2022: EUR 463.2 million), within our guidance\nrange. At 44%, the gross margin was in line with internal expectations. The increased\noperating expenses of EUR 122.3 million was mostly driven by increased expenses for\nResearch and Development. The operating result was EUR 156.8 million with an EBIT\nmargin of 25% (2022: EUR 104.7 million; 23%). This resulted in a net profit of EUR 145.2\nmillion (2022: EUR 100.5 million). For 2023, a free cash flow (cash flow from operating\nactivities - investments in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and non-\ncurrent financial assets + result from the disposal of property, plant and equipment) of\nEUR -109.7 million (2022: EUR 7.7 million) was reported.\nIn 2023, AIXTRON completed the renewal of the product portfolio after successfully\nlaunching the new G10-GaN on the market in September of that year in addition to the\nG10-SiC and G10-AsP systems. Significant orders from both existing and new customers\nhave already been recorded for all systems in the G10 product family. To achieve an\nunabated profitable development of the AIXTRON Group in the future, our product\nportfolio focuses exclusively on product lines with a positive contribution to earnings or\nthose that promise a significant return on investment (ROI) in the foreseeable future.\n81\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\n%\nmillion million million\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 640.7 585.9 54.8 9\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 353.7 351.8 1.9 1\nIn fiscal year 2023, US dollar-denominated order intake and order backlog have been\nrecorded at the budget exchange rate of 1.15 USD/EUR (2022: 1.20 USD/EUR). Spares &\nservice orders are not included in the order backlog.\nIn 2023, total order intake including spares & services stood at EUR 640.7 million, thus\nsignificantly higher than the previous year’s figure. This development was driven in\nparticular by continuously strong demand from power electronics. In Q4/2023, order\nintake was booked at EUR 204.5 million and with that was up 73% against the previous\nquarter (Q3/2023: EUR 118.5 million).\nAt EUR 353.7 million, equipment order backlog as of December 31, 2023, was also higher\nthan the order backlog of EUR 351.8 million at the end of 2022 (2023 budget rate: 1.15\nUSD/EUR; 2022 budget rate: 1.20 USD/EUR). Compared to the end of the previous\nquarter, the order backlog slightly decreased due to the high number of shipments in the\nfourth quarter by 4% at year-end (September 30, 2023: EUR 368.0 million).\nIn line with strict internal procedures, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These\nconditions include the following requirements:\n1. the receipt of a firm written purchase order\n2. the receipt or securing of the agreed down payment\n3. accessibility to the required shipping documentation\n4. a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Executive Board\nreserves the right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is\nsufficiently likely to occur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, the Executive\nBoard comes to the conclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or\ninvolves an unacceptable degree of risk, it will exclude this specific order or a portion of\nthis order from the recorded order intake and order backlog figures until the risk has\ndecreased to an acceptable level. Such Risk factors include, for example, technological\nrisks in orders for new product generations or delays in the granting of export licenses.\nThe order backlog is regularly assessed and – if necessary – adjusted in line with potential\nexecution risks.\n82\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal year 2023 amounted to EUR 629.9 million and were thus significantly\nhigher than in the previous year by about 36% (2022: EUR 463.2 million). EUR 97.6 million\nor 15% of revenues in fiscal year 2023 were generated from the sale of consumables,\nspare parts and services (2022: 18%). Revenues with MOCVD systems rose by around 40%\nyear-on-year. In particular, the strong increase in demand for MOCVD equipment for the\nproduction of GaN and SiC power devices led to an increase of equipment revenues for\npower electronics. Demand for systems in the laser and LED application areas was below\nthe previous year due to temporarily lower demand, but recovered significantly in the\nfourth quarter The proportions of revenues developed as following: Power electronics\ncontributed 74% of equipment revenues, followed by optoelectronics with 12% and LEDs\nincluding Micro LEDs with 11%.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\n% % %\nmillion million million\nEquipment revenues 532.3 85 380.4 82 151.9 40\nService, spare parts, etc. 97.6 15 82.8 18 14.8 18\nTotal 629.9 100 463.2 100 166.7 36\nWith EUR 314.4 million or 50%, about half of the demand was driven by customers in Asia\nin 2023 (2022: 68%).

In\nabsolute terms, operating expenses increased to EUR 122.3 million in the year 2023\ncompared to EUR 90.6 million in the past fiscal year. Increased personnel costs driven by\nthe higher number of employees and higher variable remuneration components\ncontributed to the increase in operating expenses. In addition, research and development\nexpenses increased, while at the same time higher income from the valuation and sale of\nfunds as well as higher government grants more than compensated for the lower foreign\ncurrency income.\nThe following individual effects must be taken into account:\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were higher in a year-on-year\ncomparison at EUR 46.7 million (2022: EUR 40.4 million). In proportion to revenues, SG&A\nexpenses amounted to 7% (2022: 9%). The development was mainly attributable to\nhigher personnel costs as well as higher variable remuneration components.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses, including expenses for development\nactivities for our new generations of systems, increased significantly by 52% year-on-year\nto EUR 87.7 million (2022: EUR 57.7 Mio.). In fiscal year 2023, AIXTRON has both driven\nthe completion of new product generations and already started to invest in the\ndevelopment of next generation products.\n84\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nKey R&D Information\n2023 vs.\n2023 2022 2022\nR&D expenses (in EUR million) 87.7 57.7 52%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 14 12 1 pp\nNet other operating income and expenses in 2023 resulted in an income of EUR 12.1\nmillion (2022: operating income of EUR 7.6 million).

In fiscal year 2023,\na net foreign exchange gain of EUR 0.8 million (2022: EUR 2.8 million gain) was recorded\nfrom transactions in foreign currencies and the translation of balance sheet items.\nAt EUR 115.0 million, personnel costs in fiscal year 2023 were 26% higher than the EUR\n91.1 million in 2022. This increase is due to salary increases to compensate for inflation,\nhigher variable compensation components and increased personnel costs due to the\nhigher number of employees.\nOperating Result (EBIT)\nThe operating result (EBIT) significantly improved year-on-year by 50% and amounted to\nEUR 156.8 million in the fiscal year 2023 (2022: EUR 104.7 million). This resulted in an\nEBIT margin of 25% (2022: 23%). This development is mainly attributable to the year-on-\nyear increase in revenues and related higher gross margin and is thus related to the\nbusiness and cost developments described above.\nResult before Tax\nResult before tax at EUR 157.7 million in 2023 was significantly higher than in the\nprevious year (2022: EUR 105.1 million).

The significant increase is\nprimarily related to the construction of the Innovation Center. Investments were also\nmade in new demonstration systems in the laboratories and in the expansion of\nproduction and development areas.\nGoodwill was EUR 72.3 million compared to EUR 72.5 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThe difference is entirely related to exchange rate fluctuations. No impairment losses\nwere recognized.\nOther intangible assets increased to EUR 4.4 million as of 31 December 2023 (31\nDecember 2022: EUR 3.3 million), due to investments in licenses, software and IT-\nsolutions.\nInventories, including components and work in process, increased by EUR 170.9 million\nyear-on-year to EUR 394.5 million (December 31, 2022: EUR 223.6 million). This\ndevelopment is primarily related to higher inventory levels in preparation for the high\namount of planned sales in the coming quarters.. The inventory turnover rate at the end\nof 2023 was 0.9 (2022: 1.2).\nTrade receivables were EUR 157.6 million at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022:\nEUR 119.7 million), reflecting the high volume of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets decreased to EUR 181.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (31. December 2022: EUR 325.2 million). This development is\nessentially due to the build-up of inventories as a result of the increase in business\nvolume, the increase in receivables due to a disproportionately strong sales contribution\nin the last quarter, and the increased investments, particularly for the construction of the\ninnovation center.\nAs of December 31, 2023, other financial assets include fund investments of EUR 83.7\nmillion (December 31, 2022: EUR 220.4 million).\n86\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLiabilities\nTrade payables increased to EUR 57.8 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31,\n2022: EUR 46.1 million), due to the increased procurement volume.\nProvisions (non-current and current) were similar to previous year's levels at EUR 36.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 (EUR 36.1 million as of December 31, 2022) .\nAt EUR 141.3 million as of December 31, 2023, advance payments received from\ncustomers were on the previous year's level (December 31, 2022: EUR 141.2 million),\nreflecting the ongoing strong order levels.\nOther current liabilities include payments received for publicly funded development\nprojects and decreased slightly year-on-year to EUR 5.4 million (December 31, 2022: EUR\n6.6 million).\nFinancial Position\nPrincipals and Objectives of Financial Management\nAIXTRON has a central financial management system whose primary objective is to\nensure the long-term financial strength of the Group. AIXTRONs financial management\nincludes the control of its global liquidity as well as its interest and currency management.\nFinancial processes and responsibilities are defined throughout the Group. The\ninvestment policy is approved by the Supervisory Board.\nOur capital structure management aims to determine an appropriate capital structure for\neach company within the Group while minimizing costs and risks. An appropriate\nstructure must comply with tax, legal and commercial requirements. The Group increases\nor decreases the capital in line with the strategic orientation of the companies.\nOur liquidity management aims to ensure the effective management of cash flows within\neach company of the group. The central finance department and local management\nmonitor the cash flows within the group on a daily basis and take corrective action where\nnecessary. Financing requirements are covered by cash within the group, either through\nintra-group loans or through changes in equity.\nThe principles of the investment policy are determined by the Executive Board and\napproved by the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE. Excess cash is invested by the finance\ndepartment in accordance with this policy. The policy only allows for low-risk\ninvestments.\nDue to its global business operations, AIXTRON generates a portion of its revenues in\nforeign currencies, i. e. in currencies other than the Euro. The most prevalent foreign\ncurrency relevant for AIXTRON is the US dollar. The associated exchange rate risk is\nmonitored by the central finance department and taken into account as part of liquidity\nmanagement. Speculative foreign currency transactions are not entered into.\nIn the semiconductor equipment industry, it is essential to have sufficient cash and cash\nequivalents at all times in order to be able to quickly finance possible business expansion.\nAIXTRON’s current cash requirements are generally covered by cash inflows from\n87\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\noperating activities. The Company can draw on a high level of cash and cash equivalents\nand other short-term investments to secure further corporate financing and to support its\nindispensable research and development activities. In addition, AIXTRON has the option,\nif necessary and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue financial\ninstruments on the capital market to cover additional capital requirements.\nFinancing\nThe equity ratio increased driven by the high net profit compared to the previous year\nand amounted to 75% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 73% as of December 31,\n2022.\nThe share capital of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 113,411,020 as of December 31, 2023\n(December 31, 2022: EUR 113,348,420). It is divided into 113,411,020 no-par value\nregistered common shares with a pro rata amount of share capital of EUR 1.00 per share.\nAll shares are fully paid in. The increase in share capital is attributable to the shares issued\nin the fiscal year under stock option programs.\nIn fiscal year 2023, 62,600 stock options from past stock option programs were exercised\n(2022: 56,400 options) and no new stock options were issued (2022: 0 options).\nAIXTRON ordinary shares\n31.12.2023 Exercised Expired Allocation 31.12.2022\nStock options to acquire shares 48,300 62,600 1,200 0 112,100\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, AIXTRON did not have any bank borrowings.\nTo safeguard advance payments received from customers for orders, the Group had bank\nguarantee lines amounting to EUR 104.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: EUR\n105.2 million), of which EUR 18.4 million (2022: EUR 49.8 million) had been utilized as of\nthe reporting date.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the year 2023, AIXTRON´s total capital expenditures amounted to EUR 62.6 million\n(2022: EUR 29.7 million).\nDriven by the Group's growth, EUR 60.2 million (2022: EUR 27.4 million) was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2023. Of this, EUR 36.6 million are related to\nthe construction of the new innovation center, which began in November 2023. In\naddition, besides further testing and demonstration equipment in the laboratories, the\ninvestments also include the expansion of production and development areas.\nEUR 2.5 million were invested in intangible assets including licenses (2022: EUR 2.3\nmillion).\nDuring 2023 EUR 139.4 million of fund investments were divested while fixed-term bank\ndeposits changed by EUR 0.0 million (2022: EUR 79.6 million investments in fund\ninvestments; EUR 60.0 million reduction of fixed-term deposits).\n88\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAll capital expenditures in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were self-financed.\nAs of the reporting date, there were investment commitments for the construction of the\ninnovation center amounting to EUR 55.8 million, which will be financed with cash on\nbalance sheet.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nEUR million\nDescription Balance sheet item 31.12.2023 31.12.2022 + / -\nBank deposits Cash and Cash equivalents 98.0 104.8 -6.8\nFund investments Other financial assets 83.7 220.4 -136.7\nTotal liquidity 181.7 325.2 -143.5\nCash and cash equivalents including other financial assets decreased to EUR 181.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 325.2 million).

This is mainly the result of the build-up of inventories and the\nincrease in receivables as of the reporting date.\nCash flow from investing activities in the 2023 fiscal year was EUR 78.1 million (2022:\nEUR -48.3 million). The positive inflow was mainly influenced by the sale of fund\ninvestments, which more than offset the outflows for investments in tangible and\nintangible assets (see also Investments).\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -35.9 million in 2023 (2022: EUR\n-34.6 million). The main drivers were the dividend payment of EUR -34.8 million (2022:\nEUR -33.7 million) and repayments of lease liabilities EUR -1.9 million, (2022: EUR -1.5\nmillion). Cash inflows from the issue of new shares under stock option programs were of\nEUR 0.8 million (2022: EUR 0.7 million).\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments + proceeds from\ndisposals adjusted for changes in financial assets) for the 2023 fiscal year was EUR -109.7\nmillion compared to EUR 7.7 million in 2022. The difference compared to the previous\nyear is mainly related to the increase in inventories, the increased receivables due to the\ntiming of tool shipments and higher investments in property, plant and equipment.\n89\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nManagement Assessment of Company Situation\nIn fiscal year 2023, AIXTRON continued to focus on successfully serving the targeted\ngrowth markets with sustainable profitability. At the same time, the Group continued to\ndrive development and sales activities, particularly for GaN- and SiC power electronics\nequipment and for the production lasers as well as Mini and Micro LED displays.\nEquipment revenues in 2023 amounted to EUR 532.3 million, of this, EUR 396.1 million\n(74%) were generated by MOCVD/CVD systems for the production of components for the\narea of power electronics (GaN/SiC) and EUR 66.2 million (12%) to MOCVD systems for\nthe area of optoelectronics (laser, solar and Telecom), as well as EUR 59.9 million (11%)\nfor the LED area including Micro LED. Further structural growth can be expected in the\nend markets mentioned because the materials gallium nitride and silicon carbide are\nincreasingly replacing traditional Silicon in modern power electronic components, the use\nof lasers in the areas of optical data transmission and in 3D sensing continues to increase,\nand new types of micro LED displays are increasingly being used commercially.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned activities, there is a focus on the costs as well as the\nmargin contributions of individual revenue drivers. Furthermore, the Executive Board\ncontinuously reviews the product portfolio with a view to changing framework\nconditions, such as time windows for the market launch of new technologies or\nevaluation of our customers' product requirements.\nFiscal year 2023 developed very positively in all markets addressed by our core\ntechnology, especially with GaN and SiC power electronics. Management expects further\nrevenue growth in the future, driven by the megatrends of digitalization, electromobility,\nenergy efficiency and environmental sustainability.\nIn this context, the AIXTRON Group maintains a healthy financing structure with a high\nlevel of cash and cash equivalents and without any bank debt.\n90\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAchievement of Guidance in 2023\nThe order intake, revenue, gross margin and EBIT margin forecasts for fiscal 2023\npublished in the Annual Report 2022 and adjusted in conjunction with the publication of\nthe third quarter report were fully met.

In addition to\nten directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries, which are primarily responsible for\nthe worldwide distribution of AIXTRON's products, AIXTRON SE currently holds an 87%\ninterest in the APEVA Group. AIXTRON SE is not managed separately using its own\nperformance indicators because the Company is integrated into the Group management.\nWe refer here to the respective explanations provided for the Group. The economic\nframework conditions of AIXTRON SE are essentially the same as those of the AIXTRON\nGroup and are described in detail in the chapter Report on Economic Position.\n92\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIncome Statement of AIXTRON SE according to HGB\n2023 vs.\nin EUR million 2023 2022 2022\nRevenues 609.6 432.1 177.5\nChanges in inventories 58.2 41.0 17.2\nOther own work capitalized 1.2 0.7 0.5\nTotal output 669.0 473.8 195.2\nOther operating income 13.4 15.2 -1.8\nCost of materials 345.8 235.2 110.6\nPersonnel expenses 85.7 65.3 20.4\nDepreciation 8.6 6.5 2.1\nOther operating expenses 103.0 88.6 14.4\nOperating result 139.3 93.3 46.0\nResult from investments 6.8 5.3 1.5\nNet interest income 4.4 -1.0 5.4\nFinancial result 11.2 4.3 6.9\nProfit before tax 150.5 97.6 52.9\nTaxes on income and earnings 18.5 12.8 5.7\nProfit after tax 132.0 84.8 47.2\nOther taxes 0.3 0.2 0.1\nNet profit for the year 131.7 84.6 47.1\nProfit carried forward 59.5 50.9 8.6\nDividend payment -34.8 -33.7 -1.1\nTransfer to retained earnings -65.8 -42.3 -23.5\nNet retained profit 90.6 59.5 31.1\n93\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations of AIXTRON SE According to HGB\nAIXTRON SE’s revenues amounted to EUR 609.6 million in fiscal year 2023 and thus\nincreased by EUR 177.5 million, or 41%, compared with the previous year (2022: EUR\n432.1 million). Revenues were influenced by continued high demand for MOCVD systems\nin the fields of GaN- and SiC-power electronics, wireless and optical data communication\nas well as LED including micro LED applications. Other revenues are attributable to intra-\ngroup charges.\nRevenues by category\n2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\nmillion % million % million %\nEquipment revenues 507.3 83 350.1 81 157.2 45\nService and spare\n97.6 16 76.4 18 21.2 28\nparts\nOther revenues 4.7 1 5.6 1 -0.9 -16\nTotal 609.6 100 432.1 100 177.5 41\nRevenues by region\n2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\nmillion % million % million %\nAsian 309.5 51 299.2 69 10.3 3\nEurope 187.7 31 63.5 15 124.2 196\nAmericas 112.4 18 69.4 16 43.0 62\nTotal 609.6 100 432.1 100 177.5 41\nAt 51%, about half of the revenue generation in 2023 was driven by our customers based\nin Asia.\nAt EUR 131.7 million (2022: EUR 84.6 million), the net result for the year was significantly\nhigher than in the previous year. The following factors contributed to this development:\nAt 52%, the cost of materials ratio (cost of materials in relation to total output) was\nincreased (2022: 50 %). This is due to relatively higher expenses for purchased services\nand the product mix.\nThe annual average number of employees at AIXTRON SE rose from 542 in the previous\nyear to 709 in the fiscal year 2023. As result of the increased number of employees and\nvariable remuneration components, personnel expenses increased from EUR 65.3 million\nin the previous year to EUR 85.7 million in fiscal year 2023.\nDue to the increase in capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization increased by\nEUR 2.1 million from EUR 6.5 million in 2022 to EUR 8.6 million in 2023.\n94\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOther operating expenses were higher at EUR 103.0 million compared to EUR 88.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2022. The main drivers were increased variable expenses for shipped\nsystems and increased development costs.\nIn comparison to 2022, other operating income decreased from EUR 15.2 million to EUR\n13.4 million in the 2023 fiscal year. This is mainly due to lower income from foreign\ncurrency translation and exchange rate gains.\nIn addition, a result from investments of EUR 6.8 million (2022: EUR 5.3 million) was\ngenerated in fiscal year 2023. As in previous years, the result from investments in the\nfiscal year consists exclusively of dividend payments from subsidiaries.\nNet interest income totaled EUR 4.4 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to EUR -1.0\nmillion in 2022. This is mainly attributable to expenses from the fair value accounting of\nfund investments.\nNet Result AIXTRON SE – Appropriation of profit\nThe net profit of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 131.7 million. An amount of EUR 65.8\nmillion was transferred to retained earnings. Combined with the carried forward profit\nfrom the previous year in the amount of EUR 59.5 million and the dividend payment in\nMay 2023 in the amount of EUR 34.8 million, this results in a new accumulated profit of\nEUR 90.6 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 59.5 million). The\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that a\ndividend of EUR 0.40 per dividend-entitled share (2022: EUR 0.31) be paid for the\nfinancial year 2023.\nAssets and Liabilities and Financial Position of AIXTRON SE\nWith EUR 874.2 million, total assets at the end of 2023 were about 15% higher than the\nprevious year’s figure (2022: EUR 757.8 million). This was due the positive net result for\nthe year.\n95\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBalance Sheet of AIXTRON SE (HGB)\nin EUR million 31.12.2023 31.12.2022\nAssets\nIntangible assets 4.4 3.3\nProperty, plant and equipment 135.8 85.7\nFinancial assets 46.9 46.9\nNon-current assets 187.1 135.9\nInventories 368.8 204.7\nTrade receivables 115.3 83.6\nReceivables from associates 59.2 36.1\nOther assets 8.6 10.5\nSecurities 82.7 220.3\nCash and credit balances at banks 48.7 65.7\nCurrent assets 683.3 620.9\nDeferred expenses and accrued income 3.8 1.0\nTotal assets 874.2 757.8\nin EUR million 31.12.2023 31.12.2022\nEquity and liabilities\nSubscribed capital 113.4 113.3\nTreasury stock -0.9 -1.0\nIssued capital 112.5 112.4\nCapital reserve 292.4 287.0\nRetained earnings 153.0 87.2\nAccumulated deficit 90.6 59.5\nEquity 648.5 546.1\nProvisions 63.6 47.7\nPrepayments received on order 120.5 120.3\nTrade payables 32.5 29.1\nLiabilities from associates 7.3 11.9\nOther liabilities 1.8 2.7\nLiabilities 162.1 164.0\nTotal equity and liabilities 874.2 757.8\n96\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from EUR 85.7 million in 2022 to EUR 135.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2023 due to increased capital expenditures, mainly for the\nconstruction of the innovation center and for laboratory equipment.\nThe increase in inventories from EUR 204.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to EUR 368.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 mainly reflects the expected sales growth of systems in\nthe following quarters and the high order backlog.\nTrade receivables increased from EUR 83.6 million to EUR 115.3 million due to a high\nnumber of deliveries at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\nLiabilities\nThe subscribed capital of AIXTRON SE was at EUR 113.4 million as of December 31, 2023\n(December 31, 2022: EUR 113.3 million). Issued capital was EUR 112.5 million (2022: EUR\n112.4 million). A total of 62,600 shares were issued as part of stock option programs in\nthe fiscal year 2023.\nAs a result of the exercise of the stock options as well as the recognition of share-based\npayments expenses, the capital reserve increased from EUR 287.0 million as of December\n31, 2022, to EUR 292.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Due to the higher net profit, the\nequity ratio increased to 74% in the fiscal year compared to 72% in the previous year.\nTo secure prepayments received on orders, AIXTRON SE had guarantee facilities of EUR\n97.5 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: EUR 97.5 million), of which EUR 17.6 million\nhad been utilized as of the balance sheet date (2022: EUR 47.3 million).\nTrade payables increased to EUR 32.5 million due to the reporting date and a higher\nprocurement volume (2022: EUR 29.1 million).\nAs of December 31, 2023, AIXTRON did not have any bank borrowings, as was the case on\nthe prior-year balance sheet dates.\nInvestments\nAlong with AIXTRON’s growth, capital expenditures in property, plant, equipment, other\nintangible assets and financial assets at AIXTRON SE totaled EUR 60.4 million in fiscal year\n2023 (2022: EUR 30.0 million).\nThereof EUR 58.0 million in 2023 were for property, plant and equipment (2022: EUR 27.2\nmillion) and primarily included the investment in the new building of the Innovation\nCenter and, as in the previous year, investments in laboratory equipment, in test and\ndemonstration facilities as well as expansion of the production areas.\nFurthermore, AIXTRON SE invested EUR 2.4 million in intangible assets for licenses and\nsoftware (2022: EUR 2.3 million).\nInvestments of EUR 0.1 million (2022: EUR 0.5 million) were made in financial assets in\nfiscal year 2023. These related to the foundation of two new subsidiaries.\n97\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLiquidity\nCash Flow Statement of AIXTRON SE (HGB)\nin EUR million 2023 2022\nCashflow\nCash flow from operating activities -75.8 34.1\nCash flow from investing activities 88.4 -104.4\nCash flow from financing activities -29.6 -31.7\nChange in cash and cash equivalents -17.0 -102.0\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 65.7 167.7\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 48.7 65.7\nDevelopment of Financial Position (Cash Flow)\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 17.0 million from EUR 65.7 million to EUR\n48.7 million in the fiscal year, which results from the cash flows described below.\nCash flow from operating activities decreased from EUR 34.1 million in 2022 to EUR -75.8\nmillion in the fiscal year 2023 mainly as a result of the high level of receivables and\nincreased inventories as of the reporting date, which has not yet been fully reflected in\ncash flow.\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR 88.4 million in fiscal year 2023\n(2022: EUR -104.4 million) which is mainly due to the sale of funds amounting to EUR\n137.6 million. In contrast, in 2023 there were cash outflows due to investments in fixed\nassets of EUR 60.4 million. In the previous year, the acquisition of funds in the amount of\nEUR 78.7 million and investments in fixed assets of EUR 30.0 million resulted in cash flow\nfrom investing activities of EUR -104.4 million.\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -29.6 million in fiscal year 2023\n(2022: EUR -31.7 million). Same as in 2022, the main driver of this development was the\ndividend payment of EUR -34.8 million (2022: EUR -33.7 million).\nThere are no restrictions on access to the Company's cash and cash equivalents.\nOpportunities and Risks\nThe business development of AIXTRON SE is subject to substantially the same risks and\nopportunities as the AIXTRON Group. AIXTRON SE generally participates in the risks of its\nsubsidiaries in proportion to its respective ownership interest. As a result of the\ncentralized financial management of the AIXTRON Group, all financing transactions are\nconducted through AIXTRON SE. As the parent company of the AIXTRON Group, AIXTRON\nSE is integrated into the Group-wide risk management system. For further information,\nplease refer to the Opportunities and Risks Report.\n98\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nThe outlook for the AIXTRON Group largely reflects the expectations of AIXTRON SE. The\nearnings development of AIXTRON SE should continue to be in line with that of the Group\nin the future, as the results of the subsidiaries are reflected in the income from\ninvestments of the Group’s parent company. Management by means of performance\nindicators is carried out exclusively at Group level. The comments on the expected results\nof operations and financial position therefore also apply to AIXTRON SE (see in the\nfollowing section “Expected Developments”).\n99\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Expected Developments,\nOpportunities and Risks\nExpected Developments\nFuture Market Environment\nIn its “World Economic Outlook” (January 2024), the IMF forecasts global economic\ngrowth of 3.1% for 2024. Given the expected continued decline in inflation, the IMF sees\nthe risks to global growth as broadly balanced. Global inflation is expected to decline to\n5.8% in 2024 (2023: 6.8%), still above pre-pandemic (2017-19) levels of around 3.5%.\nAIXTRON does not currently expect any significant influence on business development\nfrom the general global economic environment. The industry and sector-specific\nframework conditions for demand for AIXTRON systems remain intact, although an\ninfluence from negative macroeconomic developments cannot be ruled out.\nMarket observers continue to see positive developments for production equipment in the\nsemiconductor industry in the coming years. According to a study published by the\nleading global industry association SEMI in December 2023, the overall market for\ninvestments in wafer fab equipment, which includes AIXTRON's deposition equipment,\nwill decline from an all-time high of around USD 107.4 billion in 2022 to around USD 100\nbillion in 2023 and grow by 3% in 2024. In 2025, SEMI expects a significant increase in the\nmarkets to a sales level of USD 124 billion, still mostly driven by the Korean, Taiwanese\nand Chinese markets. According to SEMI, the market for wafer fab equipment is currently\nburdened by difficult macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the semiconductor\nindustry. However, emerging applications in numerous markets are expected to drive\nsignificant growth in the semiconductor industry again this decade, which should\nnecessitate further investment to expand production capacity.\nRegardless of the market development of the entire semiconductor industry, the market\nsegments on which AIXTRON focuses are determined by a number of megatrends,\nincluding electrification, digitalization and energy efficiency, the development of which\nwill be decisive for the future development and size of AIXTRON's sales markets.\nSales of GaN power semiconductors will be driven by the need to increase energy\nefficiency in the global IT infrastructure and data centers in order to slow down the rapid\nincrease in energy consumption. The electromobility of the future is expected to lead to\nan increased use of SiC components in the powertrain and in the charging infrastructure\nin order to better meet the requirements for range and efficiency.\nThe increasing demand for lasers manufactured on AIXTRON systems is due to the rapidly\ngrowing need for fast and energy-efficient optical data communication (cloud computing,\nvideo streaming, etc.). Likewise, 3D sensor technology in consumer electronics\n(smartphones, TVs) and access control, as well as the progress of industrial digitization\nand a growing number of vehicles that use 3D sensor technology, are contributing to an\nincreased demand for lasers.\n100\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON is deepening its collaboration with many customers on research and pilot\nprojects for the technological advancement of the next generation of displays in\nsmartwatches, TVs, smartphones and notebooks: Micro LED displays, whose self-\nluminous LED pixels can be produced on AIXTRON's MOCVD systems, aim to replace\ntoday's LCD or OLED display technology with innovative, energy-saving alternatives with\nbetter luminosity, contrast, color fidelity and resolution. The commercialization of these\nnovel display technologies will determine the size of these additional new markets for\nAIXTRON.\nExpected Financial and Earnings Position\nFor the financial year 2024 , the Group once again expects sales growth compared to the\nprevious year. Customer demand continues to extend across all technology areas. The\nExecutive Board is optimistic about both the short and long-term positive outlook for\ndemand for MOCVD systems for optoelectronics (Laser, LED and micro LED-based display\napplications) and also power electronics (GaN and SiC-based power electronics).\nBased on the current Group structure, the assessment of the order development and a\nbudget exchange rate of USD 1.15/EUR (2023: USD 1.15/EUR), the Executive Board\nexpects revenues in 2024 in the range of EUR 630 million and EUR 720 million, at a\ncorresponding gross margin of around 43% – 45% and an EBIT margin of around 24% -\n26% in the financial year 2024. For the first quarter of 2024, the Executive Board expects\nrevenues in a range between EUR 100 million and EUR 120 million.\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board assumes that AIXTRON will not require external\nbank financing in the financial year 2024. Furthermore, it is assumed that the Group will\nbe able to maintain a solid equity base for the foreseeable future.\nOverall Statement on the Future Development\nAIXTRON's systems enable the production of power semiconductors for highly efficient\nenergy conversion in the area of power supply for data centers or consumer electronics\nor electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure (GaN and SiC components). Lasers\nmanufactured with the help of AIXTRON systems are key components in fast optical data\ntransmission (cloud computing, Internet of Things), in 3D sensors and increasingly in\ncomplex vehicle assistance systems. AIXTRON technology also enables the production of\nhigh-frequency chips for 5G mobile networks and key components for the production of\nthe latest generation of displays (fine pitch displays, mini and micro LED displays).\nDue to AIXTRON's proven ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative\ndeposition systems in a flexible number for several customer markets, the Executive\nBoard is convinced of the positive future prospects for the group and its target markets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AIXTRON did not have any legally binding agreements on\nfinancial investments or the acquisition or sale of parts of the company.\n101\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisk Report\nRisk Management System\nAIXTRON's risk management system is controlled centrally and includes all of AIXTRON's\nkey organizational units in the process. The Corporate Governance & Compliance\ndepartment, headed by the responsible CFO of AIXTRON SE, is responsible for setting up a\nrisk management system and informs the entire Executive Board and the Supervisory\nBoard of AIXTRON SE at regular intervals or ad hoc if necessary.\nThe primary goals of the risk management system support the achievement of strategic\nbusiness goals and early detection of potential risks compared to the applicable corporate\nplanning that could negatively affect the achievement of strategic business goals and\nbusiness activities. The risk management system supports the Executive Board in the\nsystematic, effective and efficient management of identified risks by defining, prioritizing\nand tracking risk-reducing measures. In order to meet the extended requirements of IDW\nPS 340, the conformity and meaningfulness of AIXTRON's risk management system were\nexamined and essential instruments were further optimized in terms of presentation and\nmeaningfulness. The subject of this consideration was the further development of the\nframework specifications for the risk management system, the risk assessment scheme,\nthe risk-bearing capacity and the resulting overall risk position in the AIXTRON Group. The\nresults and resulting adjustments were integrated into the risk management process and\nrisk reporting, used in the quarterly risk inventory and documented in the Group-wide risk\nmanagement system manual. In order to further optimize the risk management system,\nnew software for the risk management system was introduced in the fourth quarter of\n2022.\nAll risk owners have been trained in the use of the new risk management software and\nhave ongoing access to it. This ensures that abrupt changes in the risk situation or newly\nidentified risks are reported by those responsible for risk and integrated into the risk\nportfolio and reported in a timely manner.\nThe regular, quarterly risk inventory is initiated, carried out and monitored by the central\nrisk management department. All risk owners from the operational and administrative\nareas, all general managers of the AIXTRON subsidiaries and the Executive Board of\nAIXTRON SE are asked about the current developments in already documented risks and\nmeasures to reduce them, as well as possible new risks. The results are collated at central\nlevel and discussed in a risk committee before the Supervisory Board is informed.\nAIXTRON uses a risk management software to support the risk management process. All\nrisk owners have access to the software. This ensures that abrupt changes in the risk\nsituation or newly identified risks are reported by the risk owners and integrated into the\nrisk portfolio and reported promptly.\nAt AIXTRON, all individual risks and risk aggregates are evaluated and classified according\nto a defined scheme. The assessment of the probability of occurrence can be specified in\nfour levels or as a fixed value. The possible extent of damage if the risk occurs can also be\nrecorded in four stages or as a three-point analysis (Best Case, Most likely Case and Worst\nCase). The amount of damage relates to the measured degree of impact on the operating\nresult (EBIT) of the AIXTRON Group. If the risk is significant for relevant risks, a possible\noutflow of cash is also used as the amount of damage.\n102\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe four levels for the probability of occurrence of the risks, in addition to the possibility\nof a fixed value, are divided into:\n• Remote <5%\n• Unlikely 5% – 10%\n• Possible >10% – 50%\n• Likely > 50% – 100%\nThe potential net loss (measured as a percentage of equity) is used as a criterion for\nevaluating the possible financial impact of a risk on the earnings (EBIT) of the AIXTRON\nGroup. The four possible levels in addition to the three-point view were calculated as\nfollows:\n• Acceptable <0.4%\n• Relevant 0.4% – 2%\n• Serious >2% – 4%\n• Critical > 4%\nThe risk effects are presented both in terms of possible gross/net effects and in different\nobservation periods (up to 12 months, 13 – 24 months and longer than 24 months). The\ngross loss represents the loss potential in the event of a risk occurring without taking into\naccount other effects such as risk reduction measures. The net loss describes the loss\npotential in the event of a risk occurring taking into account the effects resulting from the\nrisk reduction measures such as insurance, provisions, budget- and forecast recording of\nrisks. A risk matrix is derived from this assessment, which divides the risks of the AIXTRON\nGroup into the following four risk classes (see chart for color scale):\n• Acceptable risk (green)\n• Moderate risk (yellow)\n• Significant risk (orange)\n• Substantial risk (red)\nSubstantial risks that are classified as “critical” in terms of the amount of damage and\nwith a probability of occurrence in the “likely” category are to be viewed as material risks\nfor the AIXTRON Group within the meaning of the German Accounting Standard (DRS 20).\nSimilar substantial and significant risks are also considered material within the meaning of\nDRS 20 if they have an aggregated net expected value (combination of the amount of\ndamage and probability of occurrence) that can be viewed as “critical” according to the\nsystem described above.\nRisks that are considered to threaten the continued existence of the company within the\nmeaning of DRS 20 would be listed separately.\n103\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisk Map for Individual Risk Factors\nInternal Control System (ICS)\nThe organizational responsibility for the internal control system (ICS) lies with the\nCorporate Governance & Compliance department. The aim of the ICS is to ensure the\nproper conduct of business activities, reliable financial reporting and compliance with\nlegal, regulatory and internal requirements. To achieve this goal, potential operational,\nfinancial and compliance risks are identified, assessed and internal controls are\nimplemented when deemed necessary. The effectiveness of the control measures is\nchecked at regular intervals by the Corporate Governance & Compliance department. In\norder to ensure functional and disciplinary independence, the Corporate Governance &\nCompliance area reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, who regularly informs the\nManagement Board and the Audit Committee about the results of the audits. The\nCorporate Governance & Compliance area has neither direct operational responsibility\nnor authority for the processes within the ICS.\nInternal Control System (ICS) in the Accounting Process\nThe internal control system in the accounting process of the AIXTRON Group includes\nboth the accounting process of AIXTRON SE and the group accounting process. It defines\ncontrols and monitoring activities, which are measures aimed at ensuring the proper\nhandling of business activities, reliable financial reporting and compliance with laws and\nregulations. A control system that is appropriate for the size of the group and business\nactivities is the prerequisite for effectively controlling operational, financial and other\nrisks.\nIn the accounting process, controls are defined at risk points that help ensure that the\nannual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in\naccordance with the regulations. A separation of functions that is adequate for the size of\nthe group and the application of the four-eyes principle reduce the risk of fraudulent\nactivities.\nA global IT system is used to prepare the annual financial statements, the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the consolidation, which ensures a uniform and consistent\n104\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\napproach and data security. Central system backups are regularly carried out for the\nrelevant IT systems in order to avoid data loss. In addition, defined authorizations and\naccess restrictions are part of the security concept.\nThe corporate function Finance of the AIXTRON Group is technically and organizationally\nresponsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements and the consolidated\nfinancial statements. In the decentralized units, local employees are responsible for\npreparing the local financial statements. Uniform group accounting is ensured by group-\nwide specifications in terms of content and deadlines, as well as accounting guidelines\nand valuation principles. The Corporate Governance & Compliance department regularly\nchecks compliance and effectiveness of the controls and is therefore involved in the\noverall process.\nIn the opinion of the Executive Board, these coordinated processes, systems and controls\nensure that the Group accounting process is in accordance with IFRS and the annual\nfinancial statements are in accordance with HGB and other accounting-related regulations\nand laws and are reliable.\nInternal Audit\nThe internal audit is part of the corporate governance organization and is set up by the\naudit committee of AIXTRON SE on behalf of the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE.\nInternal Auditing reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Executive Board.\nInternal Audit's annual plan is discussed with and approved by the Audit Committee and\nthe Executive Board. Internal Audit aims to provide independent and objective auditing\nand consulting services to improve the organization and add value. Internal Audit follows\na systematic and disciplined approach to assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of\norganizational processes and tools. The follow-up to internal audit findings and progress\nis regularly discussed with the Audit Committee and the Board.\nIn addition, the annual internal audit plans are prepared on the basis of a risk-based\nmethodology, which takes into account findings and risks in the area of compliance risk\nmanagement and the internal control systems. Based on the risks and findings, a\nrecommendation for the annual internal audit plan is submitted to the Audit Committee\nfor review and approval. In addition, the findings and risks are reviewed on an ongoing\nbasis and, if necessary, ad hoc reviews are recommended to the Audit Committee.\nOverall Statement on the Effectiveness of the Risk Management and Internal\nControl System\nThe design of the risk management and internal control system described is based on the\nlegal framework and international standards – such as the German Stock Corporation Act,\nthe German Corporate Governance Code or the auditing standard \"IDW PS 340 n.F.\"\nissued by the Institute of Public Auditors. Based on the information made available to the\nExecutive Board of AIXTRON SE, it is not aware of any circumstances that could impair the\nappropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system (RMS) or the internal\ncontrol system (ICS).1\n1 The information in this paragraph (overall statement on the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control\nsystem) was made in accordance with the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code 2022. They are to be\nclassified as \"not related to the management report\" because they go beyond the legal requirements and are therefore not\npart of the substantive audit by the auditor.\n105\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisks Factors\nThe following risks could possibly have a significant negative impact on AIXTRON's results\nof operations, net assets and financial position, net assets, liquidity and the stock market\nprice of the shares as well as on the actual outcome of matters to which the forward-\nlooking statements contained in this combined management report are based relate. The\nrisks explained below are not the only ones faced by the AIXTRON Group. There may be\nother risks that AIXTRON is currently unaware of, as well as general corporate risks such\nas political risks, the risk of force majeure and other unforeseeable events. In addition,\nthere may be risks that AIXTRON currently considers immaterial, but which ultimately\ncould also have a material negative impact on the AIXTRON Group. Please refer to the\nForward-Looking Statement section for more information on forward-looking statements.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the German Accounting Standard (DRS 20), the\nfollowing material risks exist as at December 31, 2023, considered on an aggregated\nbasis:\nMarket and Competition-Related Risks\nAIXTRON's target markets are distributed worldwide, with a regional focus on Asia,\nEurope and the USA. AIXTRON is therefore subject to global economic cycles and\ngeopolitical risks such as the conflict between the USA and China, which could adversely\naffect the business of the AIXTRON Group. Such risks cannot be influenced by AIXTRON.\nThe markets addressed by AIXTRON are cyclical and can therefore be volatile. The timing,\nlength and intensity of these industry cycles are difficult to predict and influence through\nAIXTRON. In order to spread market-related risks, AIXTRON therefore diversifies and\noffers products in different target markets.\nIn each of these markets, AIXTRON competes with other companies. It is possible that\nnew competitors will appear on the market or that established competitors will adopt\nstrategies or launch products that may negatively impact market expectations overall or\nof individual key customers of AIXTRON.\nMarket developments are continuously observed and assessed by AIXTRON. In order to\nreduce the risk of dependence on individual markets and their fluctuations, AIXTRON has\nimplemented a management system designed to ensure that market developments are\nidentified early and used optimally.\nAIXTRON's market and competition risks can have a critical impact on the Group's\nmedium to long-term high sales and profit expectations if the risks materialize.\nIn addition to the requirements of the German Accounting Standard (DRS 20), there are\nindustry-specific, unique technological risks as of December 31, 2023:\nTechnological Risks\nSome of the technologies that AIXTRON offers enable new, disruptive application options.\nThis often means long development and qualification cycles for AIXTRON products, since\ndemanding technical and/or other customer specifications have to be met (sometimes for\nthe first time) before a business deal is concluded.\n106\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDue to the predominantly long-term development and qualification cycles of AIXTRON's\nproducts, there is a possibility that AIXTRON's technologies and products are developed\nfor markets or application areas in which the framework conditions of the end markets or\nthe strategic planning of potential customers change fundamentally in the course of the\ndevelopment cycle.\nThe ongoing focus on research and development activities in the past fiscal year and the\nintensive involvement of external technology partners are still considered by AIXTRON\nSE’s Executive Board to be suitable measures to reduce this risk.\nAIXTRON's technology risks could have a significant impact on the Group's medium to\nlong-term high sales and profit expectations if the risks materialize.\nIf it turns out that a technology risk has materialized and the introduction of a new\ntechnology cannot be implemented as planned, this can result in the planned and\nforecasted revenues being exposed to the risk of being postponed or omitted, and thus\ndevelopment activities being refinanced later than planned or not at all.\nIn AIXTRON's risk management system, the following risks are not considered significant\nfor the Group:\n• Currency and Financial Risks\n• Production and related risks\n• Legal Risks\n• Risks related to patents and intellectual property\nAIXTRON defines IT and information security risks as breaches of integrity, confidentiality\nand liability.\nThe Group has invested in extensive technical and organizational measures to increase\ninformation security and protect information from unauthorized access, unwanted\nmodification or deletion. The information security measures taken are subject to regular\nmonitoring and continuous improvement and are supported by targeted awareness and\ntraining concepts.\nOverall Statement on the Risk Situation of AIXTRON SE\nCompared to the 2022 fiscal year, the overall risk situation remains unchanged for the\n2023 fiscal year, with the exception of the changes described above in the AIXTRON\nGroup. The continuous focus of research and development activities with a emphasis on\nrenewing and expanding the product portfolio streamlines the risk portfolio and thus\nimproves the exploitation of opportunities and the avoidance of risks in AIXTRON's target\nmarkets.\nNeither in the 2023 fiscal year nor at the time of writing of this management report has\nthe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE identified any risks for the company that could\nthreaten its continued existence as of December 31, 2023.\n107\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOpportunities Report\nAIXTRON's core competence is the development of the latest technologies for the precise\ndeposition of complex semiconductor structures and other functional materials. Here the\ngroup has developed a leading competitive position worldwide. In order to maintain or\nexpand these positions, AIXTRON continuously invests in corresponding research and\ndevelopment projects, e.g. for MOCVD systems for the production of semiconductors for\napplications such as micro LEDs, lasers or power electronics. The Executive Board will\nmaintain the focus on AIXTRON's core competence in order to successfully work on\nexisting as well as to successfully open up new markets.\nImportant market segments for power electronics based on wide-band gap materials such\nas gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are the automotive industry, energy\nindustry, telecommunications and consumer electronics. Energy-efficient solutions are\nincreasingly in demand for AC/DC converters and inverters as well as high-frequency\npower amplifiers. The electrification of vehicles and their charging infrastructure with SiC-\nbased components is an important trend. GaN-based components, which enable fast\ncharging of mobile devices, are also becoming increasingly popular. The IT industry, such\nas data centers or servers, also has a high need for energy-saving GaN-based power\nsupplies, which are expected to see even greater demand from other market segments in\nthe next few years. In addition, GaAs or GaN-based high-frequency components\ncontribute to sales, which are used, among other things, for signal transmission in 5G\nnetworks or for the WLAN 6 standard.\nImportant market segments for optoelectronics are consumer electronics, data\ncommunication and display technology. The rapid developments in the field of artificial\nintelligence will lead to an accelerated increase in data volume in the coming years and\nthus the demand for faster and more optical data communication. The use of optical data\ntransmission is also increasingly penetrating shorter distances, e.g. within data centers\nand even servers or for connecting households to the fiber optic network. The global\nexpansion of fiber optic networks for high-speed data transmission is leading to\nincreasing demand for systems for the production of edge and surface emitting lasers\n(EEL and VCSEL). Although these markets are always subject to certain cyclical and\ntechnical fluctuations, AIXTRON expects demand to increase in the coming years,\nespecially if demand for 3D sensing increases due to virtual reality applications or LiDAR\nfor autonomous driving. Demand for systems for the production of red, orange and\nyellow (ROY) LEDs is currently showing signs of recovery. Further growth potential is\nexpected from the increasing commercialization of Micro LED displays, which may lead to\nadditional significant demand for equipment for these demanding applications. These\ndisplay technologies have high potential in various consumer electronics end applications.\nAIXTRON expects that the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end-\nuser markets can have a positive impact on further business development:\nShort Term:\n• Ongoing increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN or SiC-based components for energy-\nefficient power electronics in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, mobile devices\nand IT infrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaN-based components in the field of 5G network infrastructure\n108\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based components in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for\n5G mobile communications or WLAN 6 technology\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for high-volume optical data transmission, e.g.\nfor video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing use of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensing in mobile\ndevices and in infrastructure applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and special LEDs (especially red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) in\ndisplay and other applications\n• Increasing commercialization of Micro LED displays\nMedium to Long Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated energy\nmanagement\n• Increasing use of optoelectronic components for artificial intelligence applications,\nso-called co-packed optics for the highest data transmission speeds\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visible light communication\ntechnology\n• Increasing application of compound semiconductor-based 3D sensing lasers for\nautonomous driving\n• Use of GaN-based components in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for the\nmillimeter wave range of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Increased development activities for high-performance solar cells made from\ncompound semiconductors\nOverall Picture of Opportunities\nAs part of the assessment of our business opportunities, investment opportunities or\ndevelopment projects are reviewed and prioritized in terms of their potential value\nproposition to ensure an effective allocation of resources. We focus specifically on growth\nmarkets that are positively influenced by global megatrends such as increasing\nelectromobility, electrification, energy efficiency, digitization and networking, in order to\nmake the best possible use of the opportunities that arise for the Group's economically\nand ecologically sustainable business development.\nIf identified opportunities are deemed likely to materialize, they are incorporated into\nbusiness plans and short-term forecasts. Trends or events going beyond this, which could\nlead to a positive development for the net assets, financial position and results of\noperations, are observed and can have a positive effect on our medium to long-term\nprospects.\n109\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLegal Disclosures\nGroup Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f\nin conjunction with Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB)\nThe Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f HGB has been\ncombined with the Group Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 315d\nHGB.

It\noffers its customers high-tech systems for the production of high-performance compound\nsemiconductor components for power electronics and optoelectronics. The devices are\nused in a variety of innovative applications and industries. These include laser, LED,\ndisplay technologies, optical and wireless data transmission, SiC and GaN power\nelectronics, and many other leading-edge applications. The Group’s products are used by\na broad range of customers.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Executive Board and\nhave been submitted to the Supervisory Board at its meeting held on February 26, 2024\nfor approval and publication.\n119\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n(A) Companies Included in Consolidation\nCompanies included in consolidation are AIXTRON SE, and companies controlled by\nAIXTRON SE. The balance sheet date of all consolidated companies is December 31. A list\nof all consolidated companies is shown in note 31.\n(B) Basis of Accounting\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR). The amounts are\nrounded to the nearest thousand Euro (EUR thousand).\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the\nrevaluation of certain financial instruments.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, as they are to be applied\nin the EU, requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of income and expenses\nduring the reported period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates and judgements are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if\nthis revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if\nthe revision affects both current and future periods. Estimates and judgments which have\na significant effect on the Group’s financial statements are described in note 36.\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods\npresented in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently by each consolidated company.\n(C) Bases of Consolidation\n(I) Subsidiaries\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the\nCompany and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31\nDecember each year. Control is achieved when the Company:\n• has the power over the investee;\n• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;\nand\n• has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.\n120\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances\nindicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed\nabove.\nEntities over which AIXTRON SE has control are treated as subsidiaries (see note 31). The\nresults of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date\nthat control commences until the date that control ceases.\n(II) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation\nAll intercompany income and expenses, transactions and balances have been eliminated\nin the consolidation.\n(D) Foreign Currency\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro (EUR). In the\ntranslation of financial statements of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone the local\ncurrencies are also the functional currencies of those companies. Assets and liabilities of\nthose companies are translated to EUR at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.\nIncome and expenses are translated to EUR at average exchange rates for the year or at\naverage exchange rates for the period between their inclusion in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the balance sheet date. Net equity is translated at historical\nrates. The differences arising on translation are disclosed in the consolidated statement\nof changes in equity.\nExchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates in the case of\nforeign currency transactions are recognized in the income statement in other operating\nincome or other operating expenses.\n(E) Property, Plant and Equipment\n(I) Acquisition or Manufacturing Cost\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, plus ancillary charges such as\ninstallation and delivery costs, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment\nlosses (see accounting policy (J)).\nCosts of internally generated assets include not only costs of material and personnel, but\nalso a share of directly attributable overhead costs, such as employee benefits, delivery\ncosts, installation, and professional fees.\nWhere parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they\nare depreciated as separate items of property, plant and equipment.\n(II) Subsequent Recognition of Costs\nAIXTRON recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment\nthe cost of replacing components or enhancement of such an item when that cost is\nincurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied in the item will flow\nto the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs such as\nrepairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n121\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(III) Government Grants\nGovernment grants related to the acquisition or manufacture of owned assets are\ndeducted from original cost at the date of capitalization.\n(IV) Depreciation\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each\npart of an item of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives, depreciation method and\nresidual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the year-end date or\nmore frequently if circumstances arise which are indicative of a change. The estimated\nuseful lives are as follows:\n• Buildings 25 - 45 years\n• Machinery and equipment 3 - 19 years\n• Other plant, factory and office equipment 2 - 20 years\nThe useful lives of leased assets do not exceed the expected lease periods.\n(V) Leased Assets\nThe Group only has contracts in which it is the lessee.\nAIXTRON assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of the contract.\nThe Group recognizes a lease asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all\nlease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as\nleases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as\ntablets and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these\nleases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-\nline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more\nrepresentative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are\nconsumed.\nAIXTRON recognizes a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.\nThe leased asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the\nlease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement\ndate, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and\nremove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is\nlocated, less any lease incentives received.\nThe leased asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the\ncommencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the\nexpected end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of leased assets are\ndetermined on the same bases as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition,\nthe leased asset is periodically tested and reduced by impairment losses, if any, and\nadjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment, and leased assets\nin the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are\nnot paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the\n122\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company’s incremental borrowing\nrate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed\npayments, less any lease incentives and variable lease payments that depend on an index\nor rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date.\nThe lease liabilities are included in other non-current payables and other current liabilities\nin the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in\nindex or rate, or if the company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a\npurchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this\nway, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the leased asset, or is\nrecorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the leased asset has been reduced to\nzero.\nThe Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.\n(F) Intangible Assets\n(I) Goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is allocated to\ncash-generating units and is tested at least once per year for impairment, regardless\nthere are any indications of impairment. For the purposes of the impairment test,\ngoodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit. An impairment loss is recognized if the\ncarrying amount exceeds the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use\nof the cash-generating unit. Details of the impairment test are presented in Note 12 (see\naccounting policy (J)). Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.\n(II) Research and Development\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical\nknowledge and understanding using scientific methods, is recognized as an expense as\nincurred.\nExpenditure on development comprises costs incurred with the purpose of using scientific\nknowledge technically and commercially. As not all criteria of IAS 38 are met AIXTRON\ndoes not capitalize such costs.\n(III) Other Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortization\n(see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (J)).\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are stated at their fair value at\nthe date of purchase.\n123\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and patents is expensed as\nincurred.\n(IV) Amortization\nAmortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of\nintangible assets, except for goodwill. Goodwill has a useful life which is indefinite and is\ntested annually in respect of its recoverable amount. Other intangible assets are\namortized from the date they are available for use. Useful lives and residual values of\nintangible assets are reviewed at the year-end date or more frequently if circumstances\narise which are indicative of a change.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n• Software 2 - 5 years\n• Patents and similar rights 4 - 18 years\n• Customer base and product and technology know how 6 - 10 years\n(G) Financial Instruments\n(I) Financial Assets\nFinancial assets are classified into the following specific categories:\n• financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL),\n• ‘at amortized cost’.\nThe classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is\ndetermined at the time of initial recognition.\n(II) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost as they are held within a business model\nto collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(III) Financial Assets at FVTPL\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through\nother comprehensive income under IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit and\nloss (FVTPL).\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period,\nwith any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss including\ndividends earned on financial asset and is included in profit and loss account and in note 5\nor 6 respectively. Fair value is determined in accordance with IFRS 13.\n124\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IV) Trade Receivables\nTrade receivables and other receivables are measured at amortized cost as they are held\nwithin a business model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist\nsolely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(V) Impairment of Financial Assets\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on trade\nreceivables and contract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each\nreporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective\nfinancial instrument. The Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables, and\ncontract assets. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a\nprovision analysis based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for\nfactors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment\nof both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date.\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECL when there has\nbeen a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk\non the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the\nGroup measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to\n12-month ECL. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all\npossible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-\nmonth ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default\nevents on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting\ndate.\n(VI) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with banks with a\nmaturity of less than three months at inception.\n(VII) Equity Instruments\nEquity instruments, including share capital, issued by the Group are recorded at the\nproceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n(VIII) Financial Liabilities\nOther financial liabilities, including trade payables, are measured at amortized cost.\n(H) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is\nthe estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of\ncompletion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using weighted average cost.\nThe cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to\ntheir existing location and condition. In the case of work in progress and finished goods,\ncost includes direct material and production cost, as well as an appropriate share of\noverheads based on normal operating capacity. Scrap and other wasted costs are\n125\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpensed on a periodic basis either as cost of sales or, in the case of beta tools as\nresearch and development expense.\nAllowance for slow moving, excess and obsolete, and otherwise unsaleable inventory is\nrecorded based primarily on either the estimated forecast of product demand and\nproduction requirement or historical usage. When the estimated future demand is less\nthan the inventory, AIXTRON writes down such inventories.\n(I) Operating Result\nOperating result is stated before finance income, finance expense and tax.\n(J) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets are tested for\nimpairment, where there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. The Group\nassesses at the end of each period whether there is an indication that an asset may be\nimpaired. Impairment losses on such assets are recognized, to the extent that the\ncarrying amount exceeds both the fair value that would be obtainable from a disposal in\nan arm’s length transaction, and the value in use.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present\nvalue using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks\nassociated with the asset.\nImpairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to\ndetermine the recoverable amount. Reversals are made only to the extent that the\ncarrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been\ndetermined if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n(K) Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted\naverage number of issued common shares for the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect\nthe potential dilution that could occur if options issued under the Company’s stock option\nplans were exercised unless such exercises had an anti-dilutive effect.\n(L) Employee Benefits\n(I) Defined Contribution Plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nexpense in the income statement as incurred.\n126\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(II) Share-based Payment Transactions\nStock Option Programs\nAs part of the share option programs from 2007 and 2012, share options were issued to\nmembers of the Executive Board, managers and employees of the Group. The contractual\nterms of these share programs are presented in note 22. These stock option programs are\naccounted for according to IFRS 2 for equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\nThe fair value of options granted were recognized as personnel expense with a\ncorresponding increase in additional paid-in capital.\nLong-term Incentive of the Executive Board (LTI)\nExecutive Board remuneration system at AIXTRON SE consists long-term variable\nremuneration incentives (LTI) granted in shares of AIXTRON SE. These equity-settled\nshare-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the grant\ndate. The fair value of the shares granted is measured using a mathematical model, taking\ninto account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted. Further\ndetails regarding the equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 22 and\n31.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period, based on the Group’s\nestimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. For non-market-based\nvesting conditions, the Group reviews its estimate of number of equity instruments at\neach reporting date during vesting period. The impact of the revision of the original\nestimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss and a corresponding adjustment is\nrecognized to equity.\n(M) Provisions\nA provision is recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as\na result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be\nrequired to settle this obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by\ndiscounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current\nmarket assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks\nassociated with the liability.\n(I) Warranties\nThe Group normally offers one- or two-year warranties on all of its products. Warranty\nexpenses generally include cost of labor, material and related overhead necessary to\nrepair a product free of charge during the warranty period. The specific terms and\nconditions of those warranties may vary depending on the equipment sold, the terms of\nthe contract and the locations from which they are sold. The Group establishes the costs\nthat may be incurred under its warranty obligations and records a liability in the amount\nof such costs at the time revenue is recognized.\nFactors affecting the warranty obligation include the historical and expected number of\nwarranty claims and the estimated cost per warranty claim.\n127\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Group accrues warranty cost for systems shipped based upon historical experience.\nThe Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty provisions and\nadjusts the amounts as necessary.\nExtended warranties, beyond the normal warranty periods, are treated as maintenance\nservices in accordance with note 2(N) below.\n(N) Revenue\nAIXTRON enters contracts with customers for goods and services, including combinations\nof goods and services. Contracts are usually for fixed prices and do not offer any unilateral\nright of return to the customer.\nRevenue is generated from the following major sources:\n• sale of equipment\n• installation of equipment\n• sale and installation of customer specific equipment\n• spare parts\n• services\nRevenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation in contracts\nwith its customers by transferring control of promised goods or services to the customer\nand it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to\nthe entity.\nThe sale of equipment involves acceptance tests at AIXTRON ́s production facility. After\nsuccessful completion of this test, the equipment is dismantled and packaged for\nshipment.\nRevenues from the sale of products that have been demonstrated to meet product\nspecification requirements are recognized at a point in time upon shipment to the\ncustomer if full acceptance tests have been successfully completed at the AIXTRON\nproduction facility and control has passed to the customer and the customer can benefit\nfrom the product either on its own or with other resources that are readily available.\nUpon arrival at the customer site the equipment is reassembled and installed, which is a\nservice generally performed by AIXTRON engineers. Revenue relating to the installation of\nthe equipment is recognized at the point in time when AIXTRON has fulfilled its\nperformance obligations under the contract and control of the goods has passed to the\ncustomer.\nRevenue related to equipment where meeting the product specification requirements has\nnot yet been demonstrated or the customer cannot benefit from the product either on its\nown or with other resources that are readily available, or where specific rights of return\nhave been negotiated, is recognized only at the point in time when the customer finally\naccepts the equipment and has control.\n128\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue related to spares is recognized at the point in time at which the customer\nobtains control of the goods, generally at the point of delivery.\nRevenue related to services such as repair works is recognized at the point in time as the\ncustomers accepts the equipment at this point.\nAs part of the payment terms, AIXTRON does not grant any general right of return, cash\ndiscount, credit notes or other sales incentives. Generally, payment terms for advance\npayments and customer invoices are short-term and contracts do not include a financing\ncomponent.\nThe consideration from contracts which include combinations of different performance\nobligations such as equipment, spares and services is allocated to each performance\nobligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer.\nDiscounts from list price are proportionately allocated to each performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on a relative\nstand-alone selling price basis. As the stand-alone selling prices are usually not directly\nobservable, AIXTRON uses the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the\nstand-alone selling price.\nThe portion of equipment revenue related to installation services is determined based on\neither the method described above or, if the Group determines that there may be a risk\nthat the economic benefits of installation services may not flow to the Group, the portion\nof the contract amount that is due and payable upon completion of the installation.\nContract assets may arise for contracts with different performance obligations if the\nrevenue recognized exceed the amounts for received advance payments and customer\ninvoices (see note 16).\n(O) Expenses\n(I) Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes such direct costs as materials, labor, and related production\noverheads.\n(II) Research and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of beta tools which do\nnot qualify to be recognized as an asset are expensed as research and development costs.\nProject funding received from governments (e.g. state funding) is recorded in other\noperating income, if the research and development costs are incurred and provided that\nthe conditions for the funding have been met.\n(III) Lease Payments\nPayments made under leases for assets which have not been capitalized are recognized as\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n129\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(P) Government Grants\nGovernment grants awarded for project funding are recorded in other operating income\nif the research and development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for\nthe funding have been met. Government grants awarded to support continued\nemployment where work is not allowed are recorded as a reduction in the related\nexpense, as this presents the underlying reason for the grant better.\n(Q) Income Tax\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits can be set off against timing differences and tax losses carried forward or taxable\ntemporary differences exist. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no\nlonger probable that the related tax benefit can be realized. The recoverability of\ndeferred tax assets is reviewed at least annually.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between tax\nand commercial balance sheets and for losses brought forward for tax purposes as well as\nfor tax credits of the companies included in consolidation. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities shall be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when\nthe asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nCurrent income taxes for the current and prior periods are recognized as a liability to the\nextent that they have not yet been paid. If the amount attributable to the current and\nprior periods and already paid exceeds the amount due for those periods, the difference\nis recognized as an asset. The amount of the expected tax liability or tax receivable\nreflects the best estimate of the amount, considering tax uncertainties, when applicable.\nThe Group evaluates income tax uncertain treatments on a regular basis. In making this\nassessment, the Group assumes that a tax authority will review the matter in question\nand that it has all the relevant information to do so. If it is probable that an uncertain tax\ntreatment will not be accepted by the tax authorities, the best estimate (expected value\nor most likely value of the tax uncertainty) is used to determine the impact and a tax\nliability is recognized or, in the case of existing loss carryforwards, the deferred tax\nattributable to them is reduced accordingly.\n130\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(R) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in business activities\nand whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision\nMaker, which AIXTRON considers to be its Executive Board, to make decisions about\nresources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which\ndiscrete financial information is available. AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nAccounting standards applied in segment reporting are in accordance with the general\naccounting policies as explained in this section.\n(S) Cash Flow Statement\nCash flows from operating activities are determined using the indirect method.\nCash flows from taxes are allocated to operating activities.\nCash flows from other financial assets (fund investments) are presented in cash flow from\ninvesting activities as the assets are not traded for trading purposes.\n131\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(T) Adoption of New and Revised Accounting Standards\nNew and Amended IFRS Standards Effective for the Current Year\nIn the current year, the Group has applied the below amendments to IFRS standards and\ninterpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are\neffective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2023. Their adoption has\nnot had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIFRS 17 Insurance contracts\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Disclosure of Accounting Policies\nStatement 2\nAmendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates\nAmendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to assets and\nliabilities arising from a single transaction1)\nAmendments to IAS 12 International Tax reform - pillar two model\nrules1)\n1) The amendment has been effective immediately since the publication on May 23, 2023.\nAt the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has not\napplied following new and revised standards and interpretations which have been issued\nbut are not yet effective.

Segment Reporting and Revenues\nIFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about\ncomponents of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, as chief\noperating decision maker, in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess\ntheir performance.\nIn the period 2022 to 2023 the Executive Board regularly reviewed financial information\nto allocate resources and assess performance only on a consolidated Group basis since\nthe various activities of the Group are largely integrated from an operational perspective.\nIn accordance with IFRS, AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nThe Group’s reportable segment is based around the category of goods and services\nprovided to the semiconductor industry\nRevenues are recognized as disclosed in note 2 (N).\nSegment revenues and results\nin EUR thousands Note 2023 2022\nEquipment revenues 532,289 380,410\nSpares revenues 92,329 76,319\nServices revenues 5,261 6,438\nRevenue from external customers 629,879 463,167\nInventories recognized as an expense 15 252,271 186,438\nReversals of inventory provisions 15 -3,081 -3,329\nObsolescence and valuation allowance expense for inventories 15 2,067 1,893\nPersonnel expense 7 114,974 91,133\nDepreciation and impairment 11 10,303 7,674\nAmortization 12 1,308 1,193\nOther expenses 108,320 85,142\nForeign exchange (gains)/losses 5 -193 -1,496\nOther operating income 5 12,857 10,177\nSegment profit 156,767 104,696\nFinance income 8 1,119 803\nFinance expense 8 205 356\nProfit before tax 157,681 105,143\nReversals of impairment allowances are included in other operating income as described\nin note 5.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segment are identical to the Group’s accounting\npolicies as described in note 2. Segment profit represents the profit earned by the\nsegment without the allocation of investment revenue, finance costs and income tax\nexpense. This is the measure reported to the Executive Board for the purpose of resource\nallocation and assessment of performance.\n133\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe transaction price allocated to (partially) unsatisfied performance obligations at 31\nDecember 2023 is EUR 353.7 million (31 December 2022: EUR 351.8 million).\nManagement expects that approximately 91% of the transaction price allocated to the\nunsatisfied contracts as of the year ended 2023 will be recognized as revenue during\n2024.

No reversal of\nimpairment were recognized in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt the end of 2023 the Group assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill and\ndetermined that as in 2022 no impairment loss had to be recognized.\nAs at the end of 2023 the cash generating unit, to which the goodwill has been allocated,\nis the AIXTRON Group Semiconductor Equipment segment.\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined through a fair value\nless cost to sell calculation. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. As AIXTRON has only one cash generating unit (CGU), market\ncapitalization of AIXTRON, adjusted for a control premium, has been used to determine\nthe fair value less cost to sell of the cash generating unit. This is level 2 in the hierarchy of\nfair value measures set out in IFRS 13.\nAs at December 31, 2023 the market capitalization of AIXTRON was EUR 4,351 million,\nbased on a share price of EUR 38.66 and issued shares (excluding Treasury Shares) of\n112,534,618.\nIn an orderly selling process costs are incurred. AIXTRON has used 1.5% to account for the\ncosts to sell.\nA control premium typically in the range 20% - 40% is incurred in the acquisition of a\ncompany. A 20% premium has been applied in this test to adjust the market capitalization\nto the fair value. Market capitalization was also adjusted for net debt and tax assets prior\nto comparing it to the carrying amount of the CGU. The analysis shows that the fair value\nless costs to sell of the CGU AIXTRON exceeds its carrying amount and that Goodwill is not\nimpaired.\n143\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment Test Impairment Test\nEuro millions, except share price 2023 2022\nShare price - Euros 38.66 26.97\nMarket capitalization\n4,350.6 3,031.0\nas of December 31\nCosts to sell in percentage 1.5% 1.5%\nCosts to sell -65.3 -45.5\nMarket capitalization less cost to sell 4,285.3 2,985.5\nControl premium in percentage 20% 20%\nControl premium 857.1 597.1\nMarket capitalization and control\n5,142.4 3,582.6\npremium less cost to sell\nNet debt -181.7 -325.2\nTax assets -36.1 -33.8\nFair value less costs to sell of CGU 4,924.6 3,223.6\nCarrying amount of the CGU 559.8 304.4\nSurplus of fair value less cost to sell\n4,364.8 2,919.2\nover carrying amount\nSurplus of fair value less cost to sell\n780 % 959 %\nover carrying amount as a percentage\nThe fair value less costs to sell, which is the recoverable amount, exceeds the carrying\namount of the CGU by 780% (2022: 959%).\n13.

Generally, the Group demands no securities for financial assets. In\naccordance with usual business practice for capital equipment however, the Group\nmitigates its exposure to credit risk by requiring payment by irrevocable letters of credit\nand substantial payments in advance from most customers as conditions of contracts for\nsale of major items of equipment.\nIn 2023 one customer accounted for 13% of net trade receivables respectively. In 2022\ntwo customers accounted for 11% and 10% of net trade receivables respectively. In\ndetermining concentrations of credit risk, the Group defines counterparties as having\nsimilar characteristics if they are part of the same external group of entities.\nIncluded in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of\nEUR 4,662 thousand (2022: EUR 17,937 thousand) which are past due at the reporting\ndate for which the Group has not provided. As there has not been a significant change in\ncredit quality, and although the Group has no collateral, the amounts are considered\nrecoverable.\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to the\nlifetime expected credit loss. Based on its experience, the Group uses a negligible risk of\ndefault for lifetime, adjusted for factors which are specific to the debtors, general\neconomic conditions, and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast\ndirection of conditions at the reporting date.\nIn determining receivables which may be individually impaired the Group has taken into\naccount the likelihood of recoverability based on the past due nature of certain\nreceivables, and our assessment of the ability of all counterparties to perform their\nobligations.\n148\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

Executive Board members may first dispose of these shares following a\nfour-year holding period calculated from the start of the reference period. Before the\nstart of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets for each\nExecutive Board member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive Board\nmember receives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI as a percentage\nof the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the budget adopted for the fiscal\nyear. The number of forfeitable stock awards is calculated based on the average of the\nclosing prices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter of the previous year.\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for\nthe year and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. The TSR is\ndefined as the total shareholder return over the reference period and is calculated as the\nratio of the share price development including dividends paid at the end of the reference\nperiod to the value at the beginning of the reference period.\nIn this regard, the relative weighting of the targets amounts to 50% for consolidated net\nincome for the year, 40% for TSR, and 10% for sustainability targets. After the expiry of\nthe three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement is determined by\nthe Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement, the forfeitable\nstock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise lapse. The\nmaximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection with LTI is\ncapped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start of the\nreference period.\nThe shares are transferred to the Executive Board member after the four-year restriction\nperiod.\nThe fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is recognized as an\nexpense over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. The\nfair value of the shares granted is measured based on a valuation model taking into\naccount the vesting conditions at which the shares are granted. The calculation takes into\naccount estimates for future dividends. The TSR ratio is used as a market condition in\nestimating the fair value at the valuation date. For the other non-market-based vesting\nconditions, the Group reviews its estimate of the number of equity instruments during\nthe vesting period. Adjustments in the original estimates, if any, are recognized in profit\nor loss and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.\n154\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the main parameters of the valuation model (Monte Carlo\nsimulation) for the long-term variable remuneration of the Executive Board (LTI) for the\nLTI Tranche 2023 and 2022:\nLTI Tranche 2023 LTI Tranche 2022\nGrant date 12.12.22 15.12.21\nShare price at grant date 31.27€ 16.77€\nIndex level Peer Group 111.27 102.61\nRisk-free interest rate 1.94% -0.66%\nVolatility AIXTRON 50.59% 52.08%\nVolatility Peer Group 34.26% 30.41%\nCorrelation AIXTRON/Index 0.58 0.53\nFair Value TSR 41.24€ 19.47€\nFair Value Plain-Tranche 29.96€ 15.93€\nAssumptions regarding volatility and correlation between the AIXTRON share and the\nPeer Group were determined based on historical share price developments.\nWithin the scope of the LTI Tranche 2023 236,101 forfeitable share awards were granted\nwith the weighted average fair value of EUR 34.47 per award on grant date (LTI Tranche\n2022: 224,941 forfeitable share awards with the weighted average fair value of EUR 17,35\nper award). At the end of the reference period, the forfeitable share awards of LTI\nTranche 2023 or 2022 are converted into vested stock awards or partially forfeited.\nIn 2023, the personnel expenses from share-based payments, all of which were equity\nsettled share-based payments, were EUR 4,762 thousand (2022: EUR 4,441 thousand).\nShare-based payments include the expense of long-term incentive of the Executive Board\nwhich is paid in shares (see note 30).\n23.

Key aspects are the exposures to liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk\nand currency risk arising in the normal course of the Group’s business.\nThe AIXTRON Group’s central management coordinates access to domestic and\ninternational financial institutions and monitors and manages the financial risks relating\nto the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyze exposure to\nrisk by likelihood and magnitude. These risks cover all aspects of the business, including\nfinancial risks.\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its existing or future obligations\ndue to insufficient availability of cash or cash equivalents. Managing liquidity risk is one of\n157\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe central tasks of AIXTRON SE. In order to be able to ensure the Group’s solvency and\nflexibility at all times cash and cash equivalents are projected on the basis of regular\nfinancial and liquidity planning.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Group did not have any borrowings (2022: nil). Financial\nliabilities, all due within one year, of EUR 63,136 thousand (2022: EUR 52,679 thousand)\nconsisting of trade payables and other liabilities and are shown in note 24, together with\nan analysis of their maturity. Non-current payables consist of lease liabilities and other\npayables. Long term lease liabilities of EUR 3,803 thousand (2022: EUR 5,874 thousand)\nare shown with an analysis of their maturity in note 27. Other non-current payables of\nEUR 181 thousand (2022: EUR 101 thousand) are due after more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Group had EUR 181,928 thousand (2022: EUR 325,411\nthousand) of bank deposits and investments as described in notes 13, 17 and 18.\nCredit Risks\nFinancial assets generally exposed to a credit risk are trade receivables, financial\ninvestments, and cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Group’s cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are kept with financial\ninstitutions that have a good credit standing. Central management of the Group assesses\nthe counter-party risk of each financial institution dealt with and sets limits to the Group’s\nexposure to those institutions. These credit limits are reviewed from time to time so as to\nminimize the default risk as far as possible and to ensure that concentrations of risk are\nmanaged.\nThe maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk is the total amount of receivables,\nfinancial assets and bank deposits as described in notes 13, 16, 17 and 18.\nFor contract assets measured at fair value, the maximum amount of the exposure to\ncredit risk is the amount of contract assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 25.\nThere are no credit derivatives or similar instruments which mitigate the maximum\nexposure to credit risk and there has been no change during the period or cumulatively in\nthe fair value of such receivables that is attributable to changes in the credit risk.\nMarket Risks\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates and interest rate risks. Interest rate risks are not material as the Group\nonly receives a minor amount of interest income. The Group does not use derivative\nfinancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Cash deposits are made\nwith the Group’s bankers at the market rates prevailing at inception of the deposit for the\nperiod and currency concerned. The Group’s financial investments are made into funds\nbases in the European Union and are exposed to changes in the market value of those\nfunds. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the manner in\nwhich it manages and measures the risk.\n158\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Group can enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its\nexposure to foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts to hedge the\nexchange rate risk arising on the export of equipment. The main exchange rates giving\nrise to the risk are those between the US Dollar, GB Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese\nYen and Euro. No forward exchange contracts were entered into in the fiscal year or in\nthe previous year.\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nmonetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:\nAssets Liabilities\nin EUR thousands 2023 2022 2023 2022\nUS Dollars 82,266 65,057 68,126 51,305\nGB Pounds 4,916 6,079 7,184 4,175\nChinese Renminbi 12,575 25,303 6,058 8,891\nJapanese Yen 17,140 10,193 1,398 397\nExposures are reviewed on a regular basis and are managed by the Group through\nsensitivity analysis.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity Analysis\nThe Group's global operations expose it primarily to foreign exchange risks by the US\nDollar, GB Pound, Japanese Yen and Chinese Renminbi.\nThe following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% change in the value of the\nEuro against the US Dollar, GB Pound, Japanese Yen and Chinese Renminbi.

Advance Payments – Contract Liabilities\nContract liabilities for advance payments from customers occur when a contract requires\nthe customer to pay a deposit to the Group and the deposit has actually been paid,\ntypically near the commencement of the contract, or if it reflects an unconditional\npayment claim. Usually, advance payments are up to 50% of the total contract price.\nThe Group records the liability as the advance payment is received and eliminates the\nliability at the same time and up to the same amount as it records revenue until the\nliability is fully extinguished. Changes in contract liabilities for advance payments in the\nyear reflect the changing level of outstanding customer orders.\nRevenues of EUR 93,079 thousand were realized in 2023 from the EUR 141,237 thousand\nof contract liabilities for advance payments outstanding at the end of 2022. Revenues of\nEUR 60,821 thousand were realized in 2022 from the EUR 77,041 thousand of contract\nliabilities for advance payments outstanding at the end of 2021. In 2023 no revenue was\nrecognized from performance obligations that were settled in prior years.\n162\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources\nof Estimation and Uncertainty\nThe preparation of AIXTRON’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that the Group believes are\nreasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions\naffect the reported amounts and related disclosures and are made in order to fairly\npresent the Group’s financial position and results of operations. The following accounting\npolicies are significantly impacted by these estimates and judgments that AIXTRON\nbelieves are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported\nfinancial results:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue for the supply of most equipment to customers is generally recognized in two\nstages, partly on delivery and partly on final installation and acceptance (see note 2 (N)).\nWhen allocating the transaction price to the two performance obligations, delivery of the\ntool and installation of the tool, assumptions are made regarding individual margins as\npart of the cost-plus method. The Group believes, based on past experience, that this\nmethod of recognizing revenue fairly states the revenues of the Group. For the reporting\nperiods 2023 and 2022, 10% of the installation revenue was allocated to installation\nperformance.\n169\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe judgements made by management include an assessment of the point at which\ncontrol has passed to the customer.\nValuation of Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This requires the\nGroup to make judgments concerning obsolescence of materials. This evaluation requires\nestimates, including both forecasted product demand and pricing environment, both of\nwhich may be susceptible to significant change. The carrying amount of inventories and\ndetails on impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses in the fiscal year are\ndisclosed in notes 3 and 15. In future periods, impairment losses may be necessary due to\nvarious factors such as decreasing product demand or technological obsolescence. These\nfactors could result in adjustment to the valuation of inventory in future periods, and\nsignificantly impact the Group’s future operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether the realization of future tax\nbenefits is sufficiently probable to recognize deferred tax assets. This assessment requires\nthe exercise of judgement on the part of management with respect to future taxable\nincome. The parent company AIXTRON SE does generally not exceed a planning horizon\nof twelve months. The recorded amount of total deferred tax assets could be reduced or\nincreased if estimates of projected future taxable income are lowered or increased, or if\nchanges in current tax regulations are enacted that impose restrictions on the timing or\nextent of the Group’s ability to utilize future tax benefits. The carrying amount of\ndeferred tax assets is disclosed in note 14.\nProvisions\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. At each balance sheet date, the\nGroup assesses the valuation of the liabilities which have been recorded as provisions and\nadjusts them if necessary. Because of the uncertain nature of the timing or amounts of\nprovisions, judgement has to be exercised by the Group with respect to their valuation.\nActual liabilities may differ from the estimated amounts. Details of provisions are shown\nin note 23.\nLegal proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and\nclaims. The Company, based upon advice from legal counsel, believes that the matters\nthe Group is aware of are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition or results of operations. The Group is not aware of any unasserted claims that\nmay have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation.\nSignificant external influences\nThe global impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on business operations is explained in the\ncombined management report. The impact on the 2023 consolidated financial statements\nis immaterial and it is also expected that the impact on fiscal year 2024 will be immaterial.\nClimate risks also did not have a material impact on the business operations of AIXTRON.\n170\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n37.

In addition, we have audited the management\nreport of the Company and the Group (combined management report) of AIXTRON SE for\nthe financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\nIn accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those\ncomponents of the combined management report specified in the \"Other Information\"\nsection of our auditor's report.\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects,\nwith the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German\nCommercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair\nview of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31,\n2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to\nDecember 31, 2023, and\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an\nappropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined\nmanagement report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,\ncomplies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the\nopportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined\nmanagement report does not cover the content of those components of the\ncombined management report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of the\nauditor's report.\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any\nreservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and\nof the combined management report.\n173\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nBasis for the Opinions\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined\nmanagement report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No\n537/2014 (referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with\nGerman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the\nInstitut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We\nperformed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary\ncompliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under\nthose requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the\nCombined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of\nthe group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German\ncommercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with\nArticle 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-\naudit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that\nthe evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\nopinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most\nsignificance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year\nfrom January 1 to December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of\nour audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion\nthereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nExistence of revenues and revenue recognition cut-off for spare parts\nPlease refer to Note 2 (N) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions used. For a\nbreakdown of revenues, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\nThe Company generated revenues from spare parts of EUR 92.3 million in the financial\nyear from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\nAIXTRON recognizes revenues when (or as) it fulfils a performance obligation through the\ntransfer of a promised asset to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the\ncustomer obtains control of that asset. Revenues from spare parts are recognized solely\nat a point in time.\nRevenues from spare parts are based on a large number of business transactions.\nRevenues are one of the Group's most important indicators of target achievement and\nadditionally form a significant basis for decisions for the users of financial statements.\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that revenues from spare parts\nare recognized without actual performance having been rendered. Further, there is the\n174\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nrisk that revenues from spare parts are recognized in 2023, even though the services\nwere not rendered in 2023.\nOUR AUDIT APPROACH\nIn order to examine the recognition of revenues from spare parts, we assessed the\ndesign, setup and effectiveness of internal controls relating to order acceptance, outgoing\ngoods and invoicing, in particular the determination and verification of the actual transfer\nof control.\nIn addition, on the basis of a mathematical and statistical procedure we selected revenue\ntransactions in spare parts that were recorded in financial year 2023 and evaluated these\nby reconciling them with the underlying invoices and external delivery records.\nIn order to evaluate the recognition of revenues on an accrual basis, we assessed the\napplicable point in time and the amount of revenues recognized by reconciling invoices to\nthe related external delivery records. The basis for this were revenues that were selected\nusing a mathematical and statistical procedure which were recognized in a set period\nbefore the year-end closing date. Based on risk, we examined the credits issued for a\ncertain period after the closing date and evaluated whether these required further\nevaluation in respect of the matching principle.\nOUR OBSERVATIONS\nThe procedure used for the recognition of revenues and the revenue recognition cut-off\nfor spare parts is appropriate.\nOther Information\nThe Executive Board and/or the Supervisory Board are/is responsible for the other\ninformation. The other information comprises the following components of the combined\nmanagement report, whose content was not audited:\n• the Group's separate non-financial statement, which is referred to in the combined\nmanagement report,\n• the combined corporate governance statement for the Company and the Group\nreferred to in the combined management report, and\n• information extraneous to combined management reports and marked as\nunaudited.\nThe other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report. The other\ninformation does not include the consolidated financial statements, the combined\nmanagement report information audited for content and our auditor's report thereon.\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so\ndoing, to consider whether the other information\n175\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the\ncombined management report information audited for content or our knowledge\nobtained in the audit, or\n• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material\nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have\nnothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the\nadditional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and\nthat the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a\ntrue and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of\nthe Group. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as it\nhas determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nthat are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial\nreporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for\nassessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility\nfor disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, the Executive\nBoard is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of\naccounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or\nthere is no realistic alternative but to do so.\nFurthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the combined\nmanagement report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s\nposition and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the\nopportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board is\nresponsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary\nto enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with\nthe applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient\nappropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting\nprocess for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined\nmanagement report.\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nand of the Combined Management Report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an\nappropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with\n176\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nthe consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies\nwith the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and\nrisks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our\nopinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit\nconducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in\ncompliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits\npromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and supplementary compliance\nwith the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of\nthese consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the\naudit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The\nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the\nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override\nof internal controls.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the\naudit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Executive Board and\nthe reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board and related\ndisclosures.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern\nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on\nthe Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined\nmanagement report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective\nopinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date\nof our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group\nto cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner\nthat the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,\n177\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nliabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance\nwith IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of\nthe entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We\nremain solely responsible for our opinions.\n• Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated\nfinancial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's\nposition it provides.\n• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the\nExecutive Board in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient\nappropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions\nused by the Executive Board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate\nthe proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We\ndo not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the\nassumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future\nevents will differ materially from the prospective information.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,\nthe planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any\nsignificant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied\nwith the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all\nrelationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our\nindependence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate\nindependence threats.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine\nthose matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe\nthese matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure\nabout the matter.\nOther Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report Prepared for\nPublication Purposes in Accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the combined management report „aix-2023-12-31-de.zip“ (SHA256-\nHashwert: 33d1fdbf185b62908f38862ddb4cee311584c4df242a884e73aa0d990d4633a1)\nmade available and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects\n178\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nwith the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF\nformat\").

On that basis,\nAIXTRON confirms the annual guidance for 2023 in all areas.\nOrder intake in the first nine months of 2023 was on very high levels at EUR 436.2 million,\naround 2% higher compared to the same period of the previous year (9M/2022:\nEUR 425.6 million). The equipment order backlog as of September 30, 2023 was stable on\nprevious years´ level at around EUR 368.0 million (September 30, 2022:\nEUR 369.4 million).\nAt EUR 415.7 million, revenues in the first nine months of 2023 were significantly higher\nand increased by 49% compared to the previous year (9M/2022: EUR 279.9 million). With\nthat, we generated a gross profit in the first nine months of 2023 of EUR 180.8 million\n(9M/2022: EUR 113.1 million) at an also significantly higher gross margin of 43%\ncompared to last year`s period (9M/2022: 40%). This resulted in an operating result\n(EBIT) of EUR 93.4 million and an EBIT margin of 22% (9M/2022: EUR 47.6 million, 17%).\nThe profit for the period in the first nine months of 2023 amounted to EUR 83.5 million\n(9M/2022: EUR 50.2 million).\nDue to the unabated strong demand, the Executive Board expects further significant\ngrowth with increasing revenues, margins and orders for the remainder of the financial\nyear. The guidance for FY/2023 is therefore reiterated in all metrics. With expected\norder intake at a range from EUR 620 million and EUR 700 million, expected revenues\nbetween EUR 600 million and EUR 660 million, expected gross margin at around 45% and\nan expected EBIT margin at around 25% to 27%.\nAt EUR 118.5 million, order intake in Q3/2023 came in below the level of the previous\nquarter (Q2/2023: EUR 177.8 million; Q3/2022: EUR 142.8 million). Demand, particularly\nfor efficient power electronics, remains consistently high and AIXTRON confirms its full\nyear guidance. Therefore, a correspondingly higher order intake is expected for the fourth\nquarter.\nRevenues in Q3/2023 came in at EUR 165.0 million and with that, significantly stronger\nthan last year´s quarter (Q2/2023: EUR 173.5 million; Q2/2022: EUR 88.9 million). Gross\nprofit in Q3/2023 was EUR 76.2 million with a gross margin of 46% (Q3/2022:\nEUR 39.3 million, 44%; Q2/2023: EUR 73.5 million, 42%).\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nAt EUR 30.9 million, operating expenses in Q3/2023 were higher than the corresponding\nfigure of the previous year (Q3/2022: EUR 23.1 million; Q2/2023: EUR 28.9 million) mainly\ndue to higher R&D spending. With an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 45.3 million and an\nEBIT margin of 27% (Q3/2022: EUR 16.2 million, 18%; Q2/2023: EUR 44.6 million, 26%),\nprofit for the period in the third quarter 2023 amounted to EUR 39.6 million (Q3/2022:\nEUR 19.1 million; Q2/2023: EUR 40.4 million).\nFree cash flow in Q3/2023 was EUR -2.2 million (Q3/2022: EUR -7.2 million; Q2/2023:\nEUR -82.0 million). This development is primarily due to an increase in inventories in\npreparation for corresponding business volumes in the following quarters.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including other current financial assets of\nEUR 209.9 million as of September 30, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 325.2 million). The\nequity ratio at September 30, 2023 was 76% (December 31, 2022: 73%).\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2022. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2022 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n9M 2023 9M 2022 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 436.2 425.6 10.6 2\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 368.0 369.4 -1.4 0\nOrder intake for the first nine months of 2023 increased by 2% year-on-year to EUR 436.2\nmillion (9M/2022: EUR 425.6 million). This reflects the unabated strong demand, in\nparticular for efficient power electronics based on the material systems gallium nitride\n(GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). At EUR 118.5 million in the third quarter 2023, order\nintake was below the level of the previous year and the previous quarter (Q3/2022: EUR\n142.8 million; Q2/2023: EUR 177.8 million). In view of the confirmed full-year guidance, it\nis expected that order intake will be correspondingly higher in the fourth quarter.\nThe total equipment order backlog as of September 30, 2023 was at EUR 368.0 million on\na comparable level to the previous year (September 30, 2022: EUR 369.4 million).\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 was 1.08 USD/EUR\n(Q1/2023: 1.07 USD/EUR; Q2/2023: 1.09 USD/EUR; Q3/2023: 1.09 USD/EUR) against 1.08\nUSD/EUR in 9M/2022. Compared to the previous year's average, the US dollar exchange\nrate remained almost unchanged.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 amounted to EUR 415.7\nmillion and were EUR 135.8 million or 49% higher year-on-year (9M/2022: EUR 279.9\nmillion). This is mainly due to the increasing demand for systems for the production of\ncomponents based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). At EUR 165.0\nmillion revenues came in once again at a high level (Q3/2022: EUR 88.9 million; Q2/2023:\nEUR 173.5 million).\nIn the first nine months of 2023, 82% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics, with SiC applications accounting for the largest share. A\nfurther revenue share of 11% was contributed by the business with systems for\noptoelectronics, in particular for the production of lasers for optical data transmission\nand 3D sensing technology. The area of LEDs accounted for 6% of equipment revenues in\n9M/2023.\nEquipment revenues in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 were EUR 347.6 million,\nrepresenting 84% of the total revenues in the period (9M/2022: EUR 218.4 million; 78%).\nIn the third quarter 2023, equipment sales amounted to EUR 141.8 million or 86% of sales\n(Q3/2022: EUR 69.7 million, 78% of sales; Q2/2023: EUR 149.4 million, 86% of sales).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the after sales business with the sale of\nconsumables, spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n9M 2023 9M 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 347.6 84 218.4 78 129.2 59\nRevenues from service,\n68.1 16 61.6 22 6.5 11\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 415.7 100 279.9 100 135.8 49\nRevenues by Region\n9M 2023 9M 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 181.3 44 185.8 66 -4.5 -2\nEurope 139.1 33 45.8 16 93.3 204\nAmericas 95.3 23 48.4 17 46.9 97\nTotal 415.7 100 279.9 100 135.8 49\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n9M 2023 9M 2022 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

This development was mainly due to higher R&D expenses\nand higher personnel costs compared to the previous year due to the increase in\nheadcount.\nR&D expenses increased, mainly due to the ongoing further development of existing\nsystem generations such as the G10 product family, which has now been fully launched\non the market, as well as the simultaneous development of new tool generations in the\nfirst nine months of 2023 increased by EUR 18.4 million to EUR 59.8 million (9M/2022:\nEUR 41.4 million; Q3/2023: EUR 20.8 million; Q2/2023: EUR 19.8 million).\nKey R&D Information\n9M 2023 9M 2022 +/-\nR&D expenses (in EUR million) 59.8 41.4 44%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 14 15 -1 pp\nNet other operating income and expenses resulted in an operating income of EUR 6.7\nmillion in 9M/2023 (9M/2022: operating income of EUR 4.6 million; Q3/2023: operating\nincome of EUR 1.1 million; Q2/2023: operating income of EUR 3.0 million).

This development essentially results from the business and cost development\ndescribed above.\nThe result before taxes in the first nine months of 2023 was EUR 93.9 million (9M/2022:\nEUR 47.8 million; Q3/2023: EUR 45.5 million; Q2/2023: EUR 44.8 million).\nThe tax expense in 9M/2023 was EUR 10.4 million (9M/2022: tax income of EUR 2.4\nmillion; Q3/2023: tax expense EUR 5.9 million; Q2/2023: tax expense of EUR 4.4 million).\nThis consists of a tax expense from current taxes of EUR 12.2m (9M/2022:\nEUR 7.2 million) and a tax income from the capitalization of deferred taxes on loss\ncarryforwards of EUR 1.9 million (9M/2022: EUR 9.6 million) due to expected future\nprofits.\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first nine months of 2023 significantly\nincreased to EUR 83.5 million (9M/2022: EUR 50.2 million; Q3/2023: EUR 39.6 million;\nQ2/2023: EUR 40.4 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of September 30, 2023 as well as\nDecember 31, 2022.\nTotal equity as of September 30, 2023, increased to EUR 716.6 million compared to EUR\n663.3 million as of December 31, 2022. The main influencing factors were the profit for\nthe period. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2023, was 76% compared to 73% as at\n31 December 2022.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets decreased to EUR 209.9 million\nas of September 30, 2023, compared to EUR 325.2 million as of December 31, 2022. This\nis mainly due to the increase in inventories and the dividend payment in May 2023. In the\nfirst nine months of 2023, EUR 30.0 million was invested in fund investments and fund\ninvestments worth EUR 120.9 million were sold. Other current financial assets as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, now include total fund investments of EUR 132.9 million (December\n31, 2022: EUR 220.4 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of September 30, 2023, increased\nslightly to EUR 106.2 million compared to EUR 99.0 million as of December 31, 2022.\nCapital expenditures in the fiscal year mainly included laboratory equipment, demo\nlaboratory facilities as well as first investments into the new innovation center and\nproduction site expansions.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.8 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to EUR\n72.5 million as of December 31, 2022. There were no indications of a need for impairment\nin the first nine months of 2023. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2022\nare attributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to EUR\n380.5 million as of September 30, 2023, compared to EUR 223.6 million as of December\n31, 2022. This development is related to the inventory build-up in preparation for the\nhigher expected business volumes in the upcoming quarters.\nTrade receivables as of September 30, 2023, amounted to EUR 107.0 million (December\n31, 2022: EUR 119.7 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in\nQ3/2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The average day’s sales outstanding of\nreceivables were 50 days (December 31, 2022: 26 days).\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 125.5 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, slightly below the level of EUR 141.2 million as of December 31,\n2022 which was mainly due to the high number of deliveries in 2023.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR -82.3 million in first nine months of 2023 (9M/2022: EUR\n20.4 million; Q3/2023: EUR -2.2 million; Q2/2023: EUR -82.0 million). Significant cash\nflows in the first nine months of 2023 resulted from outflows to increase inventories in\npreparation of the planned revenue growth in the coming quarters.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first nine months of 2023, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2022.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2022 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the good business development in the first nine months of 2023 and driven by the\ncontinued very positive assessment of the development of demand, Management\nreiterates the growth guidance for 2023 in all metrics.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board reiterates their expectation for financial year 2023 to\nachieve an order intake in a range between EUR 620 million and EUR 700 million,\nrevenues between EUR 600 million and EUR 660 million, at a gross margin of around 45%\nand an EBIT margin of about 25% to 27% of revenues.\nFurther details on the previous annual guidance can be found in the “Expected\nDevelopments” section of the Annual Report 2022.

The demand\nfor these systems continues to increase as expected. In addition to a high demand for\nsystems for the production of components based on gallium nitride (GaN), there is a\nfurther increase in demand from the area of silicon carbide (SiC) power electronics.\nOrder intake in the first six months of 2023 was EUR 317.7 million, around 12% higher\nthan in the same period of the previous year (H1/2022: EUR 282.8 million). The\nequipment order backlog as of June 30, 2023 has increased to EUR 412.5 million (June\n30, 2022: EUR 314.4 million).\nAt EUR 250.7 million, revenues in the first six months of 2023 were 31% higher compared\nto the previous year (H1/2022: EUR 191.1 million). In the second quarter 2023, revenues\nof EUR 173.5 million were around 69% above the revenues of the same quarter of the\nprevious year (Q2/2022: EUR 102.5 million). This is partially due to the fact that a large\npart of long-outstanding export licenses were granted and the corresponding systems\nwere delivered. In line with revenues, the gross profit of the in the first six months of\n2023 amounted to EUR 104.6 million (H1/2022: EUR 73.7 million) at a significantly higher\ngross margin of 42% compared to last year`s period (H1/2022: 39%).\nDue to the continuous strong demand, the Management Board expects further\nsignificant growth with increasing margins and orders for the remainder of the financial\nyear. The guidance for FY/2023 is therefore increased as follows: Expected order intake\nnow range from EUR 620 million and EUR 700 million (previously: between\nEUR 600 million and EUR 680 million); expected revenues between EUR 600 million and\nEUR 660 million (previously: between EUR 580 million and EUR 640 million); expected\ngross margin as before about 45%; expected EBIT margin as before around 25% to 27%.\nAt EUR 177.8 million, order intake in Q2/2023 significantly exceeded the level of the\nstrong previous quarter (Q1/2023: EUR 139.9 million) and the same quarter of the\nprevious year (Q2/2022: EUR 152.6 million). The order intake in the second quarter of\n2023 is the highest quarterly order intake in the company's history since 2011. This\ndevelopment is particularly due to the very encouraging demand from the area of power\nelectronics based on GaN and SiC.\nDue to the reasons mentioned above, revenues in Q2/2023 were EUR 173.5 million\n(Q1/2023: EUR 77.2 million; Q2/2022: EUR 102.5 million). Gross profit in Q2/2023 was\nEUR 73.5 million with a gross margin of 42% (Q1/2023: EUR 31.1 million, 40%; Q2/2022:\nEUR 37.8 million, 37%).\n4\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nAIXTRON GROUP\nAt EUR 28.8 million, operating expenses in Q2/2023 were higher than the corresponding\nfigure of the previous year (Q2/2022: EUR 20.6m) mainly due to higher R&D spending.\nWith an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 44.6 million and an EBIT margin of 26% (Q2/2022:\nEUR 17.2 million, 17%), profit for the period in the second quarter 2023 amounted to\nEUR 40.4 million (Q2/2022: EUR 17.3 million).\nFree cash flow in Q2/2023 was EUR -82.0 million (Q2/2022: EUR 5.1 million). This\ndevelopment is primarily driven by an increase in inventories and trade receivables with a\nsimultaneous decrease in advance payments received for customer orders and trade\npayables.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including other current financial assets of\nEUR 210.4 million as of June 30, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 325.2 million) which is\nmainly due to increased inventories. The equity ratio at June 30, 2023 was 75%\n(December 31, 2022: 73%).\n5\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2022. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first six months of fiscal year 2023. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2022 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEconomic Report\nMacroeconomic developments\nThe situation for the global economy remains tense in the first half of 2023. The main\ndrivers are high inflation and economic uncertainty, partly due to the war in Ukraine.\nAdded to this are the increasingly visible consequences of rising interest rates, which on\nthe one hand are having an initial positive impact on inflation, but on the other are\ndampening investment demand and weighing on the financial markets.\nIn this environment, the IMF again slightly reduced the growth forecasts for the current\nyear in its World Economic Outlook of April 2023. For 2023 as a whole, the IMF now\nexpects growth in global economic output of 2.8% (2022: 3.4%). The expected growth\nrate for the industrialized nations is 1.3% (2022: 2.7%), the growth rate for the emerging\nand developing countries is expected to be 3.9% (2022: 4.0%).1\nThe situation in the heavily export-oriented German mechanical and plant engineering\nsector also deteriorated increasingly over the course of the year. According to reports\nfrom the Association of German Mechanical and Plant Engineering e. V. (VDMA), orders in\nthe three-month period from March to May 2023, which is less susceptible to\nfluctuations, fell by 12% in real terms compared to the previous year. 6% fewer orders\ncame from Germany and 15% fewer orders were booked from abroad. The Euro countries\nremained 23% below the previous year's level, the minus from the non-Euro countries\nwas 11%.2\nThe demand for AIXTRON products continues to depend primarily on industry-specific\ndevelopments, e.g. the introduction of new applications in entertainment electronics, in\nIT infrastructure, in the field of electromobility or the demand in sub-segments of the\nglobal semiconductor market, which – also due to the pandemic intensified trends\ntowards digitization – which continued to be very robust overall.\nThe current global crisis situations as well as market and geopolitical developments\ncontinue to have only a minor impact on our business overall. Logistics and supply chains\nare tense but remain stable overall from our point of view.\nIndustry developments\nLasers that can be manufactured on AIXTRON systems have a wide range of applications\nin the areas of 3D Sensing technology and optical data transmission: According to the\nmarket research company Yole Développement, consumer electronics will be the main\ndriver of demand for lasers in this area over the next few years of 3D Sensing. In addition,\nedge and surface emitting lasers in the field of 3D Sensing technology are increasingly\nbeing used in industry and the automotive sector.\nThe market for lasers for optical data transmission at the speed of light is being\npositively influenced in particular by the increasing use of cloud computing and Internet\nservices such as video-on-demand and music streaming, as well as the communication of\nnetworked devices via the Internet (“Internet-of-Things”).\n1 IMF: World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023\n2VDMA, Auftragseingang im Maschinen- und Anlagenbau, Juli 2023\n7\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe most important growth market for AIXTRON is the area of power electronics: Power\nsemiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials enable the production of\nvery compact and highly efficient converters between direct and alternating current,\nwhich are used in a wide range of applications. These range from low (e.g. power packs\nfor smartphones) to the highest power (e.g. fast charging stations for electric vehicles).\nPower devices based on the material systems silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride\n(GaN) are gaining market share in the overall market for power components with\nincreasing speed. GaN semiconductor devices are mainly used in the low and medium\npower and voltage ranges, such as in high-performance and energy-efficient power\nsupplies for smartphones and laptops, in wireless charging or in power supplies for\nservers and other IT infrastructure. In addition, customers are constantly developing new\napplications, for example in the area of data centers, in IT infrastructure and with micro\ninverters in the field of photovoltaics or mobile charging technology in the field of\nelectromobility. In addition, the customer base for AIXTRON systems for the production\nof GaN semiconductor devices is continuously expanding, while existing customers are\nexpanding their production capacities.\nWBG power devices made of silicon carbide (SiC) are particularly suitable for use in\nhigher power and voltage classes. Areas of application are primarily electric vehicles and\ntheir fast-charging stations, but also converters in the field of photovoltaics, wind energy\nand other electrical drives. In these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in\nconversion losses, which leads to a greater range per battery charge in vehicles and to a\nhigher amount of energy output in the area of energy production. Due to the diverse\napplication possibilities and the high efficiency, industry experts expect strong growth in\nthe coming years for both GaN and SiC devices.\nAccording to LEDinside, the micro LEDs segment represents the greatest growth potential\nin optoelectronics. Potential drivers include large screens and very small displays in\nvarious end applications such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and notebooks.\nMicro LED technology is currently still in the development stage, so estimates of the\nfuture market size by various analysts still differ greatly.\nHowever, according to Yole, further growth is also predicted for the market for red,\norange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) due to the worldwide use of directly emitting, large-\narea LED display walls or backlighting units. Another specialized segment in the LED\nmarket that AIXTRON is addressing is the market for ultraviolet LEDs (UV LEDs). UV LEDs\nare used for curing plastics and for disinfecting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking)\nwater. Due to the increasing need for hygiene, this market is expected to gain importance\nin the future.\nThe growth forecasts for the market segments described here are detailed in the\neconomic report of our 2022 Annual Report. We continue to regard these as valid.\nAccording to the current analysis by the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON has\ndefended its global market leadership for MOCVD systems in 2022. Due to exchange rate\neffects, AIXTRON's market share fell to 70%, followed by AMEC (China) at 18% and Veeco\n(USA) at 12%.\n8\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nH1 2023 H1 2022 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 317.7 282.8 34.9 12\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 412.5 314.4 98.1 31\nOrder intake for the first six months of 2023 increased by 12% year-on-year to EUR 317.7\nmillion (H1/2022: EUR 282.8 million). This reflects the continuing high demand across\nalmost all end markets, but in particular for efficient power electronics based on the\nmaterial systems gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). At EUR 177.8 million in\nthe second quarter 2023, order intake also exceeded the level of the previous year and\nthe previous quarter (Q1/2023: EUR 139.9 million; Q2/2022: EUR 152.6 million).\nThe total equipment order backlog as of June 30, 2023 was EUR 412.5 million, also\nsignificantly higher compared to the previous year (June 30, 2022: EUR 314.4 million).\nAs part of a strict internal process, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in the order intake and order backlog. These\nconditions include the following requirements:\n• the existence of a firm written order,\n• the receipt or security of an agreed down payment,\n• the availability of all documents required for the delivery,\n• the agreement of a delivery date confirmed by the customer.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Executive Board\nreserves the right to check whether the actual implementation of each order within a\nreasonable period of time is also sufficiently probable. If, as part of this review, the\nExecutive Board comes to the conclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently\nprobable or involves an excessively high risk, this specific order or a part of this order is\nnot included in the order intake or so long from recording excluded from order intake and\norder backlog until risk is reduced to an acceptable level. The order backlog is regularly\nevaluated and – if necessary – adjusted according to possible delivery risks.\n9\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first six months of fiscal year 2023 was 1.08 USD/EUR\n(Q1/2023: 1.07 USD/EUR, Q2/2023: 1.09 USD/EUR) against 1.10 USD/EUR in H1/2022.\nThus, compared to the same period of the previous year, the US dollar value increased by\n2% in H1/2023, having a corresponding positive impact on AIXTRON Group’s US dollar\ndenominated revenues in the period.\n10\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first six months of fiscal year 2023 amounted to EUR 250.7 million\nand were EUR 59.6 million or 31% higher year-on-year (H1/2022: EUR 191.1 million). This\nis mainly due to the increasing demand for systems for the production of components\nbased on gallium nitride (GaN) and from the silicon carbide (SiC) sector. Compared to the\nprevious quarter, revenues in the second quarter 2023 increased by 125% to EUR 173.5\nmillion (Q1/2023: EUR 77.2 million; Q2/2022: EUR 102.5 million). In addition to the\nincrease in demand described above, this was also due to the fact that a large part of the\nexport licenses still outstanding in the previous quarter have now been issued and the\ncorresponding equipment has been delivered.\nIn the first six months of 2023, 83% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics, with SiC applications accounting for the largest share. A\nfurther revenue share of 12% was contributed by the business with systems for\noptoelectronics, in particular for the production of lasers for optical data transmission\nand 3D sensing technology. The area of LEDs accounted for 5% of equipment revenues in\nH1/2023.\nEquipment revenues in the first six months of fiscal year 2023 were EUR 205.8 million,\nrepresenting 82% of the total revenues in the period (H1/2022: EUR 148.6 million; 78%).\nIn the second quarter 2023, equipment sales amounted to EUR 149.4 million or 86% of\nsales (Q1/2023: EUR 56.4 million, 73% of sales; Q2/2022: EUR 82.3 million, 80% of sales).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the after sales business with the sale of\nconsumables, spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nH1 2023 H1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 205.8 82 148.6 78 57.2 38\nRevenues from service,\n44.9 18 42.4 22 2.5 6\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 250.7 100 191.1 100 59.6 31\nRevenues by Region\nH1 2023 H1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 125.4 50 133.2 70 -7.8 -6\nEurope 72.6 29 30.5 16 42.1 138\nAmericas 52.7 21 27.3 14 25.4 93\nTotal 250.7 100 191.1 100 59.6 31\n11\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nH1 2023 H1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

In the previous\nyear, gross profit was significantly influenced by the delivery of equipment for the\nproduction of traditional red LEDs, which have a comparatively low margin.\nOperating expenses of EUR 56.5 million increased in the first six months of 2023\ncompared to the previous year (H1/2022: EUR 42.3 million; Q2/2023: EUR 28.9 million;\nQ1/2023: EUR 27.6 million). This development was mainly due to higher R&D expenses\nand higher personnel costs compared to the previous year due to the increase in\npersonnel. Compared to Q1/2023, operating expenses in Q2/2023 increased by EUR 1.3\nmillion.\nR&D expenses for the further development of existing and development of new tool\ngenerations in the first six months of 2023 increased by EUR 11.7 million to EUR 39.0\nmillion (H1/2022: EUR 27.3 million).

This\ndevelopment essentially results from the business and cost development described\nabove.\nThe result before taxes in the first six months of 2023 was EUR 48.4 million (H1/2022:\nEUR 31.4 million; Q2/2023: EUR 44.8 million; Q1/2023: EUR 3.6 million).\nThe tax expense in H1/2023 was EUR 4.5 million (H1/2022: tax expense of EUR 0.3\nmillion; Q2/2023: tax expense EUR 4.4 million; Q1/2023: tax expense of EUR 0.1 million).\nThis consists of a tax expense from current taxes of EUR 6.0 million (H1/2022: EUR 4.1\nmillion) and a tax income from the capitalization of deferred taxes on loss carryforwards\nof EUR 1.5 million (H1/2022: EUR 3.8 million) due to expected future profits.\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first six months of 2023 significantly increased\nto EUR 43.9 million (H1/2022: EUR 31.1 million; Q2/2023: EUR 40.4 million; Q1/2023:\nEUR 3.5 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of June 30, 2023 as well as December\n31, 2022.\nTotal equity as of June 30, 2023, increased to EUR 674.7 million compared to EUR 663.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The main influencing factors were the profit for the\nperiod. The equity ratio as of June 30, 2023, was 75% compared to 73% as at 31\nDecember 2022.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets decreased to EUR 210.4 million\nas of June 30, 2023, compared to EUR 325.2 million as of December 31, 2022. This is\nmainly due to the increase in inventories and the dividend payment in May 2023. In\nQ1/2023, EUR 15.0 million was invested in fund investments and in Q2/2023, fund\ninvestments worth EUR 104.2 million were sold. Other current financial assets as of June\n30, 2023, now include total fund investments of EUR 132.7 million (December 31, 2022:\nEUR 220.4 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of June 30, 2023, increased slightly\nto EUR 102.3 million compared to EUR 99.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Capital\nexpenditures in the fiscal year mainly included laboratory equipment, demo laboratory\nequipment as well as production site expansions.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.5 million as of June 30, 2023, compared to EUR 72.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. There were no indications of a need for impairment in\nthe first six months of 2023. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2022 are\nattributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\n13\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to EUR\n332.8 million as of June 30, 2023, compared to EUR 223.6 million as of December 31,\n2022. This development is related to the inventory build-up in preparation for the higher\nexpected business volumes in the upcoming quarters and, to a lesser extent, to export\nlicenses for the delivery of finished systems not yet available at the end of the quarter.\nTrade receivables as of June 30, 2023, amounted to EUR 115.2 million (December 31,\n2022: EUR 119.7 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in Q2/2023\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The average day’s sales outstanding of\nreceivables were 30 days (December 31, 2022: 26 days).\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 139.3 million as of June 30,\n2023, mainly due to the high number of deliveries at the end of Q2/2023 and slightly\nbelow the level of EUR 141.2 million as of December 31, 2022.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR -80.1 million in first six months of 2023 (H1/2022: EUR\n27.5 million; Q2/2023: EUR -82.0 million; Q1/2023: EUR 1.9 million). Significant cash flows\nin the first six months of 2023 resulted from outflows to increase inventories in\npreparation of the planned revenue growth in the second half of 2023.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first six months of 2023, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2022. The risks arising from the current global crisis situations and\nmarket- and geopolitical developments continue to be assessed as not significant because\nit has been shown that demand for our products has not been significantly affected and\nour supply chains, although strained, are nevertheless functioning reliably.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2022 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\nIn particular, AIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the\nrelevant end user markets could possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term:\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based components for energy-efficient\npower electronics devices in cars, consumer electronics, mobile devices and IT\ninfrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaN-based devices in 5G network infrastructure\n14\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based devices in mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) for 5G\nmobile communications or 6E WLAN technology\n• Further increase in demand for lasers for optical data transmission of large volumes,\nsuch as video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing adoption of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensor systems\nin mobile devices as well as sensors for infrastructure applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) for\ndisplays and other applications\n• Commercialization of Micro LED display technology\nMid- to Long-Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated power\nmanagement\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual-light communication\ntechnology or Micro LED displays\n• Increased use of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for autonomous\ndriving\n• Use of GaN-based devices in mobile terminals (e.g., smartphones) for the millimeter-\nwave range of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Increased development activities for high performance solar cells made of\ncompound semiconductor\n15\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the good business development in the first six months of 2023 and driven by the\ncontinued very positive assessment of the development of demand, Management\nincreases the growth guidance for 2023.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board now expects the order intake in a range between EUR\n620 million and EUR 700 million for the year 2023 (from previously between EUR 600\nmillion and EUR 680 million). With revenues now in a range of EUR 600 million and EUR\n660 million (from previously between EUR 580 million and EUR 640 million), the\nExecutive Board continues to expect a gross margin of around 45% and an EBIT margin of\nabout 25% to 27% of revenues.\nFurther details on the previous annual guidance can be found in the “Expected\nDevelopments” section of the Annual Report 2022, which is available on the Company‘s\nwebsite at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n16\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENT\nCONDENSED INTERIM

In particular, systems for the production of efficient power\nelectronics based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are extremely\npopular, which is reflected in an ever increasing order intake. In addition, orders for\nsystems for micro LED and lasers as well as the after-sales business contributed to the\nhigh overall demand.\nThe Q1/2023 order intake of EUR 139.9 million reflects continuous demand for our tools\nat a very high level, 7% above the order intake in the same period of the previous year\n(Q1/2022: EUR 130.2 million). The equipment order backlog as of March 31, 2023, has\nincreased to EUR 417.9 million (Q1/2022: EUR 260.4 million).\nRevenues in the first quarter of 2023 at EUR 77.2 million were below the prior-year\nquarter (Q1/2022: EUR 88.6 million). This development was driven by the fact that export\nlicenses for systems that are ready for delivery were not yet available as of the reporting\ndate.\nDue to the unabated strong demand and stable supply chains, Management expects\nfurther significant growth with increasing margins and order intake for the entire financial\nyear and therefore confirms the 2023 guidance, announced in February.\nIn line with revenues, the gross profit of the first quarter of 2023 amounted to\nEUR 31.1 million (Q1/2022: EUR 35.9 million) at a gross margin of 40% (Q1/2022: 41%).\nAt EUR 27.6 million, operating expenses in Q1/2023 were higher than the corresponding\nfigure of the previous year (Q1/2022: EUR 21.7 million) mainly due to higher R&D\nspending. With an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 3.5 million and an EBIT margin of 5%\n(Q1/2022: EUR 14.2 million, 16%), profit for the period in the first quarter of 2023\namounted to EUR 3.5 million (Q1/2022: EUR 13.8 million).\nFree cash flow in Q1 2023 was EUR 1.9 million (Q1/2022: EUR 22.4 million). The deviation\nfrom the previous quarter was primarily driven by the lower profit for the period and the\nincrease in inventories.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including other current financial assets of\nEUR 327.5 million as of March 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 325.2 million). The\nequity ratio at March 31, 2023 was 72% (December 31, 2022: 73%).\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2022. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first three months of fiscal year 2023. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2022 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nQ1 2023 Q1 2022 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 139.9 130.2 9.7 7\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 417.9 260.4 157.5 60\nOrder intake for the first quarter of 2023 increased by 7% year-on-year to EUR 139.9\nmillion (Q1/2022: EUR 130.2 million). This reflects the unabated high demand across\nalmost all end markets, but in particular for efficient power electronics based on the\nmaterial systems gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC).\nThe total equipment order backlog as of March 31, 2023 was EUR 417.9 million, also\nsignificantly higher compared to the previous year (March 31, 2022: EUR 260.4 million).\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first three months of fiscal year 2023 was 1.07 USD/EUR\n(Q1/2022: 1.13 USD/EUR). Thus, compared to the same period of the previous year, the\nUS dollar value increased by 5% in Q1/2023, having a corresponding positive impact on\nAIXTRON Group’s US dollar denominated revenues and results in the period.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first three months of fiscal year 2023 amounted to EUR 77.2\nmillion and were EUR 11.4 million or 13% lower year-on-year (Q1/2022: EUR 88.6\nmillion). This is mainly related to the fact that export licenses for systems that are ready\nfor delivery were not yet available as of the reporting date.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, 64% of equipment revenues were generated with equipment\nfor power electronics, with SiC applications accounting for the largest share. Another\nsignificant revenue share of 23% was contributed by the business with systems for\noptoelectronics, in particular for the production of lasers for optical data transmission\nand 3D sensing technology.\nEquipment revenues in the first three months of fiscal year 2023 were EUR 56.4 million,\nrepresenting 73% of the total revenues in the period (Q1/2022: EUR 66.3 million; 75%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nQ1 2023 Q1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 56.4 73 66.3 75 -9.9 -15\nRevenues from service,\n20.8 27 22.3 25 -1.5 -7\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 77.2 100 88.6 100 -11.4 -13\nRevenues by Region\nQ1 2023 Q1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 36.2 47 59.6 67 -23.4 -39\nEurope 21.6 28 19.2 22 2.4 13\nAmericas 19.4 25 9.7 11 9.7 100\nTotal 77.2 100 88.6 100 -11.4 -13\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nQ1 2023 Q1 2022 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

This reflects the\nincome from fund investments in the amount EUR 1.3 million (Q1/2022: expense EUR 0.9\nmillion) and R&D grants of EUR 0.9 million (Q1 2022: EUR 1.7 million).\nThe operating result (EBIT) declined year-on-year from EUR 14.2 million in Q1/2022 to\nEUR 3.5 million in Q1/2023 (Q4/2022: EUR 57.1 million). This development essentially\nresults from the business and cost development described above.\nThe result before taxes in the first three months of 2023 was EUR 3.6 million (Q1/2022:\nEUR 14.3 million; Q4/2022: EUR 57.3 million).\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDue to the development of earnings in the first three months of 2023, the tax expense of\nEUR 0.1 million was lower than in the prior year (Q1/2022: tax expense of EUR 0.5 million,\nQ4/2022: tax expense of EUR 7.1 million).\nThe Company’s profit for the period in the first three months of 2023 amounted to EUR\n3.5 million (Q1/2022: EUR 13.8 million; Q4/2022: EUR 50.3 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of March 31, 2023 as well as\nDecember 31, 2022.\nTotal equity as of March 31, 2023, increased to EUR 667.7 million compared to EUR 663.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The main influencing factors were the profit for the\nperiod. The equity ratio as of March 31, 2023, was 72% compared to 73% as at 31\nDecember 2022 mainly due to the higher balance sheet total resulting from increased\ncustomer prepayments.\nCash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets increased to EUR 327.5 million\nas of March 31, 2023, compared to EUR 325.2 million as of December 31, 2022. In the\nfirst quarter, the inflows of trade receivables and advance payments from customers\nwere almost fully offset by outflows related to the increase in inventories. In the first\nquarter of 2023, EUR 15.0 million were invested in funds. Other current financial assets\nas of March 31, 2023, now include total fund investments of EUR 236.6 million\n(December 31, 2022: EUR 220.4 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment, and leased assets as of March 31, 2023, increased to\nEUR 99.1 million compared to EUR 99.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Capital\nexpenditures in the fiscal year mainly included laboratory equipment and lab as well as\nproduction site expansions.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.4 million as of March 31, 2023, compared to EUR 72.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. There were no indications of impairment in the first\nthree months of 2023. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2022 are\nattributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to\nEUR 295.0 million as of March 31, 2023, compared to EUR 223.6 million as of December\n31, 2022. This development is related to inventory build-up in preparation for the higher\nexpected business volumes in the upcoming quarters as well as to a lesser extent to\nstockpiling reflecting the fact that export licenses for systems that are ready for delivery\nwere not yet available as of the reporting date.\nTrade receivables as of March 31, 2023, amounted to EUR 62.5 million (December 31,\n2022: EUR 119.7 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in the first\nquarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The average day’s sales\noutstanding of receivables were 56 days (December 31, 2022: 30 days).\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nContract liabilities for advance payments amounted to EUR 162.3 million as of March 31,\n2023, compared to EUR 141.2 million as of December 31, 2022, thus reflecting the\ncurrent order situation.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property plant &\nequipment as well as in intangible assets and non-current financial assets + proceeds\nfrom disposals) came in at EUR 1.9 million in first three months of 2023 (Q1/2022: EUR\n22.4 million; Q4/2022: EUR -12.7 million). Significant cash flows in the first quarter of\n2023 resulted from inflows of trade receivables and advance payments from customers as\nwell as outflows from the build-up of inventories.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first three months of 2023, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2022. The risks arising from the current global crisis situations and\nmarket developments continue to be assessed as not significant because it has been\nshown that demand for our products has not been significantly affected and our supply\nchains, although strained, are nevertheless functioning reliably.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2022 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2023\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the continued positive assessment of the development of demand, the Executive\nBoard reiterates its growth guidance for 2023.\nAccordingly, Management expects total order intake for 2023 in a range between EUR\n600 million and EUR 680 million. With revenues between EUR 580 million and EUR 640\nmillion, the Executive Board expects to achieve a gross margin of around 45% at an EBIT\nmargin of around 25% to 27%.\nFurther details on the annual guidance can be found in the “Expected Developments”\nsection of the Annual Report 2022, which is available on the Company‘s website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON

The Company’s high-\ntech solutions are used by a broad range of customers for the manufacture of high-\nperformance and optoelectronic applications based on compound semiconductors. These\ndevices are used in a variety of innovative applications and industries. These include laser,\nLED, display technologies, optical and wireless data transmission, SiC and GaN power\nelectronics, and many other leading-edge applications. The Company was founded in\n1983 and is headquartered in Herzogenrath, Germany (City Region of Aachen).\nFor further information on AIXTRON (FSE: AIXA, ISIN DE000A0WMPJ6) please visit our\nwebsite at: www.aixtron.com\nOur registered trademarks: AIXACT(R), AIXTRON(R), Close Coupled Shower- head(R), EXP(R), EPISON(R), Gas\nFoil Rotation(R), OptacapTM, OVPD(R), Planetary Reactor(R), PVPD(R), STExS(R), TriJet(R)\n5\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nLetter to Shareholders\nDear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAIXTRON continued to grow in its fiscal year 2022: despite a slowdown in some areas of\nthe semiconductor market and the strain on supply chains, we succeeded in raising order\nintake to EUR 585.9 million (+18%), revenues to EUR 463.2 million (+8%), and operating\nincome to EUR 104.7 million (+6%). These figures underline the continued success of our\nstrategy with its clear focus on the compound semiconductor equipment business.\nCompared to traditional silicon – the conventional base material of the semiconductor\nindustry – compound semiconductors offer superior physical properties in terms of\nelectrical performance, switching speed, and light generation. Step by step, our vision of\nemerging markets driven by the overarching themes of ecological sustainability,\nelectrification, and digitalization is becoming a reality. This is the foundation for our\ngrowth, and in 2022 we made significant progress in all core areas.\nFor example, our new G10-SiC deposition system for the innovative material silicon\ncarbide (SiC) already generated the highest order intake of all our products in its first\nquarter on the market. The G10-SiC enhances both performance and productivity for the\nestablished 150 mm SiC wafer size and also gives customers the option to process\nemerging 200 mm SiC wafers. As such, AIXTRON is making a significant contribution to the\nreduction of CO emissions and the transition to electromobility. SiC is fast becoming a\n2\nkey technology for electric vehicle power trains and charging infrastructure, as well as for\nthe efficient conversion of renewable energy. The market launch of the G10-SiC not only\nrepresents a first milestone in the revamping of our product portfolio, but also lays the\nfoundation for additional growth in SiC power electronics. Analysts forecast sustained\ngrowth for the SiC device market over the coming decades – the electrification of our\nworld is still in its infancy.\nWe also made significant progress in the field of gallium nitride (GaN) power electronics\nin 2022. Since its commercial breakthrough two years ago, this material system has been\nopening up an increasing number of new applications. Several customers continued their\nbuild-up of production facilities for the large-scale production of GaN power\nsemiconductors last year and numerous new customers chose GaN as their material\nsystem and ordered AIXTRON equipment. In addition to initial applications in consumer\nelectronics, there is particularly strong growth in industrial applications – such as power\nsupply for data centers and telecommunication facilities – as well as in photovoltaics.\nFurther applications are set to follow and will help make our vision of efficient, compact,\nand fast electricity conversion a reality, thus largely replacing the incumbent material\nsilicon.\nIn optoelectronics, we were able to meet consistently strong demand for systems to\nmanufacture lasers for optical data communication via glass fiber optic networks. The\nmegatrend digitalization continues to drive strong growth in data transmission volumes –\nbe it for video streaming, virtual meetings, or cloud and edge computing. We have also\nbeen working closely with customers on the development of micro LEDs for the next\ngeneration of displays. Micro LED displays are far superior to conventional LCD- or OLED-\nbased displays in terms of image quality: they consume up to 90% less energy and also\n6\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\noffer greatly superior luminosity and color gamut. This makes Micro LED displays\nparticularly attractive for mobile devices such as smartwatches, smartphones, and\naugmented reality glasses, but also for next-generation televisions. In this particular field,\nwe received our first volume production order for Micro LEDs supporting the target to\nlaunch the first commercial Micro LED product on the market. This is a first, highly\npromising step into a further new market segment.\nAll these developments demonstrate that compound semiconductors play an increasingly\nsignificant role in the semiconductor industry and are gradually opening up further\napplications. We expect this trend to generate further growth in the coming years. In\norder to cope with this growing demand, we worked hard to strengthen our internal\nstructures and processes across all areas of the company in 2022. In addition, our asset-\nlight business model gives us considerable flexibility to adapt to rising production\nvolumes. We receive valuable support in this regard from our business partners and\nsuppliers, with whom we regularly exchange information on expected business\ndevelopments. We also actively support them with their own development and\nsystematically qualify new partners to meet anticipated volume growth. In view of the\nprevailing shortage of materials in the manufacturing sector, these measures proved to\nbe highly effective in fiscal 2022: despite global supply chain bottlenecks, we were able to\nsatisfy all customer requirements and at the same time increase revenues.\nOur customer proximity and strong connection to the academic world allow us to identify\nindustrial and technological trends at a very early stage and to incorporate these insights\ninto our processes to develop products that best meet customer requirements in terms of\nperformance and cost. With our completely revamped product portfolio, we expect to\nachieve or maintain strong positions in all our markets – both now and in the future.\nFollowing the launch of the G10-SiC, we also recently introduced our G10-AsP platform on\nthe market. A further product platform will follow in the current year.\nOur Executive Board Members Dr. Jochen Linck, Dr. Felix Grawert and Dr. Christian Danninger (from left to right).\n7\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nAIXTRON also plays a pioneering role when it comes to ecological sustainability: we have\nbeen carbon neutral since 2019 and AIXTRON was one of the first companies to report EU\ntaxonomy aligned figures in 2021 – when it was still voluntary. We made further progress\nin this field in the fiscal year 2022: our taxonomy alignment for revenues is now 58%, for\nOpEx 73%, and for CapEx 38%. The driving force behind these figures are our markets, as\nenvironmentally sustainable applications in the field of SiC power electronics and micro\nLEDs in particular accounted for a higher share of revenues last year. Our sustainable\nbusiness model is also reflected in the positive and steadily improving ESG ratings we\nreceived, e.g. the upgrade of our MSCI rating from A to AA.\nThe key to our success are our employees. Their creativity and problem-solving skills,\ntheir experience and industry know-how, combined with an outstanding commitment to\nperformance, continue to be the foundation of AIXTRON. In 2022, we were able to recruit\nmore than 230 highly skilled colleagues who will help us successfully scale up for future\ngrowth. After all, we are extremely optimistic about the future. And this is reflected in our\nstrong, AIXTRON-specific corporate culture and the special spirit that permeates the\ncompany. We will continue to carefully nurture this culture with a great sense of\nresponsibility. Our special thanks go to all our colleagues for their dedication and hard\nwork!\nOur suppliers and business partners also played a decisive role in our success. Despite the\nconstraints on global supply chains, they successfully contributed to another very strong\nyear of growth for AIXTRON. We are also indebted to them. We would also like to express\nour sincere gratitude to the Supervisory Board for their trust and cooperation. Finally, we\nwould like to thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in us and in our ability to\nlead AIXTRON into a successful future of ecologically and economically sustainable\ngrowth.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE\nDr. Felix Grawert Dr. Christian Danninger Dr. Jochen Linck\nChairman Member Member\n8\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nSupervisory Board Report\nAIXTRON can again look back on a very successful fiscal year. Order intake increased by\n18% and Revenues by 8% compared to the previous year. This development is the result\nof a consistent implementation of the corporate strategy pursued by the Executive Board\nand supported by the Supervisory Board.\nThe addressed growth markets of compound semiconductors developed very positively\nand enabled AIXTRON to benefit from this development with its leading technologies. The\nnew successfully launched AIX G10-SiC system platform has already generated very strong\ncustomer interest in its initial phase. AIXTRON also has its supply chain under control and\nthe Company is making great progress in attracting new employees to strengthen the\nCompany's structures for further growth. Through targeted investments in research and\ndevelopment, AIXTRON is laying the foundations for future success, both in the short and\nlong term.\nIn addition to commercial success, the Company is also focusing on ESG (Environment,\nSocial and Governance) aspects. Further progress was made in this area and the very\ngood results in the EU taxonomy aligned key figures again impressively demonstrate the\ngood and sustainable path AIXTRON is on.\nThroughout the reporting year, the Supervisory Board performed the duties and\nresponsibilities entrusted to it by law, the Articles of Association, and the Rules of\nProcedure without limitation. The training and continuing education measures of the\nSupervisory Board members are appropriately supported by the Company.\nCooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored the Executive Board in its management of\nthe Company and advised it on all matters of importance to the Company, so that the\nSupervisory Board was always able to verify the legality and regularity, expediency, and\neconomic efficiency of the Company’s management.\nThe Supervisory Board was directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of\nfundamental importance to the Company. The Executive Board informed the Supervisory\nBoard regularly, promptly, and comprehensively about the course of business, corporate\nplanning, and the strategic development of the AIXTRON Group. In addition, the\nSupervisory Board regularly consulted with the Executive Board on the Company’s risk\nsituation, risk management, and compliance. Particular attention was paid to the areas of\ninformation security and ESG, about which the Executive Board also provided the\nSupervisory Board with comprehensive information. Based on the Executive Board’s\nreports, business developments and other events of importance to the Company were\ndiscussed in detail. The Supervisory Board approved the respective resolution proposals\nof the Executive Board after thorough examination and consultation.\n9\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe Supervisory Board did not make use of the opportunity to review the Company's\nbooks and records (Section 111 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)).\nCooperation with the Executive Board was characterized in every aspect by responsible\nand targeted action. The Executive Board fully complied with its reporting obligations to\nthe Supervisory Board, both verbally and in writing.\nThe Executive Board supports the members of the Supervisory Board to an appropriate\nextent in the training and continuing education measures they are generally responsible\nfor. In addition, the Company provides the members with up-to-date, topic-specific\ninformation material in order to keep them informed about current market trends in the\nsemiconductor industry and important capital market issues. In addition, AIXTRON\nsupports participation in further training events relevant to Supervisory Board activities.\nNew Supervisory Board members are introduced to all relevant topics and processes in an\nonboarding program, in particular with comprehensive background information on the\ntechnologies and markets in which AIXTRON operates (recommendation D.11 German\nCorporate Governance Code 2022).\nAs Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I was also in regular contact with the Executive\nBoard even beyond the Supervisory Board meetings. In addition to the current business\nsituation and important business transactions, we discussed especially matters of\nstrategic positioning of the Company.\nSupervisory Board Meetings 2022\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board held five ordinary meetings on February 23, May 24 and\n25, September 20, and December 12, and three extraordinary meetings on July 25,\nNovember 18, and December 11.

As in previous years, such\na determination was not necessary for the 2022 fiscal year.\nThe annual financial statements and the combined management report of AIXTRON SE\nand the AIXTRON Group as of December 31, 2022, were prepared in accordance with the\nrules of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements and\nthe group management report as of December 31, 2022, were prepared in accordance\nwith Section 315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards\nIFRS.

The financial statements including the combined management report\nwere issued with an unqualified audit opinion. The non-financial consolidated report\nreceived the note on an audit to obtain limited assurance. The auditors found that the\ncombined management report of the Company and the Group accurately presents the\ncurrent business and future development of the Company and the Group.\nThe financial statement documents (annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE and\nconsolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, as well as the combined\nmanagement report of AIXTRON SE and the Group), the proposal for the appropriation of\nprofits, the separate Group non-financial report as well as the auditor's reports were\nsubmitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.

The combined management report is\nconsistent with our own assessment of the situation and business development of the\nCompany and the Group. We concurred with the auditor's findings, with which we fully\nagreed in terms of content and approved the annual financial statements and the\nconsolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report prepared\nby the Executive Board, as well as the Group non-financial (sustainability) report of the\nCompany for fiscal year 2022, by resolution dated February 27, 2023.

In Deutsche Börse’s MDAX ranking, which includes a total of\n50 stocks, it was ranked 15th in terms of market capitalization as of December 31, 2022\n(2021: 42nd place). Among the 30 TecDAX members, the share marked an 8th place\n(2021: 17th place).\nIn addition to the traditional trading platforms such as XETRA and the German regional\nstock exchanges, trading in AIXTRON shares also takes place to a significant extent on\nalternative trading platforms such as Tradegate or Chi-X.\nAIXTRON Share Price Development during 2022\nAIXTRON Share: High Volatility and Significant Gains\nThe AIXTRON share benefited from the very successful business development of the\ngroup and was able to clearly set itself apart from the total market and the competition in\nthe overall challenging market environment from March onwards. Due to the high\nvaluation levels that had then been reached, technology stocks in particular reacted very\nsensitively to the news about the war in Ukraine, the associated sharp increase in\ninflation and interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank and the US Federal\nReserve. The AIXTRON share was not always able to escape this development.\nAfter a positive start to the stock market year 2022, the upward movement ended at the\nend of January and the subsequent downward movement was reinforced by interest rate\nmovements and the beginning of the Russian invasion into Ukraine. The publication of the\n16\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nannual results for 2021 and the positive prospects for 2022 were able to break the\ndownward trend in the following trading weeks. The share price rose significantly by the\nend of May. The announcement of further operational successes, the very good result for\nthe first quarter of 2022 and positive studies from renowned analyst firms such as\nJefferies or Exane supported this positive development.\nAfter profit-taking and a volatile month in June, the share traded around the barrier of\nEUR 21.18 in early July, only to reach its multi-year high of EUR 31.65 in early December.\nThe publication of the third quarter results led to a short-term consolidation of the share.\nHowever, the share was able to quickly break through this trend, as investors assumed\nstrong market growth for SiC, GaN and Micro LEDs. After the stock's excellent year-to-\ndate performance, some investors took profits towards the end of the year.\nDespite the slight sell-off at the end of the 2022 stock market year, the AIXTRON share\nclearly set itself apart with a plus of 51% at a XETRA closing price of EUR 26.97 on\nDecember 30 compared to the benchmark indices, which fell significantly in value during\nthis period. The market capitalization at the end of the year was EUR 3,057 million (year-\nend 2021: EUR 2,024 million). The benchmark indices MDAX and TecDAX fell by 28.5% to\n25,117 points and 25.2% to 2,921 points over the course of 2022.\nBroadly Diversified Shareholder Structure\nAs of December 31, 2022, around 18% of AIXTRON shares were held by private individuals\n(2021: 22%), mostly based in Germany. Around 82% of the outstanding AIXTRON shares\nwere held by institutional investors (2021: 77%). The majority of institutional investors\nare based in North America (38%), followed by Great Britain and Ireland (19%) and\nGermany (18%). The remaining investors come from other parts of Europe and the rest of\nthe world.

According to the definition of Deutsche Börse, 99% of the shares were in free float\nand around 1% of the AIXTRON shares were held by the company itself.\nAll voting rights notifications made in 2022 and thereafter in accordance with sections 33\net seq. of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) can be found on our website.\nInformation on reportable holdings that currently exceed or fall below a certain threshold\ncan be found in the appendix to this report.\n17\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nShareholder Structure Regional Split of Free\nFloat\n18% 19%\n24%\n1%\n1%\n18%\n38%\n81%\nContinental Europe (24%)\nGermany (18%)\nRetail Investors (18%) North America (38%)\nAIXTRON Treasury (1%) Rest of World (1%)\nInstitutional Investors (81%) UK & Ireland (19%)\nResearch-Coverage\nDuring the fiscal year of 2022, a total of eleven international banks and brokerage houses\n(2021: twelve) published stock research reports on AIXTRON and the development of the\nsemiconductor industry on a frequent basis.

In accordance with the\nresolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022, the Supervisory Board\nappointed KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Essen, as the new auditor. The\nAudit Committee monitors the necessary independence of the auditor and the additional\nservices provided by the auditor. Finally, it deals with the issuing of the audit mandate to\nthe auditor, the determination of auditing focal points, and the fee agreement. The\nChairwoman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Anna Weber, reports regularly to the\nSupervisory Board on the work of the Audit Committee.\nFor the purpose of evaluating, supporting and implementing projects with capital market\nrelevance, a Capital Market Committee was set up in 2014, consisting of three members,\nthe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and two other members of the Supervisory Board.\nThe Nomination Committee, which consisted of the Chairman Mr. Frits van Hout and\nthree other members of the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2022, makes selection proposals\nto the full Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to executive bodies and\ndiscusses issues relating to the replacement of members of the Supervisory Board. As of\nJanuary 1, 2023, Mr. Kim Schindelhauer took over as Chairman from Mr. van Hout. The\nNomination Committee has since consisted of three members in total.\nIn addition, a Remuneration Committee has been established, which consisted of the\nsame members as the Nomination Committee in 2022. This committee deals with the\napplication of the remuneration system in accordance with the requirements of the\nGerman Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) and the\nGCGC.

Among\nother things, they contain a list of matters of fundamental or significant importance on\nwhich the Executive Board must formally resolve. This concerns, for example, decisions\non the Company’s strategies, business plans and budgets; material changes to the\nCompany and Group organization; the commencement or cessation of areas of activity of\nthe Company; the acquisition and sale of land or land rights; the conclusion, amendment\nand termination of corporate or significant license agreements; the award of major\nexternal consulting and research contracts; fundamental issues relating to human\nresources and personnel policy; determining the principles for representation in business\norganizations and associations; appointments to the management and supervisory bodies\nof subsidiaries and associated companies; important publications and information for the\npublic outside of mandatory disclosure duties; initiating lawsuits and legal disputes;\nproviding collateral and assuming guarantees.\n26\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Rules of Procedure for the Executive Board and the Articles of Association each\ncontain a catalog of significant transactions and measures that additionally require the\nprior approval of the Supervisory Board. The transactions and measures requiring\napproval under the Articles of Association or the Rules of Procedure include, for example,\ndecisions on the establishment or sale of business premises, the acquisition or sale of\nland, the commencement or cessation of areas of activity, or the granting or taking out of\nloans.\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure, meetings of the Executive Board are held at\nleast twice a month and whenever required for the good of the Company. Meetings of\nthe Executive Board are convened and chaired by the Chairman of the Executive Board.\nEach member of the Executive Board can arrange an additional meeting on a specific\ntopic at any time. If the Chairman of the Executive Board is unable to attend, the meeting\nis chaired by the member of the Executive Board designated for this purpose by the\nChairman of the Executive Board, or by the oldest member of the Executive Board. The\nExecutive Board constitutes a quorum if all members have been invited and more than\nhalf of its members are present at the time a resolution is adopted, whereby members of\nthe Executive Board connected by telephone or video conference are deemed to be\npresent. Unless otherwise stipulated by law, the Articles of Association or the Rules of\nProcedure, the Executive Board adopts resolutions by a simple majority of the votes cast.\nIn the event of a tie, the Chairman of the Executive Board has the casting vote.\nEach member of the Executive Board must disclose any conflicts of interest to the\nSupervisory Board without delay and inform the other members of the Executive Board\naccordingly. Members of the Executive Board may only take on secondary activities, in\nparticular supervisory board mandates outside the Company, with the approval of the\nSupervisory Board.\nLong-term Succession Planning for the Executive Board and Age Limit for the\nExecutive Board\nAIXTRON is a globally operating company in a highly dynamic and technologically\ndemanding market environment. It is therefore of strategic importance for AIXTRON to\nhave a competent Executive Board and to appoint suitable candidates to the Executive\nBoard. Following the generational change on the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board\nis also pursuing long-term succession planning. The Nomination Committee bases its work\non the requirements and competency profile that has been developed and described,\nwhich is continuously reviewed and refined. As part of succession planning, the\nSupervisory Board and the Executive Board will also discuss suitable internal candidates\nfor the Executive Board. The age limit for the Executive Board is 65 and is set out in the\nExecutive Board’s Rules of Procedure.\nSupervisory Board and its Composition\nPursuant to Article 11 of AIXTRON SE’s Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board\nconsists of six members. According to the Articles of Association, the members of the\nSupervisory Board are appointed until the end of the Annual General Meeting which\nresolves on the approval of the Supervisory Board’s activities for the fourth fiscal year\nafter the term of office begins, whereby the fiscal year in which the appointment was\n27\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nmade is not included. The Annual General Meeting may provide for a shorter term of\noffice.\nThe Supervisory Board elects a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman from among its\nmembers. The Supervisory Board Chairman convenes and conducts the Supervisory Board\nmeetings. If he is unable to do so, his Deputy takes over this function.\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted Rules of Procedure. They govern the tasks, rights and\nobligations of the Supervisory Board, the organization of meetings and resolutions, and\nthe formation of committees. The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board were last\nrevised in December 2022. The Audit Committee has separate Rules of Procedure\nestablished by the Supervisory Board.\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board is generally available for discussions with\ninvestors but only to the extent that such discussions take place within a reasonable\nframework and the topics fall within the sole competence of the Supervisory Board. No\ndiscussions with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board were requested in the past fiscal\nyear. Accordingly, no such discussions took place.\n28\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs of December 31, 2022, the composition of the Supervisory Board in accordance with\nthe Articles of Association and as determined by the Annual General Meeting was as\nfollows:\nComposition of the Supervisory Board\n(as of December 31, 2022)\nName Position Member since End of term\nChairman of the Supervisory\nBoard, Chairman of the Capital\nKim Schindelhauer1)2)3)4)5) Market Committee 2002 HV 2023\nDeputy Chairman of the\nSupervisory Board, Chairman of\nthe Remuneration and\nFrits van Hout 3)4) Nomination Committee 2019 HV 2024\nProf. Dr. Andreas Biagosch2) 2013 HV 2024\nProf. Dr. Petra Denk3)4) 2011 HV 2024\nDr. Stefan Traeger1)2)3)4) 2022 HV 2025\nChairwoman of the Audit\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber 1) Committee 2019 HV 2024\n1) Member of the Audit Committee\n2) Member of the Capital Market Committee\n3) Member of the Nomination Committee\n4) Member of the Remuneration Committee\n5) Former AIXTRON Executive Board member\nComposition of Committees\n(as of December 31, 2022)\nAudit Capital Market Nomination Remuneration\nCommittee Committee Committee Committee\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber Kim Schindelhauer Frits van Hout Frits van Hout\n(Chairwoman) (Chairman) (Chairman) (Chairman)\nProf. Dr. Andreas\nKim Schindelhauer Biagosch Prof. Dr. Petra Denk Prof. Dr. Petra Denk\nDr. Stefan Traeger Dr. Stefan Traeger Kim Schindelhauer Kim Schindelhauer\nDr. Stefan Traeger Dr. Stefan Traeger\n29\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIndependence of Supervisory Board Members and Cooperation between the\nSupervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board shall comprise what it considers to be a sufficient number of\nindependent members (recommendation C.6 GCGC 2022). Accordingly, the Supervisory\nBoard has set itself the goal that more than half of its members shall be independent\n(recommendation C.7 GCGC 2022). The Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall be\nindependent of the Company and the Executive Board (recommendation C.10 GCGC\n2022). AIXTRON considers Mr. Schindelhauer to be independent despite the period of\ntime he has been a member of the Supervisory Board. During his time as Chairman of the\nSupervisory Board, Mr. Schindelhauer has always maintained a professional distance from\nthe Company and the Executive Board and has fulfilled his monitoring and advisory duties\nby applying an appropriate critical attitude at all times (recommendation C.8 GCGC 2022).\nAs all members of the Supervisory Board, which consists exclusively of elected\nshareholder representatives, are therefore to be regarded as independent, this\nrecommendation is also met.\nThe Supervisory Board includes Mr. Schindelhauer, a former member of the Executive\nBoard, whose term of office as a member of the Executive Board, however, was more\nthan two years ago (see also C.7 GCGC 2022). The Supervisory Board therefore complies\nwith recommendation C.11 of the GCGC 2022 that it shall not include more than two\nformer members of the Executive Board.\nThe Supervisory Board must include at least one member with expertise in the field of\nauditing and at least one other member with expertise in the field of accounting. These\nrequirements are met by the two members, Prof. Dr. Weber and Mr. Schindelhauer.\nAhead of the Supervisory Board meeting in December 2022, the members of the\nSupervisory Board received the self-evaluation questionnaire, which was\ncomprehensively revised by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. After evaluation of\nthe questionnaire, the Supervisory Board determined that the Supervisory Board\nperforms its activities effectively in accordance with recommendation D.12 of the GCGC\n2022.\nFurther mandates of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are\nlisted in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in section 36 “Supervisory\nBoard and Executive Board”.\nThe Company did not enter into or carry out any material transactions with any related\nparties in the fiscal year 2022.\nThe Audit Committee is chaired by Prof. Dr. Weber, an independent and expert member\nof the Supervisory Board in accordance with recommendation D.3 GCGC 2022. She is not\nthe same person as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In the persons of Prof. Dr.\nWeber and Mr. Schindelhauer, the Audit Committee includes one member with expertise\nin the field of auditing and one further member with expertise in the field of accounting.\nLike the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board holds four regular meetings per\ncalendar year. Extraordinary Supervisory Board meetings as well as meetings of the Audit,\nNomination, Remuneration, and Capital Market Committees are convened as required.\n30\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAt the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, or the Chairpersons of the\nCommittees, the Executive Board regularly attends the ordinary meetings (generally four\ntimes a year) of the Supervisory Board or individual committee meetings, reports in\nwriting and orally on the individual agenda items and draft resolutions, and answers the\nquestions of individual Supervisory Board members. Between meetings, all members of\nthe Supervisory Board receive detailed quarterly reports from the Executive Board on the\nsituation of the Company. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the\nChairwoman of the Audit Committee are informed by the Executive Board about\nimportant developments and upcoming important decisions in telephone calls and\npersonal discussions. In accordance with recommendation D.6 GCGC 2022, meetings are\nalso held without participation of the Executive Board.\nAs a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board and its committees are passed at the\nmeetings. In justified exceptional cases, Supervisory Board members may also participate\nin a meeting of the Supervisory Board or a committee by telephone or video conference.\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees each constitute a quorum if two thirds of the\nmembers participate in the adoption of the resolution (outside of meetings by means of a\nvote conducted in writing, by fax, by telephone or by e-mail, or by a combination of the\naforementioned communication media, provided that no member of the Supervisory\nBoard objects to this procedure). Resolutions require a simple majority of the votes cast.\nIn the event of a tie, the chairman of the meeting has the casting vote.\nEach member of the Supervisory Board shall disclose to the Supervisory Board any\nconflicts of interest, in particular those that may arise as a result of a consultancy or\ndirectorship function with customers, suppliers, lenders or other third parties. Any\nconflicts of interest on the part of a member of the Supervisory Board that are material\nand not merely temporary shall result in that person having to resign from office.\nSelf-evaluation of the Supervisory Board\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-evaluation based on\na questionnaire, taking into account AIXTRON-specific criteria. The results were discussed\nby the Supervisory Board and confirmed that cooperation both within the Supervisory\nBoard and with the Executive Board was characterized by a high degree of trust and\nopenness and was always professional and constructive. The Supervisory Board and its\ncommittees were also considered to be adequately informed and effective in their work.\nHence there is no fundamental need for change.\n31\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation on the Equal Representation of Men and Women as per\nSection 76 para. 4 and Section 111 para. 5 AktG\nPursuant to Sections 76 para. 4, 111 para. 5 AktG, the supervisory boards and executive\nboards of companies listed on the stock exchange or subject to co-determination must\nset target figures for the proportion of women on their supervisory boards, executive\nboards and the two management levels below the executive board. The GCGC 2022\nreflects these regulations in principle 3 and principle 9 sentence 2 for the executive board\nand in recommendation C.1 sentence 2 for the supervisory board.\nAIXTRON aims to increase both the proportion of women and the internationality of its\nemployees and managers. In doing so, the Company is primarily committed to the\nprofessional and social skills of all employees.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has set the following target figures for the\nproportion of women to be reached by December 31, 2025:\nTarget as of Women’s quota\nLevel 31.12.2025 as of 31.12.2022 Determined by\nSupervisory Board 33% 33% Supervisory Board\nExecutive Board 0% 0% Supervisory Board\nSince initially setting the target figures, the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE was first\nreduced from six to five members. On May 25, 2022, the Annual General Meeting elected\nDr. Stefan Traeger as a new member of the Supervisory Board. As a result, the\nSupervisory Board consists of six members again. It continues to include two women,\nbringing the proportion of female Supervisory Board members to around 33% as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The current composition of the Executive Board is in line with the\ntarget set for the Executive Board.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE has set itself the objective of specifically promoting\nwomen in the Company. In line with this objective, the Executive Board has now raised\nthe targets for the proportion of women to 10% for the first level below the Executive\nBoard and to 20% for the second level below the Executive Board. These targets are to be\nachieved by December 31, 2025.\nTarget as of Women’s quota\nLevel 31.12.2025 as of 31.12.2022 Determined by\n1. tier management 10% 4% Executive Board\n2. tier management 20% 26% Executive Board\nBased on the current composition of the Executive Board, no changes in the composition\nare initially planned until the end of 2025, so that the target for the proportion of women\non the Executive Board valid until December 31, 2025 has been set at 0%. The proportion\nof women at all management levels will be prioritized as part of long-term succession\nplanning. To this end, the Executive Board has rolled out various personnel development\ninitiatives that promote the advancement of young female talent at AIXTRON. These\ninclude, for example, coaching and mentoring programs for selected female managers. In\naddition, there were regular women’s network meetings in 2022, which enabled\nparticipants to share their views on strategic corporate management topics. In order to\nensure equal participation of women in management positions, the Supervisory Board\n32\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nand Executive Board of AIXTRON SE are focusing even more on women when evaluating\njob candidates.\nDiversity Concept for Executive Board and Supervisory Board;\nObjectives for the Composition of the Supervisory Board and Ctatus\nof Implementation\nExecutive Board\nAs required by the GCGC 2022, AIXTRON has addressed the issue of objectives with\nregard to an appropriate level of diversity in the Company’s management\n(recommendations B.1 and C.1).\nWhen proposing the appointment of new members to the Executive Board by the\nNomination Committee, the Supervisory Board takes into account their personal and\nprofessional suitability, international experience and leadership qualities, the age limit set\nfor members of the Executive Board, and diversity – also with regard to aspects such as\nage, gender, and educational and professional background. The Executive Board shall\nconsist of members with different, complementary skill profiles as well as a sufficient age\nmix and possess different personalities.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned qualities, members of the Executive Board should, as\nfar as possible, have different knowledge and experience as well as educational and\nprofessional backgrounds, both individually and in their entirety as a team. In view of the\nCompany's international orientation, experience abroad is an advantage. In its search for\nsuitable candidates to fill vacant positions on the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board\ntook account of the diversity concept and, as part of this, also considered female\ncandidates.\nSupervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board has set the target for the proportion of women on the Supervisory\nBoard at 33% by December 31, 2025. With Prof. Dr. Petra Denk and Prof. Dr. Anna Weber,\ntwo of the six members of the Supervisory Board are currently women, corresponding to\na proportion of around 33%.\nThe targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board are shown in detail below:\n• When proposing candidates for election to the Supervisory Board, the Nomination\nCommittee ensures that the Supervisory Board always includes members who,\nindividually and collectively as a team, have the knowledge, skills and professional\nexperience required to properly perform their duties. Furthermore, the members\nshould be independent. In this way, the Nomination Committee contributes to\nincreasing the efficiency and transparency of the selection process. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Board members should be elected for the longest period of time\npermitted by the statutes.\n33\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n• AIXTRON is strongly export-oriented. Experience in AIXTRON’s specific electronics\nand semiconductor markets is therefore a great advantage.\n• As a general rule, an age limit of 70 should be appropriate for Supervisory Board\nmembers upon retirement. New Supervisory Board members should be available to\nthe Company for at least two election periods.\n• It is desirable that the individual members of the Supervisory Board have the most\ndiverse education, qualifications, expertise and international experience possible in\norder to have the knowledge, skills and professional experience necessary to\nproperly perform their duties. Company- and product-oriented coverage with an\nunderstanding of the business model, the industry-specific features and the\nprocesses in the various areas of business administration, accounting, auditing,\ncorporate development, capital markets, technology, special equipment\nmanufacturing, markets/sales, semiconductor market etc. are advantageous.\n• It is in the best interests of the Company to utilize the potential of well-trained and\nmotivated employees of different nationalities and genders. The Supervisory Board\nconsiders appropriate participation of women on the Supervisory Board to be very\nimportant. This is reflected in the current proportion of women on the Supervisory\nBoard of around 33%.\n• In its opinion, the Supervisory Board should have a sufficient number of independent\nmembers, whereby a member of the Supervisory Board shall not be considered\nindependent in particular if he or she has a business or personal relationship with\nthe Company, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or a company affiliated\nwith the latter that could give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of\ninterest.\n• More than half of the Supervisory Board shall consist of independent members.\n• No more than two former members of the Executive Board shall be members of the\nSupervisory Board.\n• The members of the Supervisory Board shall not exercise any executive or advisory\nfunctions at major competitors of the Company.\n• At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of\naccounting and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have\nexpertise in the field of auditing. These two members shall then also be members of\nthe Audit Committee.\n• Due to the increased demands on the professionalization of the Supervisory Board’s\nmembers and in order to simultaneously ensure the greatest possible efficiency of\nthe Supervisory Board’s activities as in previous years, new Supervisory Board\nmembers shall not hold more than five mandates in other listed companies or other\ncompanies if they have comparable requirements, whereby a supervisory board\nchairmanship counts double.\nIn addition to the objectives set for its composition, the Supervisory Board has also drawn\nup a skills profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole. In view of AIXTRON’s business\nactivities and the markets addressed by the Company, the Supervisory Board shall have\nexpertise in the areas of technology, finance/accounting, capital markets, strategy and\n34\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\ncorporate governance, and in ecological sustainability topics of relevance to AIXTRON SE.\nFurthermore, a grown network of contacts and many years of experience in the\nrespective disciplines are advantageous.\nThe requirement for diversity within the Supervisory Board (recommendation C.1\nsentence 2 GCGC 2022) is taken into account, among other things, as a result of the\ndiverse skills of the individual Supervisory Board members (with regard to areas such as\nfinance, capital markets, M&A, and technology and markets).\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE are convinced that the\ncomposition of the Supervisory Board fully complies with its own objectives and skills\nprofile as well as with the requirement of the current GCGC for appropriate diversity and\nan appropriate number of independent Supervisory Board members.\n35\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIn the following qualification matrix (recommendation C.1 GCGC 2022), the Supervisory\nBoard presents a clear overview of the implementation status of the desired skills profile\nfor the Supervisory Board as a whole:\nProf. Dr.\nKim Frits van Prof. Dr. Dr. Stefan Prof. Dr.\nAndreas\nSchindelhauer Hout Petra Denk Traeger Anna Weber\nBiagosch\nMembership\nduration\nMember since 2002 2019 2013 2011 2022 2019\nGeneral suitability\nIndependence 1) + + + + + +\nNo overboarding + + + + + +\nDiversity\nYear of birth 1953 1960 1955 1972 1967 1984\nGender m m m w m w\nNationality German Dutch German German German German\nInternational\n+ + + + +\nexperience\nMechanical Physics and Physics and\nBusiness Engineering Business Business Business\nEducational\nAdmini- Physics and Business Admini- Admini- Admini-\nbackground\nstration Admini- stration stration stration\nstration (EBW) (MBA)\nProfessional\nknowledge 2)\nCompany\nmanagement 3) + + + +\nStrategy + + + + +\nSales & marketing + + +\nOperations + + + +\nDigitalization + + +\nPersonnel / HR + + + + + +\nCapital market / IR + + +\nAccounting and\n+ +\nAuditing\nLegal / Compliance /\nCorporate + + + +\nGovernance\nSustainability / ESG + + + +\nKnowledge of\ntechnologies &\nmarkets\nSemiconductor\n(equipment) + + + + +\nindustry\nCompound\n+ + + +\nsemiconductors\n1) In accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code\n2) Criterion met (+), based on self-assessment by Supervisory Board member\n3) Experience as Executive Board member of capital market-oriented companies of similar complexity or comparable\nexperience\n36\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDue to her many years of experience as an auditor, as well as a member of the\nSupervisory Board of another listed company – also serving as the Chairwoman of its\nAudit Committee – and her professorship for general business administration focusing on\nexternal accounting, the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee of AIXTRON SE, Prof. Dr.\nAnna Weber, is deemed to have expertise in the field of accounting and auditing.\nMoreover, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Mr. Kim Schindelhauer (member of\nthe Audit Committee), is deemed to have expertise in the field of accounting.

Within the scope of\nwhat is legally permissible, the Supervisory Board targets to offer the members of the\nExecutive Board a remuneration scheme that is customary in the market and at the same\ntime competitive in order to be able to attract outstanding personalities to AIXTRON SE\nand retain them in the long term.\nOn the basis of the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board sets a target for the total\nremuneration for each Executive Board member for the upcoming fiscal year, which\nconsists of three components:\n• fixed remuneration,\n• short-term performance-related variable remuneration (short-term incentive, STI),\nand\n• long-term performance-related variable remuneration (long-term incentive, LTI).\n39\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration Structure\nFixed remuneration consists of fixed, non-performance-related base remuneration,\nwhich is paid out as a monthly salary. Other components of fixed remuneration include\nfringe benefits, such as a company car, allowances for individual private pensions, and the\nassumption of costs for other insurance policies.\nThe variable remuneration is directly linked to the strategy and the performance of the\nAIXTRON Group and consists of the short-term STI and the long-term LTI. The amount of\nthe two variable remuneration elements depends on the achievement of financial and\nnon-financial performance criteria. In the interests of the shareholders, the company\ndoes not publish the details of individual market-related KPIs that could allow\ncompetitors to draw conclusions about the strategic intentions of the company. The\nweighting and KPI value of each target are determined before the beginning of each fiscal\nyear by the Supervisory Board and the result is solely determined by the actual KPI\nachievement without any discretionary adjustments.\nShort-term Performance-Related Variable Remuneration\nThe short-term, performance-related remuneration Short Term Incentive (STI) is based\non the performance achieved by the AIXTRON Group in the fiscal year and is granted\nentirely in cash.\nThe STI is measured based on the key indicators of consolidated net income, the market\nposition of the AIXTRON Group and financial and operational targets. The relative\nweighting is 70% for the consolidated net income, 15% for the market position and 15%\nfor financial and operational goals.\n40\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nShort-term Variable Remuneration (STI)\nThe targets are set prior to the start of a fiscal year: The Supervisory Board establishes\nthe STI‘s target value and the targets based on the aforementioned indicators. In the\nevent of 100% target achievement, the individual target STI of the Executive Board\nmembers varies from 1.1% to 1.75% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant\nto the budget approved by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year.\nSTI target achievement is determined after the expiry of the fiscal year. This is capped at\na maximum of 250% target achievement. No STI is paid if the consolidated net income for\nthe year is negative, i.e. in years in which the Company posts a loss. STI is paid out in cash\nafter the Supervisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term Performance-Related Variable Remuneration (LTI)\nThe amount of long-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the\nlong- term incentive (LTI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group over a 3-\nyear reference period and is granted entirely in AIXTRON shares. Executive Board\nmembers may first dispose of these shares following a four-year holding period calculated\nfrom the start of the reference period.\nBefore the start of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets\nfor each Executive Board member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive\nBoard member receives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI, which\nvaries from 1.4% to 2.25% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the\nbudget adopted by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year. The number of forfeitable\nstock awards is calculated based on the average of the closing prices on all stock market\ntrading days in the final quarter of the previous year. If consolidated net income for the\nyear is budgeted to be zero or negative, and if a return to profitability is expected during\nthe reference period, the Supervisory Board may within reasonable limits specify a LTI\nvalue for the fiscal year.\n41\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for\nthe year and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. In this regard,\nthe relative weighting amounts to 50% for consolidated net income for the year, 40% for\nTSR, and 10% for sustainability targets.\nFor the first LTI key figure, the consolidated net income for the year, before the start of\neach fiscal year the Supervisory Board sets a target value on the aggregate consolidated\nnet incomes that are to be achieved during the reference period. After the reference\nperiod ends, the ratio of the actual value to the target value is calculated. If the two\nvalues are identical, target achievement amounts to 100%. Target achievement is capped\nat a maximum of 250%. If the ratio is zero or negative, target achievement amounts to\n0%. A linear interpolation takes place between the values of 0% and 250%.\nThe second LTI key figure, the TSR, denotes the total shareholder return over the\nreference period and is calculated as the ratio of the change in the stock price, plus paid\ndividends, at the end of the reference period to the value at the start of the reference\nperiod. The TSR for AIXTRON stock is determined by the weighted TSR for a comparative\ngroup, which consists of the shares of six semiconductor equipment manufacturers –\nVeeco Instruments, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, ASML, and ASMI –\nand is weighted in proportion to their market capitalization. Changes in the share prices\nare determined by reference to the difference between the average values of the closing\nprices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter before the start of the\nreference period and in the final quarter of the reference period. After the reference\nperiod ends, the ratio of the development in the TSR for AIXTRON shares to the\ndevelopment in the TSR for the comparative group is calculated. Target achievement is\ncapped at a maximum of 250% and amounts to 0% if the ratio is less than 50%. A linear\ninterpolation takes place between these values. If during the period under consideration\nthe enterprises in the comparative group experience extraordinary changes (such as\nmergers, changes in business activities, etc.), the Supervisory Board may take this\nappropriately into consideration with regard to the composition of the comparative\ngroup. In such case, the Supervisory Board will report on this in the annual remuneration\nreport.\nThe third LTI key figure is calculated by reference to sustainability targets set by the\nSupervisory Board at the start of each reference period. These targets refer to the areas\n42\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nof environment, social affairs, and corporate governance. Target achievement\ncorresponds to the ratio of the actual values to the target values and is capped at 250%.\nBefore the start of each fiscal year, the Supervisory Board sets two to three sustainability\ntargets that are to be achieved by the end of the reference period. The sustainability\ntargets that the Supervisory Board may choose from before the start of a fiscal year when\nsetting targets for the respective Executive Board member include, among others:\nefficient use of energy and raw materials, reduction of emissions, employee satisfaction\nand development, customer satisfaction, innovation performance, successor planning,\nand compliance.\nAfter the expiry of the three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement\nis determined by the Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement,\nthe forfeitable stock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise\nlapse. The maximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection\nwith LTI is capped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start\nof the reference period.\nFollowing expiry of the four-year restriction period, the shares are transferred to the\nExecutive Board member, with due compliance with the maximum remuneration limits\nset out below. The Executive Board member is not entitled to receive dividends during\nthe restriction period.\nRemuneration limits\nThe remuneration system is intended to provide appropriate rewards for successful\nExecutive Board work and to ensure that the Executive Board and shareholders all benefit\nfrom the Company‘s positive development. At the same time, to prevent the taking of\ninappropriate risks and ensure an appropriate relation to the situation of the AIXTRON\nGroup, Executive Board remuneration is limited by setting a maximum remuneration and\na remuneration cap.\nMaximum remuneration (expenditure cap) is the total remuneration owed to the\nExecutive Board for a fiscal year. It may not exceed EUR 6.5 million in the case of two\nExecutive Board members or EUR 10.0 million in the case of three or more Executive\nBoard members. This also represents the expenditure cap, i.e. the maximum expense for\nthe Company.\nThere is also a remuneration cap (allocation cap) for the aggregate of fixed\nremuneration, STI, and LTI. The actual allocation for each Executive Board member for a\nfiscal year is capped at four times the Executive Board member’s target total\nremuneration. This is the allocation cap. If the remuneration cap is exceeded, a portion of\nthe vested stock awards previously awarded is forfeited to ensure compliance.\nFixed remuneration will generally account for 20% to 40% of target total remuneration,\nwhile variable remuneration will make up 60% to 80%. Long-term remuneration will ac-\ncount for a greater share of remuneration in order to provide incentives for long-term\nand sustainable actions. No additional remuneration is paid for group-internal mandates\nat subsidiaries.\n43\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFurther Provisions\nTo ensure that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of\nshareholders, the Company has a stock ownership policy. Following a four-year build-up\nphase, each Executive Board member is obliged to hold AIXTRON stock worth 100% of\ntheir base remuneration on a permanent basis throughout their term of office. The value\nof vested stock awards is set off against the respective target shareholding value.\nExecutive Board members may sell shares only if they exceed the respective target value.\nFurthermore, a sanctioning mechanism, i. e. claw-back policy, applies for breaches of\nduty or compliance. Based on this mechanism, in the event of such breaches the\nSupervisory Board may reduce variable remuneration components not yet paid out, allow\nstock awards to lapse, or even claw these back. These possibilities may be exercised even\nwhen the Executive Board member is no longer in office and is no longer employed by the\nCompany.\nIn justified exceptional circumstances, such as severe economic crises, the effects of\nwhich render the original Company targets invalid, the Supervisory Board may resolve a\ntemporary divergence from the remuneration system if such divergence is in the interests\nof AIXTRON SE. As a general rule, the targets and target values do not change during the\nperiods relevant for the respective target achievement, even if developments in the\noverall market are unfavorable.\nComparison of Remuneration\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the appropriateness of the various components of\nremuneration on an annual basis. The remuneration system is presented to the Annual\nGeneral Meeting for approval in the event of any material changes to the system and at\nleast every four years.\nFor the purposes of external comparison, the Supervisory Board refers to remuneration\ndata at the semiconductor equipment manufacturers Veeco Instruments, Applied\nMaterials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, ASML, and ASMI, as well as to those companies\nlisted in the TecDAX that have a market capitalization between 50% and 200% of that of\nAIXTRON SE.\nFor the internal comparison, the Supervisory Board defines the senior management level\nas the ten non-tariff remunerated senior managers who have the greatest managerial\nresponsibility and decision-making powers.\nArrangements upon Contract Termination\nShould a contract with an Executive Board member be terminated, then the outstanding\nvariable remuneration components attributable to the time through to termination of the\ncontract will be paid out in accordance with the originally agreed targets and comparison\nparameters and with the due dates or holding periods specified in the contract. If an Exe-\ncutive Board contract ends during a fiscal year, STI and LTI are granted on a prorated basis\nrelative to the length of service in this fiscal year.\n44\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe foregoing does not apply to cases in which the employment contract is terminated\nwithout notice for cause inherent in the Executive Board member for which he or she is\nresponsible. In such case, variable remuneration will not be paid for the year in which\ntermination becomes effective.\nIn the case of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate by reason of\nrevocation of the appointment, the Executive Board member will be paid a severance\nequal to the remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the remaining term\nof the employment contract, but not more than two years of remuneration (severance\ncap).\nWhen agreeing employment contracts with Executive Board members, the Supervisory\nBoard may stipulate that, in the event of the contract being terminated due to a “change-\nof-control” event, severance will be paid in the aforementioned maximum amount. A\nchange-of-control event in the foregoing sense exists where a third party, or a group of\nthird parties who combine their shareholding by contract in order to act as a single third\nparty, directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the Company’s share capital.\nBenefits in excess of this severance payment are not permitted.\nIn the event of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate based on mutual\nagreement to end the employment contract, the total value of benefits pledged by the\nCompany to the Executive Board member in connection with such agreement may not\nexceed the amount of remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the\noriginal remaining term of the employment contract and may not exceed a maximum of\ntwo annual remuneration packages.\n45\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Executive Board Members in Fiscal Year 2022\nIn fiscal year 2022, the remuneration system described above was applied for the\nmembers of the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE. The following section specifies the\nspecific Executive Board remuneration for the reporting year and contains detailed\ninformation and background on the total Executive Board remuneration, the target\nsetting and target achievement of the variable remuneration as well as individualized\ninformation on the remuneration of the individual Executive Board members.\nTotal Remuneration\nThe total remuneration of the Executive Board for the fiscal year 2022 amounted to EUR\n9,984 thousand (2021: EUR 8,437 thousand). The non-performance-related fixed\nremuneration of the Executive Board for the fiscal year 2022, consisting of a basic\nremuneration, pension allowances and benefits in kind, totaled EUR 1,113 thousand\n(2021: EUR 1,106 thousand).\nBase Remuneration\nBase remuneration comprised the following amounts in fiscal year 2022:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 400 thousand\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 300 thousand\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 300 thousand\nPension Allowances\nThe Executive Board members in office in the year under report do not have individual\npension commitments, as a result of which no provisions are stated for pensions. The\nCompany rather pays pension allowances to Executive Board members together with\ntheir salaries or makes contributions to an insurance contract with a pension fund.\nPension allowances form a constituent component of the non-performance-related fixed\nremuneration of the Executive Board. They comprised the following amounts in fiscal\nyear 2022:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 30 thousand\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 30 thousand\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 30 thousand\n46\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nShort-term Variable Remuneration (STI)\nTarget Dimension “Consolidated Net Income for the Year”\nIn its meeting on December 15, 2021, the Supervisory Board set a target value of EUR\n87,500 thousand for the consolidated net income for 2022 (70% of total target). The\nactually achieved value of EUR 100,472 thousand results in a target achievement of 115%\n(2021: 211%).\nTarget Dimension “Market Position”\nFor the target dimension \"market position\" (15% of total target), the Supervisory Board\nhas set targets for individual market segments. These targets for the 2022 fiscal year are\nweighted 50% for existing markets and 50% for new growth markets. A very good sales\nperformance in both the existing and the growth markets led to a target achievement of\n175% (2021: 183%) for the existing and 234% (2021: 228%) for the new markets.\nTarget Dimension “Financial and Operational Targets”\nFor the target dimension \"financial and operational targets\" (15% of total target),\nperformance criteria in the area of operational improvements and product-related\nimprovements were defined. Here, the target achievement in the past fiscal year was\n142% and 50% (2021: 143% for operational improvements, 129% for the market launch of\na new product and 65% for the realignment of OLED activities).\nBased on the achievement of these three target dimensions, short-term variable remune-\nration (STI) is calculated for fiscal year 2022 as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 1,963 thousand in cash\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 1,234 thousand in cash\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 1,234 thousand in cash.\nLong-Term Variable Remuneration (LTI)\nThe target achievement of the LTI tranche 2022 is calculated based on the results\nachieved in the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The following\nperformance criteria apply to them:\n• Consolidated net income for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 (50% of total)\n• Change in total shareholder return (TSR) from Q4/2021 to Q4/2024 (40% of total)\n• Sustainability (10% of total):\n◦ Percentage of aligned sales, operating expenses (OpEx) and investments\n(CapEx) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2024\n◦ Strategic leadership team and personnel development, measured against\ndefined target quotas for the year 2024\n47\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe relevant AIXTRON SE share price for the LTI target remuneration for fiscal year 2022\nis EUR 19,644. It corresponds to the average of the XETRA closing prices on all stock\nexchange trading days in Q4/2021. The degree of achievement of the performance\ncriteria will be determined by the Supervisory Board after the end of fiscal year 2024. At\nthat time, the vested share awards will be converted into non-forfeitable share awards\ndepending on target achievement. After the expiry of a 4-year vesting period ending on\nDecember 31, 2024, for the fiscal year 2022, one share of the Company will be\ntransferred for each vested share award. This is to take place in the week following the\npublication of the annual report.\nFor the long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for 2022, the Supervisory Board stipulated\nthe values of target LTI as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 1,969 thousand in forfeitable stock awards\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: EUR 1,225 thousand in forfeitable stock awards\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 1,225 thousand in forfeitable stock awards\n48\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTabular Overview of Performance Criteria Applied to Executive Board Remuneration\npursuant to Sec. 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 1 Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\nInformation on the performance targets\nDescription of\nCompo- a) Minimum a) Target a) Measured\nperformance Portion\nnent target achievement performance\nmeasures\nb) Corresponding b) Corresponding b) Corresponding\nremuneration remuneration remuneration\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 115\nConsolidated net\n70%\nincome 2022\nkEUR b) 0 b) 2,419 b) 2,778\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 204\nMarket position 15%\nkEUR. b) 0 b) 518 b) 1,060\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 175\nExisting markets 50%\nkEUR b) 0 b) 259 b) 454\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 234\nSTI\nNew markets 50%\n2022\nkEUR b) 0 b) 259 b) 606\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 114\nFinancial and\n15%\noperational targets\nkEUR b) 0 b) 518 b) 592\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 142\nOperational\n70%\nimprovements\nkEUR b) 0 b) 363 b) 514\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) 50\nProduct related\n30%\nimprovements\nkEUR b) 0 b) 156 b) 78\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nConsolidated net\n50% calculated at\nincome 2022-2024\nkEUR b) 0 b) 1,792 b) the end of 2024\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nTotal Shareholder\n40% calculated at\nReturn 2022-2024\nkEUR b) 0 b) 1,752 b) the end of 2024\n% a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nSustainability\nLTI targets 2022-2024 10% calculated at\n2022 kEUR b) 0 b) 358 b) the end of 2024\nEU Taxonomy % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\ncompliant\n50% calculated at\nrevenues, OpEx\nand CapEx kEUR b) 0 b) 179 b) the end of 2024\nDevelopment of % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be\nexecutive and 50% calculated at\npersonnel kEUR b) 0 b) 179 b) the end of 2024\n49\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDetermination of Target Achievement Tranche 2020:\nThe reference period for the 2020 LTI tranche expired on December 31, 2022.

The remuneration of the members\nof the Executive Board included in the table reflects the remuneration granted and due to\nthe respective Executive Board members in the reporting year and thus corresponds to\nthe value stated in the preceding remuneration tables in the column \"Remuneration\ngranted and due\" for the fiscal years 2021 and 2022 within the meaning of Section 162 (1)\nsentence 1 AktG. Where members of the Executive Board were only remunerated on a\npro rata basis in individual fiscal years, for example due to joining or leaving the company\nduring the year, the remuneration for this fiscal year was extrapolated to a full year to\nensure comparability.\nThe development of earnings is generally presented on the basis of the development of\nthe annual result of AIXTRON SE in accordance with Section 275 (3) No. 16 HGB (German\nCommercial Code). As the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board is also\nsignificantly dependent on the business success of the AIXTRON Group, the development\nof revenues, EBIT and net income for the year is also stated for the Group.\nThe comparison with the development of the average remuneration of employees is\nbased on the average remuneration of the workforce of the Group parent company\nAIXTRON SE in Germany. Since the employee and remuneration structures in the\nsubsidiaries are manifold, in particular in the case of employees abroad, it is appropriate\nfor the comparison of the development of the average remuneration to be based only on\nthe total workforce of AIXTRON SE. This comparison group was also used in the\nexamination of the appropriateness of the remuneration of the members of the Executive\nBoard. In this context, the remuneration of all employees of AIXTRON SE, including the\nleadership team and excluding student assistants, was taken into account. In order to\nensure comparability, the remuneration of part-time employees was extrapolated to full-\ntime equivalents.\n57\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nComparison of Annual Changes in Executive Board Remuneration\npursuant to Section 162 (1) no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n31.12.22 versus 31.12.21 versus\nAnnual change (in %) 31.12.21 31.12.20\nExecutive Board remuneration\nDr. Felix Grawert 18% 166%\nDr. Christian Danninger* 13% n.a.\nDr. Jochen Linck 18% 128%\nDr. Bernd Schulte** n.a. 113%\nEarnings development of AIXTRON SE and the Group\nGroup revenues 8% 59%\nGroup EBIT 6% 184%\nGroup net income 6% 175%\nAIXTRON SE income 6% 275%\nAverage remuneration of AIXTRON employees***\nEmployees of AIXTRON SE 3% 9%\n* Executive Board member since May 1, 2021, amount for 2021 annualized\n** Executive Board member until March 31, 2021, amount for 2021 annualized\n*** based on full-time equivalents\nStock Option Plans\nThe remuneration system described does not include any stock options.

The relevant\nshare price of AIXTRON SE for the LTI grant is EUR 28.206. It corresponds to the average of\nthe XETRA closing prices on all stock exchange trading days in the 4th quarter of 2022. The\ndegree of fulfillment of the performance criteria will be determined by the Supervisory\nBoard after the end of fiscal year 2025. At that time, the vested share awards will be\nconverted into non-forfeitable share awards depending on target achievement. After the\nexpiry of a 4-year vesting period for fiscal year 2023 ending on December 31, 2026, one\nshare of the Company will be transferred for each vested share award. This is to take\nplace in the week following the publication of the annual report.\n59\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Supervisory Board Members\nRemuneration of the Supervisory Board is regulated in Article 17 of AIXTRON’s Articles of\nAssociation.

In this report, we inform about the business\ndevelopment as well as the situation and the expected development of the AIXTRON\nGroup (hereinafter also referred to as “AIXTRON”, “AIXTRON Group”, or “the Group”) and\nAIXTRON SE (hereinafter also referred to as “the Company). The information regarding\nAIXTRON SE is contained in a separate section in the report on economic position with\ndisclosures in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB).\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European\nUnion, pursuant to section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). With the\nexception of the HGB disclosures in the chapter Management Report of AIXTRON SE, all\nfinancial figures contained in this Group Management Report, including the comparative\nfigures for the previous year, are reported in accordance with IFRS.\nDue to rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to\nthe totals indicated and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures for the\nsame reason.\n62\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFundamental Information on the Group\nBusiness Model\nAIXTRON’s business activities include the development, production and installation of\nequipment for the deposition of complex semiconductor materials, the development of\ndeposition processes on such equipment, consulting and training, customer support and\nservice for such equipment. AIXTRON also provides peripheral equipment and services for\nthe operation of its equipment.\nAIXTRON supplies deposition equipment for volume production as well as equipment for\nresearch and development (R&D) and pre-series production.\nThe demand for AIXTRON equipment is influenced by requirements for higher energy\nefficiency in power electronics, by the transformation towards electromobility, by\nincreasing transmission speeds and volumes of data, as well as by the use of 3D sensor\ntechnology in consumer electronics and in the automotive sector, and last but not least,\nby the use of innovative technologies like micro LEDs in displays. The ability of AIXTRON’s\ntechnologies to deposit thin material films precisely, enables manufacturers to improve\nperformance, yield and quality in the fabrication process of advanced power- and\noptoelectronic devices.\nOrganizational Structure\nLocations and Legal Corporate Structure\nThe AIXTRON Group comprises the parent company AIXTRON SE with its registered office\nin Herzogenrath, Germany, and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, AIXTRON SE\nheld direct and indirect stakes in 11 companies which are part of the AIXTRON Group, and\nwhich are fully consolidated:\nFacility location Use\nHerzogenrath, Germany Headquarters, R&D, Manufacturing, Sales, Service\nCambridge, United Kingdom R&D, Manufacturing, Service\nSanta Clara, CA, USA Sales, Service\nHwaseong, South Korea Sales, Service\nShanghai, China Sales, Service\nHsinchu, Taiwan Sales, Service\nTokio, Japan Sales, Service\nKulim, Malaysia Service\n63\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nManagement and Control\nAs a European stock company (Societas Europaea) the AIXTRON SE has a dual\nmanagement and control structure consisting of an Executive Board and a Supervisory\nBoard. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company at its own\nresponsibility while being advised and monitored by the Supervisory Board. In 2022, there\nwere the following personnel changes in the Company’s management and supervisory\nbodies:\nAt the Annual General Meeting on May 25, 2022, it was decided to expand the\nSupervisory Board from five to six members. Dr. Stefan Traeger, CEO of JENOPTIK AG, was\nelected as a new member of the Supervisory Board and Mr. Kim Schindelhauer, previous\nChairman of the Supervisory Board, was re-elected as Chairman. The composition of the\nExecutive Board has not changed compared to December 31, 2021.\nDetailed information on the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory\nBoard, the allocation of responsibilities between them, the operating procedures of the\nSupervisory Board committees and the Company‘s diversity concept can be found in the\nCorporate Governance Declaration, which is part of the annual report and also available\non the AIXTRON website at Declaration of Corporate Governance (www.aixtron.com/\ninvestoren/corporate-governance/en/corporate-governance-\nstatement/2022_Declaration_Corporate-Governance_EN.pdf).1\n1 The information in the Corporate Governance Declaration was made in accordance with the requirements of the German\nCorporate Governance Code 2022. They are to be classified as \"not related to the Management Report\" because they go\nbeyond the legal requirements and are therefore not part of the substantive audit by the auditor.\n64\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nTechnology and Products\nThe AIXTRON product range includes customer-specific systems for the deposition of\ncomplex semiconductor materials. Here, substrates of different materials and sizes can be\ncoated.\nThe MOCVD process (Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) is used to manufacture\ncomponents for power electronics or for optoelectronics from compound semiconductor\nmaterials.\nOur systems in the field of power electronics are used for the production of gallium\nnitride (GaN) semiconductor components, which, for example, increase the performance\nof chargers in consumer electronics, enable energy-saving power supply for servers and\ndata centers and efficient power conversion in the field of renewable energy. A second\nmajor field of application for power electronics are silicon carbide (SiC) components,\nwhich are used, for example, in the main inverters for electric vehicles, in their charging\ninfrastructure, and also in inverters for renewable energies (solar and wind). These\ncomponents are also manufactured by our customers using our CVD systems. Both GaN\nand SiC are material systems with a wide band gap (WBG) that are beginning to be\nincreasingly used in various areas of power electronics. In doing so, they contribute to the\ndecarbonization of our modern society and support climate protection.\nOn our systems in the field of optoelectronics, customers manufacture lasers for fast\noptical data transmission and for 3D sensors. The latter are increasingly used in\napplications that require recognition of the spatial context, e.g. in the environment\ndetection of robots or in autonomous vehicles. Another area of application is the\nproduction of LED picture elements (pixels) for display applications of the next\ngeneration, so-called micro LED displays. Other applications of our systems include the\nproduction of special LEDs, such as red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY) for automotive\nlighting and indoor farming, among others.\nAIXTRON works continuously to improve its existing technologies and products. Last year,\nAIXTRON presented the G10-SiC, the first system of the newly developed generations.\nThe G10-SiC is a system for the production of SiC components on both 150 mm and 200\nmm SiC wafers. In this generation of systems, the focus is not only on continuously\nimproving material performance, but also on further optimizing the systems for large-\nscale production through more automation with standard interfaces customary in the\nindustry, for example through the efficient use of limited clean room areas in\nsemiconductor factories.\nBusiness Processes\nManufacturing and Procurement\nAIXTRON produces its prototype and customer systems at its production sites in\nHerzogenrath and Cambridge. Production focuses on assembly, testing and qualification\nas well as commissioning of the systems according to standardized specifications.\nThe Group obtains the components required to manufacture the systems and the\nmajority of the pre-assembled assemblies from external suppliers and service providers.\n65\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe performance of our supply chains will be increased in order to cover the higher\noverall requirements and to compensate for fluctuating delivery capabilities. Based on a\nrolling forecast, the necessary measures to ensure material availability are taken in\ncoordination between sales, purchasing and production. This also includes the early\ndetection of bottlenecks in raw materials and components. Appropriate stock availability\nstrategies are applied together with supply chain partners.\nThe assembly of the systems is carried out with the help of external service providers in\nour own or, if necessary, in rented nearby production facilities. The subsequent\ncommissioning, testing and qualification of the systems is carried out by AIXTRON\nspecialists. The planning, control and monitoring of production is the sole responsibility of\nAIXTRON employees, thus enabling quality requirements to be met throughout the entire\nproduction process.\nIn 2022 or early 2023, AIXTRON successfully completed the market launch of the products\nG10-SiC and G10-AsP in series production.\nAIXTRON's production sites have a process-oriented quality management system certified\naccording to ISO 9001:2015. In 2021, external auditors have certified the quality\nmanagement systems of both AIXTRON SE and AIXTRON Ltd. confirmed without any\ndeviation.\nEmployees\nAIXTRON's leading position in the global market and its ability to continuously innovate\nare driven by the commitment and excellent knowledge of our employees. Our human\nresources management is therefore designed to create an inspiring, safe, and supportive\nenvironment, as well as to foster appreciative and cooperative interaction.\nAttracting and retaining highly qualified and committed specialists and managers is a key\nsuccess factor. Competing for the best talent, we are continuously enhancing our\nattractiveness as an employer brand. In addition to a comprehensive, informative careers\nsite and other communication channels, we use a wide variety of target group-oriented\nrecruitment channels, increasingly in social media. Personal contact with potential\napplicants at job fairs and similar events, as well as in the context of our close\ncooperation with universities worldwide, is also of great importance to us.\nAIXTRON is working consistently to establish a modern corporate culture with a mature\nleadership culture and good teamwork. We attach great importance to supporting our\nemployees competently and in a spirit of partnership, to promoting them individually,\nand to challenging them with future-oriented projects and tasks. As part of our company-\nwide personnel development concept, we offer our employees a wide range of measures\nfor continuous training as well as individual advanced training measures and\ndevelopment opportunities.\nAnother central pillar of our corporate culture is AIXTRON’s commitment to diversity and\nequal opportunities, which form an essential basis for our innovative strength and\ncompetitiveness. We explicitly encourage collaboration in mixed teams and between\ndifferent cultures and nationalities. We also attach great importance to an appropriate\ngender balance and a balanced age structure.\n66\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, the number of employees in the Group increased significantly by\napproximately 25% from 718 at the end of 2021 to 895 as at 31 December 2022. The\nsignificant increase in the number of headcount is due to the continued strong growth of\nthe Group's core business. As in previous years, the majority of employees are located in\nEurope.\nCustomers and Geographic Regions\nAIXTRON's customers include the power electronics, optoelectronics and display\nindustries. For example, they manufacture power semiconductor components for\napplications in IT infrastructure, in consumer electronics, in energy production and for use\nin the field of electromobility. In optoelectronics, they manufacture, among other things,\nlasers for data transmission, entertainment electronics and the automotive sector.\nCustomers from the display industry, on the other hand, concentrate, among other\nthings, on the production of new types of LEDs (mini and micro LEDs) in order to address\ndisplays of all sizes, from smartwatches to large-area display panels. The area of energy-\nsaving, WBG-based power electronics is gaining in importance in many application areas\nand is defining new standards, e.g. in energy conversion in household appliances or\nconsumer electronics.\nSome of these customers are vertically integrated and supply the entire value chain all\nthe way to the end consumer. Others are independent manufacturers of devices or of\nepitaxial wafers that supply products manufactured on AIXTRON systems to companies at\nthe next level in the value chain, the electronic component manufacturers. AIXTRON's\ncustomers also include research institutes and universities, where research into novel\nmaterials and new fields of application is being promoted.\nAIXTRON's products are sold worldwide. The market segments and the product mix are\nregionally different. Many large component manufacturers mainly produce in Asia.\nTherefore, the majority of AIXTRON's revenues are generated there. However,\nsemiconductor manufacturers are also increasingly expanding their production capacities\noutside of Asia, which can lead to corresponding changes in the regional distribution of\nrevenues.\nThe \"Development of Revenues\" chapter contains a detailed breakdown of revenues by\nregion.\nObjectives and Strategies\nWith the development, manufacture, sale and maintenance of systems for thin-film\ndeposition of complex materials, AIXTRON addresses growing future markets along many\nend-use fields, such as consumer electronics, IT infrastructure, the automotive industry,\ntelecommunications and power generation.\nIn the area of these complex deposition processes, AIXTRON's strategy is to develop the\ntechnology and products with a clear focus on its core competencies in such a way that\nthey address as many end applications as possible. Above all, it is about increasing\nproductivity and thus a high level of competitiveness in the specific requirement profile of\nthe respective application. In this way, AIXTRON is addressing the fast-growing end\n67\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nmarkets in order to generate income for the development of other promising future\napplications.\nTechnology Portfolio for Complex Material Deposition\nOur goal is to secure our market position in the focus markets in the long term through\ninnovation and technological leadership, as well as to expand the addressable end\napplications and expand to adjacent markets by applying our core competencies. Our\nstrategic planning focuses on the ecological and economic sustainability of the business,\nincreasing revenues and increasing profitability.\nThe core of AIXTRON's strategy lies in tailoring the products to the requirements of the\nrespective application areas while maintaining the focus on using AIXTRON's core\ncompetencies. This targeted addressing of the applications and markets that are\nattractive for AIXTRON in terms of size, growth, profitability and differentiation potential\nis currently very successful. Because these applications from different areas such as\nconsumer electronics, IT infrastructure and electromobility are subject to growth\ndynamics that are largely independent of one another. AIXTRON is not only dependent on\na single segment, but strives to be robust against fluctuations in individual application\nmarkets across the range of applications and the broadly diversified customer base. For\nthis purpose, AIXTRON is actively developing a broad technology portfolio through its own\nor funded developments, through cooperation or targeted acquisitions. The maintenance\nand development of technology ecosystems in close cooperation with customers and, if\nnecessary, their customers or technology partners allows AIXTRON to establish new\ntechnologies and develop new applications.\nThe focus is on markets in which the use of AIXTRON technology enables differentiation\nfrom the competition and is intended to offer customers decisive added value. This is\nachieved, among other things, by the homogeneity of the physical properties of the\ndeposited layers and thus a high yield on the wafer with simultaneous high throughput\n68\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nand low material and maintenance costs. An important differentiating factor is the high\nproductivity and cost-effectiveness of our systems, e.g. due to the high throughput of the\nsystems thanks to the so-called batch reactor, in which several wafers can be produced at\nthe same time. This allows our customers to allocate the direct and indirect system costs,\nsuch as costs for clean room space, to high production volumes. In many applications, the\nhigh efficiency of the use of materials due to the reactor architecture is another\nimportant cost factor. In markets that do not offer sufficient technical differentiation\npotential for the use of AIXTRON technologies, such as in the market for the production of\nblue and green LEDs, primarily in China, only low margins can be achieved.\nAIXTRON is pursuing a platform strategy with its system families based on the planetary\nprinciple. With a high proportion of identical parts, the systems can be customized. As\noutlined in the previous section, this enables broad diversification and the use of\nnumerous applications. In addition to the planetary systems, which address customers\nwith high production volumes, AIXTRON sells systems based on the showerhead principle\nin university and niche markets. AIXTRON makes this possible, e.g. to be involved early in\nthe development of newly emerging applications and to understand the emerging\ncustomer needs in new markets at an early stage.\nControl System\nSince numerous business activities within the group are largely integrated at the\noperational level, the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE controls the group at the level of\nthe overall group. The developments forecast for the Group by the Executive Board\ntherefore also apply to AIXTRON SE.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nThe most relevant performance indicators for the AIXTRON Group are order intake,\nrevenues, gross margin and earnings before interest and taxes relative to revenues (EBIT\nmargin). They are determined monthly in the AIXTRON reporting system and made\navailable to management in a comprehensive report. This enables the Executive Board to\nidentify growth drivers at an early stage, to analyze developments during the year and\ntake prompt countermeasures in the event of any discernible deviations.\nAIXTRON aims to achieve organic revenue growth, exchange rate effects are excluded\nwhen setting revenue targets. Order intake, as explained below in the section\n“Development of Orders”, reflects the investment behavior of the customers and thus\nserves as an early indicator for revenues. The period between receipt and delivery of an\norder for an MOCVD system is currently between nine and twelve months.\nGross margin, which expresses gross profit in relation to revenues, provides information\non the profitability and return on investment of AIXTRON’s operating business. The EBIT\nmargin is used as an additional important indicator for operational management and\nanalysis of the earnings situation.\nNon-Financial Performance Indicators\nSince the introduction of the new Executive Board remuneration system in fiscal year\n2020, AIXTRON has defined annual sustainability targets for the Executive Board as part\nof the Long Term Incentive (LTI), which are to be achieved over a three-year reference\n69\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nperiod, and includes corresponding non-financial performance indicators in the Group\nmanagement.\nNew non-financial performance indicators were defined for the LTI reference periods\nbeginning in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years. Essentially these are:\n• Percentage of ecologically sustainable revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and\noperating expenses (OpEx) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n• Strategic executive and personnel development, measured using defined quotas\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nIn addition to the R&D center at its headquarters in Herzogenrath, AIXTRON also operates\na R&D laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. These in-house laboratories are\nequipped with AIXTRON systems and are used to research and develop new equipment,\nmaterials and processes for the production of semiconductor structures.\nFocus on Innovation\nThe Group's R&D activities in 2022 again included development programs for future\ntechnologies and new products, as well as continuous improvement of AIXTRON's existing\nproducts. In order to increase industrial maturity, products were optimized along the\nentire value chain, e.g. through design improvements of externally supplied components\nor through improved data analysis. In addition, AIXTRON is working on customer-specific\ndevelopment projects and researching new technologies, often in the context of publicly\nfunded projects.\nThe Group’s R&D expertise remains of great strategic importance to AIXTRON, as we\nbelieve it ensures a competitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the\nfuture business development. AIXTRON invests specifically in research and development\nprojects in order to maintain or expand the Company’s leading position in MOCVD\nequipment for applications such as lasers, Micro LEDs, specialty LEDs and for the\nproduction of wide-band-gap materials for power electronics. In addition, the Group is\nworking on novel 2D-nanostructures, which are currently seen as having great potential in\nresearch.\nFor the consistent technological evolution of our product portfolio, we have invested EUR\n57.7 million, or 12% of revenues (2021: EUR 56.8 million, 13% of revenues), in research\nand development (R&D) in 2022. At year-end 2022, 254 of AIXTRON Group’s total 895\nemployees were engaged in research and development activities (2021: 223 of 718\nemployees).\nTechnology Protection through Patents\nAIXTRON aims to secure its technology by patenting and protecting inventions, provided\nit is strategically expedient for the Company to do so. As of December 31, 2022, the\nGroup had 252 (thereof AIXTRON SE: 237) patent families available (December 31, 2021:\n274 patent families). For 8 patent families (AIXTRON SE: 8), patent protection was\napplied. Usually, patent protection for inventions is applied for in those markets relevant\nto AIXTRON, specifically in Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United\nStates. AIXTRON's patent portfolio is evaluated annually and adjusted accordingly. The\n70\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nindividual patents expire between 2023 and 2042. In addition, AIXTRON continuously\nperforms a worldwide patent analysis in order to identify and assess changes in the\ncompetitive environment at an early stage.\nResearch Projects 2022\nTogether with our project partners, we again worked on promising research projects in\nthe reporting year. Here, too, we operate on a global scale and focus on areas with\nattractive growth potential.\nThe project \"GIMMIK\" aimed at increasing the production suitability of our technology for\nthe deposition of graphene and other 2D materials. In this project, we achieved an\nimprovement in MOCVD technology for graphene. In this way, we meet the international\nrequirements of a versatile, highly flexible key technology with frequently changing\ncustomer requirements, processes and products. The project was successfully completed\nin 2022.\nWe also successfully completed the research project \"UltimateGaN\" (Research for GaN\ntechnologies, devices and applications to address the challenges of the future GaN\nroadmap) in 2022, achieving all key project objectives. The successful testing and\nevaluation of the solution approaches took place in a near-production environment.\nAIXTRON's primary goal was to increase the production viability of MOCVD technology for\npower electronics and microwave applications in the energy, mobile communications and\nelectromobility markets.\nExamples of the Group's research work in 2022 include the \"YESvGaN\" and \"Transform\"\nprojects:\nThe project \"YESvGaN\" (Vertical GaN on Silicon: Wide Band Gap Power at Silicon Cost) is\ndeveloping a new class of gallium nitride (GaN)-based power transistors that will be both\naffordable and highly efficient. This will be achieved through so-called vertical GaN (vGaN)\ndiaphragm transistors, which are suitable for conversion at voltages up to 1200 volts and\nfor currents up to 100 amps. The development of these new transistors will involve\ninnovations in several parts of the semiconductor process chain, such as low-cost\nsubstrates for thick epitaxial layers, vertical membranes as active layers, or transistors\nwith multiple parallel channels.\nThe aim of the project \"TRANSFORM\" (Trusted European SiC Value Chain for a greener\nEconomy) is to establish a complete and competitive European supply chain for power\nelectronics based on silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors. It includes research and\ndevelopment activities along the entire value chain, from SiC substrates to power\nconverters, to provide European market players with a reliable source of SiC components\nand systems. The project consortium will use the G10-SiC AIXTRON Planetary Reactor® for\nSiC epitaxy on multiple 200mm substrates and develop advanced industrial-grade\nprocesses.\n71\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Economic Position\nGlobal Economy\nAs a manufacturer of capital goods, AIXTRON may be affected by the development of the\ngeneral economic environment, as this could impact its own suppliers, manufacturing\ncosts, and sales opportunities, driven by the customers' willingness to invest.\nMultiple challenges impacted and significantly slowed global economic development in\n2022. Global supply chains remained under pressure in the third year of the COVID-19\npandemic, due in particular to repeated large-scale lockdowns under China's zero COVID\npolicy. In addition, the Russian attack on Ukraine from late February caused further\nsevere dislocations in the global economic cycle. Far-reaching international sanctions\nmeant that important Russian raw materials, particularly in the energy sector, were no\nlonger available, leading to corresponding shortages and drastic price increases. The\nresulting sharp rise in general inflation rates prompted the central banks, above all the\nU.S. Federal Reserve, to react. With a series of significant key interest rate increases to\nfight inflation, they implemented the already announced monetary policy tightening\nmuch faster and more extensively than expected. The combination of material shortages,\nrising prices and rising interest rates confronted consumers, companies and countries\nwith adjustment processes that were as difficult as they were severe, resulting in the\nshort term above all in slower economic activities.\nAgainst this backdrop, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast in its January 2023\nWorld Economic Outlook Update (WEO) significantly lower growth in global economic\noutput in 2022 of 3.4%, down from 6.2% in 2021. The guidance for 2023 at 2.9% is\n0.2 percentage points higher than it was in the October 2022 WEO. For the industrialized\nnations, the expected growth rate for 2022 is 2.7% (2021: 5.4%), expected to decline to\n1.2% in 2023. The expected growth rate for the emerging and developing countries in\n2022 is 3.9% (2021: 6.7%) projected to rise modestly to 4.0% in 2023. Expectations for\nworld trade volume in 2022 were 5.4% (2021: 10.4%) declining to 2.4% in 2023, while\nglobal inflation is expected to have nearly doubled to 8.8% (2021: 4.7%) falling again to\n6.6% in 2023.1\nThe strongly export-oriented German machinery and equipment engineering sector also\nsuffered from increasing reluctance of customers to invest over the course of the year\ndue to the increased economic uncertainties. According to reports from the German\nEngineering Federation (VDMA), companies recorded a price adjusted decline in incoming\norders of 4% in 2022. Orders from abroad declined by 4%, while domestic orders\ndecreased by 5%.2\n1 IMF: World Economic Outlook Update, January 2023\n2 VDMA: Order intake in machinery and plant engineering, December 2022\n72\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDemand for AIXTRON's products remains largely dependent on industry-specific\ndevelopments, such as the introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, IT\ninfrastructure, electromobility, or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor\nmarket. These developments are based on the megatrends of digitalization,\nelectrification, and sustainability and thus continued to be very robust.\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rate initially strengthened significantly under the impact of the\nU.S. Federal Reserve's rapid and aggressive action to combat inflation in 2022. It had\nalready fallen below parity with the Euro in August and at the end of September, one\neven had to pay less than 0.96 USD/EUR. By then the US dollar had appreciated by more\nthan 15% in the course of the year. It was not until the European Central Bank (ECB) also\ntook strong interest rate steps and the ECB announced that it would continue to fight\ninflation consistently that the Euro slowly recovered from its lows by the end of\nDecember. As a result, the US dollar closed the year at 1.0674 USD/EUR on December 30,\n2022 (2021: 1.1372 USD/EUR), appreciating by around 6% overall. AIXTRON applied an\naverage USD/ EUR exchange rate of 1.06 USD/EUR in fiscal year 2022 (Q1/2022: 1.13\nUSD/EUR; Q2/2022: 1.08 USD/EUR; Q3/2022: 1.02 USD/EUR; Q4/2022: 1.00 USD/EUR).\nOn average over the year, the exchange rate was thus significantly below the prior-year\naverage (2021: 1.19 USD/EUR). Compared to the previous year, this had a\ncorrespondingly positive impact on the Group’s US-dollar-denominated revenues.\nAIXTRON’s Executive Board continues to carefully monitor the developments of the global\neconomy and the financial markets to decide what can potentially be done to mitigate\nnegative external effects on AIXTRON’s business. The global crisis situations and market\ndevelopments continued to have only a minor overall impact on AIXTRON's business.\nLogistics and supply chains were tense, but remained stable overall in the view of\nAIXTRON's Executive Board. In 2022, no forward exchange contracts or other hedging\ntransactions were entered into. Therefore, no currency hedging contracts were in place as\nof December 31, 2022. The Executive Board reserves the right to carry out hedging\ntransactions in the future, should this be deemed appropriate.\nCompetitive Positioning\nCompetitors in the market for CVD/MOCVD equipment are Veeco Instruments, Inc. (USA,\n“Veeco”), Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan, “TNS”), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan, “TEL”),\nAdvanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. (China, “AMEC”), Tang Optoelectronics\nEquipment Corporation Limited (China, “TOPEC”) as well as ASM International N.V.\n(Netherlands) (“ASMI”) and Nuflare Technology Inc. (Japan, “Nuflare”). Other companies\nare also continuing to try to qualify their own MOCVD-systems with their customers. For\nexample, Technology Engine of Science Co. Ltd. (South Korea, “TES”), Zhejiang Jingsheng\nMechanical (China, “JSG”) and HERMES Epitek (Taiwan, “HERMES”) are working on the\ndevelopment of their own MOCVD system solutions and are trying to establish them in\nthe market.\nAccording to a study by the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON has extended its\nglobal market leadership for MOCVD tools in 2021. AIXTRON again holds the top spot:\nAIXTRON's market share has increased to 75% (2020: 58%), followed by AMEC (China)\nwith 14% (2020: 16%) and Veeco (USA) with 11% (2020: 26%). At the same time, the\nglobal market for MOCVD tools grew 28% year-on-year from USD 438 million to USD 561\n73\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nmillion in 2021. For fiscal year 2022, no current market share figures from independent\nmarket analysts are yet available.\nKey Target Markets\nMarket For Power Semiconductors Based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) Materials\nGallium Nitride (Gan) and Silicon Carbide (SiC)\nPower semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials are one of the main\napplications of AIXTRON's deposition technology. These materials enable the production\nof very compact and highly efficient power supplies and AC/DC as well as DC/DC\nconverters which are used, for example, in the industrial space for applications such as\npower supplies of modern data centers, the more efficient feed-in of regenerative\nenergies into the power grid and in electromobility. They are therefore increasingly used\nin a broad spectrum of applications covering a wide power range. WBG power\nsemiconductors reduce conversion losses by up to 40% and thus contribute significantly\nto increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO emissions. There are two main groups of\n2\ncommercially available WBG power semiconductors: GaN (gallium nitride) and SiC (silicon\ncarbide).\nMarket for Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power Semiconductors\nGaN semiconductor devices are used primarily in low and medium power and voltage\nclasses, such as in power supplies for smartphones and laptops, and in power supplies for\ndata centers. The market volume for GaN semiconductor devices in 2021 exceeded USD\n100 million, highlighting the increasing market acceptance of GaN technology in the\npower semiconductor sector. For example, there is already a wide range of commercially\navailable 65W power supplies that use GaN technology and are marketed as such. In\naddition, customers are continuously opening up new applications, for example in the\nfield of data centers, in IT infrastructure as well as in micro inverters in the field of\nphotovoltaics or on-board chargers in the field of electromobility. In addition, the\ncustomer base for AIXTRON's GaN semiconductor equipment is continuously expanding,\nwhile existing customers are increasing their production capacities.\nDue to the wide range of applications, analysts of the Yole Group (Yole) expect the\nmarket for GaN power semiconductors to grow very strongly, from USD 126 million in\n2021 to USD 2.0 billion in 2027, corresponding to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\nof around 60%.\nFurthermore, GaN semiconductor devices are increasingly used in high-frequency\napplications. In 5G telecom networks and likely in subsequent network generations such\nas 6G, the GaN technology advantage of lower power losses at high frequencies comes\ninto play. As a result, more and more manufacturers are switching their production of\nhigh-frequency switches from silicon to GaN. Yole analysts forecast the GaN high-\nfrequency semiconductor device market to grow from USD 891 million in 2020 to USD 2.4\nbillion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%.\n74\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMarket for Silicon Carbide (SiC) Power Semiconductors\nThe adoption of SiC power semiconductors in the area of high-voltage and high-power\napplications has increased further in 2022. The main fields of application within\nelectromobility are in particular the main inverters in the powertrain as well as the on-\nboard chargers, but also the charging stations, as well as the inverters in the field of\nindustrial photovoltaics and wind energy. SiC is also used in industrial motor control\nsystems. In all these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in conversion losses\nduring the conversion of electrical energy. This leads, for example, to a greater range per\nbattery charge in battery electric vehicles and to lower conversion losses in the field of\npower generation.\nDriven by significantly increased awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and\nCO reduction, both in the regulatory and private sectors, as well as by bans imposed in\n2\nseveral countries on the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines from 2035\nonwards, car manufacturers worldwide have raised their targets for powertrain\nelectrification.\nBased on this development, Yole forecasts that the SiC device market will grow from USD\n1 billion in 2021 to USD 6.3 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 34%. According to the analysts,\nthis is particularly due to the development of electric vehicles and the corresponding fast\ncharging infrastructure.\nLED Market\nRed, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) are used in Mini LED displays, among other\nthings, for large-format color displays in sports stadiums, airports and shopping malls, as\nwell as in automotive taillights or in the area of indoor farming. In addition, televisions\nand monitors in the premium segment are increasingly being equipped with Mini LEDs for\nbacklighting as an alternative to OLED displays. The market for infrared and ROY LED\nmanufacturing equipment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% through 2027, according\nto Yole. The annual growth of the wafer area amounts to approx. 7%, as the size of the\nchips used is significantly reduced compared to backlight applications. The largest growth\nis expected in the area of fine pitch displays, which are applications with pixel sizes of less\nthan 1 mm. According to Yole, these are expected to grow by an average of 34% per year\nin the same period.\nThe market for UV LEDs (Ultra-Violet Light Emitting Diodes) is another specialized\nsegment in the LED market that AIXTRON addresses. UV LEDs are used for curing plastics\nand disinfecting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking) water. Due to the increasing\ndemand for hygiene, this market is expected to gain importance in the future. After an\ninitial strong increase in demand for mass production systems for UV LEDs in the first\nyears of the COVID pandemic, this has been significantly reduced to tools for\ndevelopment and small series production in the past year. Nevertheless, UV LEDs are a\nproduct segment with very specific applications such as air disinfection systems, vehicle\nair conditioning or sterilization of running water.\n75\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMarket for Micro LEDs\nMicro LEDs form a basis for new types of displays. Analysts expect Micro LEDs to be used\ninitially in very small displays such as smartwatches and very large displays such as large-\nscreen premium TVs. In the long term, other potential applications include displays in\nsmartphones, tablets and notebooks. Micro LED technology is currently still in the early\nstages of development but has seen very large investments in the recent past. Market\nresearchers at Yole estimate total cumulative industry investments to date amounting to\napproximately USD 8.3 billion and predict that all companies combined will invest\napproximately USD 3 billion in manufacturing capacity by 2025. According to Yole, this\nequates to an increase in demand for Micro LED epiwafers to 0.5 million 6-inch wafers per\nyear in 2025 and up to 3.9 million 6-inch wafers per year in 2029.\nAs Micro LED technology matures, AIXTRON expects the currently still very young market\nfor Micro LEDs to mature both technically and commercially. Developments are currently\nfocusing on the cost per pixel, as well as on the yield and quality of the industrial\nmanufacturing process. Accordingly, analysts also expect the initial commercial\nintroductions in the area of high-end applications and a subsequent continuous expansion\nof the applications across other segments.\nMarket for Laser-based Optical Data Transmission\nThe volume of data transmitted via fiber optic cables continues to grow, driven by the\nincreasing use of cloud computing and Internet services in particular during the COVID\npandemic. Especially the growing use of video-on-demand, as well as the communication\nof networked devices via the Internet (“Internet of Things”) contribute to increasing data\nvolumes. In addition to the data volumes, the enormously fast transmission at the speed\nof light for optical data transmission also plays a major role. Lasers, which are\nmanufactured on AIXTRON equipment, are key components for high-speed optical data\ntransmission. The growth in global data traffic due to mobile telecommunications, the\nswitch to 5G standards, and continuous build out of glass fiber networks, increase the\ndemand for lasers as optical signal generators, photodiodes as receivers, and optical\namplifiers and switches.\nMarket research firms such as Yole and Strategies Unlimited expect investment in laser-\nbased communications to continue to increase to accommodate growing data traffic. For\nthis reason, market research firm Yole predicts that revenues from transceivers used in\ntelecommunications will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% from 2021 to\n2027. The total market volume in 2027 is forecast by Yole to exceed USD 24.7 billion. Yole\nalso expects demand for the laser diodes used for this purpose to rise sharply by 2026,\nand now assumes that data communications will be the biggest demand driver over the\nnext five years.\nLaser-based 3D Sensor Market\nLaser-based 3D sensors are often used in high-end mobile phones. Since this technology\nwas introduced to the market with the iPhone X in 2017, Apple has been using it in its\ncurrent generation smartphones and is also using it in its tablet series. With these\nsensors, the environment can be captured in three dimensions, which is important for\nmany applications, e. g. augmented reality. Consumer electronics will therefore be a\n76\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nsignificant demand driver for laser-based 3D sensors in the next few years, according to\nmarket research company Yole. Their analysts expect surface emitting lasers to grow from\nUSD 1.4 billion in 2021 to USD 3.9 billion in 2027, growing at a CAGR of 19%.\nIn addition to consumer electronics applications, edge and surface emitting lasers are\nincreasingly being used in 3D sensing for the industrial and automotive sectors. Yole\nexpects a strong increase in demand for these devices by 2026.\nBusiness Development\nFiscal year 2022 was dominated by significant geopolitical events with serious\nmacroeconomic impacts. Disrupted supply chains, energy crisis, inflation, the shortage of\nskilled workers or the COVID-19 pandemic are just a few examples of external factors that\nmany people and companies had to deal with. We successfully met these challenges by\nintroducing targeted measures at an early stage. As a result, we were able to recruit many\nnew colleagues and still achieve our revenues forecast despite delays in the granting of\nexport licenses. Demand for our equipment and in particular our G10-SiC remained very\nstrong. Our profitability also developed as we expected. Accordingly, we also met all\nother key figures of our guidance, which was increased in the course of the year.\nIn particular, a strong increase in demand for AIXTRON’s Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium\nNitride (GaN) energy efficient power as well as Micro LED device production equipment\ncharacterized the reporting year. AIXTRON’s other products also experienced strong\ndemand in 2022, for example, systems for the production of lasers for optical data\ncommunication and 3D sensing, as well as systems for LEDs. With orders totaling EUR\n585.9 million (2021: EUR 497.3 million), we recorded an 18% increase in order volume in\nthe fiscal year 2022. As expected, revenues also developed very positively and, at EUR\n463.2 million (2021: EUR 429.0 million), were despite the delayed granting of export\nlicenses within our guidance range. At 42%, the gross margin met the expectations. The\nincreased operating expenses of EUR 90.6 million included higher variable compensation\ncomponents as well as higher fixed personnel cost and increased expenses for Research\nand Development. The operating result was EUR 104.7 million with an EBIT margin of 23%\n(2021: EUR 99.0 million; 23%). This resulted in a net profit of EUR 100.5 million (2021:\nEUR 94.8 million). For 2022, a free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities -\ninvestments + proceeds from disposals adjusted for changes in financial assets) of EUR 7.7\nmillion (2021: EUR 48.7 million) was reported.\nDuring 2022, AIXTRON has been actively pursuing the renewal of its product portfolio and\nthe new G10-SiC tool was successfully launched in the reporting year, while the new G10-\nAsP tool was introduced to the market in early 2023. In addition, we were able to acquire\nfurther well-known customers for our deposition technology for the efficient large-scale\nproduction of high-performance SiC power electronics. In order to secure a sustainable\nprofitable development of the AIXTRON Group, our product portfolio focuses exclusively\non product lines with a positive earnings contribution or those that promise a significant\nreturn on investment (ROI) in the foreseeable future.\n77\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\n%\nmillion million million\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 585.9 497.3 88.6 18\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 351.8 214.6 137.2 64\nIn fiscal year 2022, US dollar-denominated order intake and order backlog have been\nrecorded at the budget exchange rate of 1.20 USD/EUR (2021: 1.25 USD/EUR). Spares &\nservice orders are not included in the order backlog.\nIn 2022, total order intake including spares & services stood at EUR 585.9 million, thus\nsignificantly higher than the previous year’s figure. This development was driven in\nparticular by continuously strong demand from power electronics and micro LEDs. In\nQ4/2022, order intake was booked at EUR 160.3 million and with that was up 12% against\nthe previous quarter (Q3/2022: EUR 142.8 million).\nAt EUR 351.8 million, equipment order backlog as of December 31, 2022, was also higher\nthan the order backlog of EUR 214.6 million at the end of 2021 (2022 budget rate: 1.20\nUSD/EUR; 2021 budget rate: 1.25 USD/EUR). Compared to the end of the previous\nquarter, the order backlog decreased due to the high number of shipments in the fourth\nquarter by 5% at year-end (September 30, 2022: EUR 369.4 million).\nIn line with strict internal procedures, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These\nconditions include the following requirements:\n1. the receipt of a firm written purchase order\n2. the receipt or securing of the agreed down payment\n3. accessibility to the required shipping documentation\n4. a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Executive Board\nreserves the right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is\nsufficiently likely to occur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, the Executive\nBoard comes to the conclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or\ninvolves an unacceptable degree of risk, it will exclude this specific order or a portion of\nthis order from the recorded order intake and order backlog figures until the risk has\ndecreased to an acceptable level. Such Risk factors include, for example, technological\nrisks in orders for new product generations or delays in the granting of export licenses.\nThe order backlog is regularly assessed and – if necessary – adjusted in line with potential\nexecution risks.\n78\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal year 2022 amounted to EUR 463.2 million and were thus about 8%\nhigher than in the previous year (2021: EUR 429.0 million). EUR 82.8 million or 18% of\nrevenues in fiscal year 2022 were generated from the sale of consumables, spare parts\nand services (2021: 15%). Revenues with MOCVD systems rose by around 4% year-on-\nyear. In particular, the strong increase in demand for MOCVD equipment for the\nproduction of SiC power devices led to an increase of equipment revenues in the power\nelectronics segment. Demand from the application field of LEDs, including Micro LEDs, led\nto corresponding growth in this area as well. The proportion of application field revenues\ndeveloped as following: Power electronics contributed 42% of equipment revenues,\nfollowed by optoelectronics with 28% and LEDs including Micro LEDs with 27%.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\n% % %\nmillion million million\nEquipment revenues 380.4 82 366.5 85 13.9 4\nService, spare parts, etc. 82.8 18 62.4 15 20.3 33\nTotal 463.2 100 429.0 100 34.2 8\nWith EUR 316.1 million or 68%, demand from customers in Asia continued to account for\nthe majority of total revenues in 2022 (2021: 70%).

This resulted in\na gross profit of EUR 195.3 million (2021: EUR 181.5 million) in the fiscal year, which\ncorresponds to a gross margin of 42% (2021: 42%).\nDevelopment of Results\n2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\nmillion % Rev. million % Rev. million %\nCost of sales 267.9 58 247.5 58 20.4 8\nGross profit 195.3 42 181.5 42 13.8 8\nOperating expenses 90.6 20 82.5 19 8.1 10\nSelling Expenses 11.2 2 10.0 2 1.2 12\nGeneral and\n29.2 6 25.4 6 3.8 15\nadministration expenses\nResearch and\n57.7 12 56.8 13 0.9 2\ndevelopment costs\nNet other operating\n-7.6 -2 -9.7 -2 2.1 -22\nexpenses (income)\nOperating Expenses\nIn absolute terms, operating expenses increased significantly during 2022 compared to\nthe previous year, but only slightly in relation to revenue development. In absolute terms,\noperating expenses increased to EUR 90.6 million in the year 2022 compared to EUR 82.5\nmillion in the past fiscal year. Higher personnel cost due to the increased staff as well as\nhigher variable remuneration components contributed to the increase in expenses. In\naddition, R&D expenditures increased as well, while the previous year´s income from\ngovernment grants was higher.\nThe following individual effects must be taken into account:\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were higher in a year-on-year\ncomparison at EUR 40.4 million (2021: EUR 35.4 million). In proportion to revenues, SG&A\nexpenses amounted to 9% (2021: 8%). The development was mainly attributable to\nhigher variable remuneration components and personnel cost.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses, including expenses for development\nactivities for our new generations of systems, increased slightly by 2% year-on-year to\nEUR 57.7 million (2021: EUR 56.8 Mio.). In fiscal year 2022, AIXTRON has both driven the\ncompletion of new product generations and already started to invest in the development\nof next generation products.\n80\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nKey R&D Information\n2022 vs.\n2022 2021 2021\nR&D expenses (in EUR million) 57.7 56.8 2%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 12 13 -1 pp\nNet other operating income and expenses in 2022 resulted in an income of EUR 7.6\nmillion (2021: operating income of EUR 9.7 million).\nIn the reporting year, other operating income including grants for publicly funded\ndevelopment projects decreased from EUR 8.9 million in 2021 to EUR 5.3 million, which\nwas largely due to the completion of a major funding project. In fiscal year 2022, a net\nforeign exchange gain of EUR 2.8 million (2021: EUR 1.2 million gain) was recorded from\ntransactions in foreign currencies and the translation of balance sheet items.\nAt EUR 91.1 million, personnel costs in fiscal year 2022 were 15% higher than the EUR\n79.3 million in 2021. This increase was mainly due to higher variable remuneration\ncomponents and increased costs in-line with the higher headcount.\nOperating Result (EBIT)\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved year-on-year by 6% and amounted to EUR 104.7\nmillion in the fiscal year 2022 (2021: EUR 99.0 million). This resulted in an EBIT margin of\n23% (2021: 23%). This development is mainly attributable to the year-on-year increase in\nrevenues and related gross margin and is thus related to the business- and cost\ndevelopments described above.\nResult before Tax\nResult before tax at EUR 105.1 million in 2022 was higher than in the previous year\n(2021: EUR 98.9 million).

Capital expenditures mainly included\nlaboratory equipment and expansions. In addition, rights of use for leased space were\ncapitalized.\nGoodwill was EUR 72.5 million compared to EUR 72.3 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe difference is entirely related to exchange rate fluctuations. No impairment losses\nwere recognized.\nOther intangible assets increased to EUR 3.3 million as of 31 December 2022 (31\nDecember 2021: EUR 2.2 million), due to investments in software and IT-solutions.\nInventories, including components and work in process, increased by EUR 103.0 million\nyear-on-year to EUR 223.6 million (December 31, 2021: EUR 120.6 million), pointing at\nthe high number of deliveries planned in subsequent quarters. The inventory turnover\nrate at the end of 2022 was 1.2 (2021: 2.0).\nTrade receivables were EUR 119.7 million at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021:\nEUR EUR 81.0 million), reflecting the high volume of shipments in the fourth quarter of\n2022. The current days sales outstanding was 30 days at the end of 2022 compared to 23\ndays at the end of 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets decreased to EUR 325.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 (31. December 2021: EUR 352.5 million). The decrease is mainly due\nto the build-up of inventories reflecting the higher business volume, and to the increase\nin receivables resulting from a disproportionately strong revenue contribution of the last\nquarter.\nAs of December 31, 2022, other financial assets include fund investments of EUR 220.4\nmillion (December 31, 2021: EUR 141.6 million). In previous year, there were also short-\nterm bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million.\nLiabilities\nTrade payables increased to EUR 46.1 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31,\n2021: EUR 19.6 million), due to the increased procurement volume.\nProvisions (non-current and current) increased from EUR 31.8 million as of December 31,\n2021, to EUR 36.1 million as of December 31, 2022. This was due on the one hand to a\n82\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nhigh number of systems being shipped with including the respective warranty provisions,\nand on the other hand to higher provisions for variable remuneration.\nAt EUR 141.2 million as of December 31, 2022, advance payments received from\ncustomers were significantly above the previous year's level (December 31, 2021: EUR\n77.0 million), reflecting the currently strong order levels.\nOther current liabilities include payments received for publicly funded development\nprojects and increased slightly year-on-year to EUR 6.6 million (December 31, 2021: EUR\n6.4 million).\nFinancial Position\nPrincipals and Objectives of Financial Management\nAIXTRON has a central financial management system whose primary objective is to\nensure the long-term financial strength of the Group. AIXTRONs financial management\nincludes the control of its global liquidity as well as its interest and currency management.\nFinancial processes and responsibilities are defined throughout the Group. The\ninvestment policy is approved by the Supervisory Board.\nOur capital structure management aims to determine an appropriate capital structure for\neach company within the Group while minimizing costs and risks. An appropriate\nstructure must comply with tax, legal and commercial requirements. The Group increases\nor decreases the capital in line with the strategic orientation of the companies.\nOur liquidity management aims to ensure the effective management of cash flows within\neach company of the group. The central finance department and local management\nmonitor the cash flows within the group on a daily basis and take corrective action where\nnecessary. Financing requirements are covered by cash within the group, either through\nintra-group loans or through changes in equity.\nThe principles of the investment policy are determined by the Executive Board and\napproved by the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE. Excess cash is invested by the finance\ndepartment in accordance with this policy. The policy only allows for low-risk\ninvestments.\nDue to its global business operations, AIXTRON generates a portion of its revenues in\nforeign currencies, i. e. in currencies other than the Euro. The most prevalent foreign\ncurrency relevant for AIXTRON is the US dollar. The associated exchange rate risk is\nmonitored by the central finance department and taken into account as part of liquidity\nmanagement. Speculative foreign currency transactions are not entered into.\nIn the semiconductor equipment industry, it is essential to have sufficient cash and cash\nequivalents at all times in order to be able to quickly finance possible business expansion.\nAIXTRON’s current cash requirements are generally covered by cash inflows from\noperating activities. The Company can draw on a high level of cash and cash equivalents\nand other short-term investments to secure further corporate financing and to support its\nindispensable research and development activities. In addition, AIXTRON has the option,\nif necessary and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue financial\ninstruments on the capital market to cover additional capital requirements.\n83\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinancing\nThe equity ratio decreased slightly mainly due to the significantly increased total value of\nadvance payments from customers and the correspondingly higher balance sheet total\ncompared to the previous year and amounted to 73% as of December 31, 2022 compared\nto 80% as of December 31, 2021.\nThe share capital of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 113,348,420 as of December 31, 2022\n(December 31, 2021: EUR 113,292,020). It is divided into 113,348,420 no-par value\nregistered common shares with a pro rata amount of share capital of EUR 1.00 per share.\nAll shares are fully paid in. The increase in share capital is attributable to the shares issued\nin the fiscal year under stock option programs. In fiscal year 2022, 56,400 stock options\nfrom past stock option programs were exercised (2021: 364,700 options) and no new\nstock options were issued (2021: 0 options).\nAIXTRON ordinary shares\n31.12.2022 Exercised Expired Allocation 31.12.2021\nStock options to acquire shares 112,100 56,400 14,000 0 182,500\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, AIXTRON did not have any bank borrowings.\nTo safeguard advance payments received from customers for orders, the Group had bank\nguarantee lines amounting to EUR 105.2 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 70.1\nmillion), of which EUR 49.8 million (2021: EUR 24.7 million) had been utilized as of the\nreporting date.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the year 2022, AIXTRON´s total capital expenditures amounted to EUR 49.2 million\n(2021: EUR 97.6 million).\nDriven by the Group's growth, EUR 27.4 million (2021: EUR 16.4 million) was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2022. These investments include additional\ntest and demonstration facilities as well as the expansion of production and development\nareas. In addition EUR 79.6 million were invested in fund investments while fixed-term\nbank deposits were reduced by EUR 60.0 million (2021: EUR 80.1 million investments in\nfund investments; no change in fixed-term deposits). EUR 2.3 million were invested in\nintangible assets including software licenses (2021: EUR 1.1 million).\nAll capital expenditures in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were self-financed.\n84\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nEUR million\nDescription Balance sheet item 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 + / -\nBank deposits Cash and Cash equivalents 104.8 150.9 -46.1\nShort-term bank deposits (term of\nOther financial assets 0.0 60.0 -60.0\n3 to max. 12 months)\nFund investments Other financial assets 220.4 141.6 78.8\nTotal liquiditiy 325.2 352.5 -27.3\nCash and cash equivalents including other financial assets decreased to EUR 325.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 352.5 million). As of December\n31, 2022, other financial assets exclusively included fund investments totaling EUR 220.4\nmillion (2021: EUR 141.6 million). Bank deposits, primarily in euros, with a maturity of less\nthan twelve months in the amount of EUR 60.0 million were included in the previous year\nbalance (see also “Investments”).\nThere are no restrictions on access to the Company's cash and cash equivalents.\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 37.1 million in fiscal year 2022\n(2021: EUR 66.4 million). This is mainly the result of the current year's earnings. This was\noffset by the effects of the increase in inventories and the higher level of receivables as of\nthe reporting date. In the previous year, investments in funds amounting to EUR 79.9\nmillion were reported in cash flow from operating activities. From fiscal year 2022, these\nwill be recognized retrospectively in cash flow from investing activities.\nCash flow from investing activities in the 2022 fiscal year was EUR -48.3 million (2021:\nEUR -97.4 million). This figure is mainly attributable to investments in laboratory plant\nand equipment and fund investments (see also “Investments”).\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -34.6 million in 2022 (2021: EUR\n-8.6 million). The main drivers were the dividend payment of EUR -33.7 million (2021: EUR\n-12.3 million) and repayments of lease liabilities EUR -1.5 million, (2021: EUR -1.0 million).\nCash inflows from the issue of new shares under stock option programs were of EUR 0.7\nmillion (2021: EUR 4.8 million).\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments + proceeds from\ndisposals adjusted for changes in financial assets) for the 2022 fiscal year was EUR 7.7\nmillion compared to EUR 48.7 million in 2021. The difference compared to the previous\nyear is mainly related to the increase in inventories and higher investments in property,\nplant and equipment and intangible assets.\nManagement Assessment of Company Situation\nIn fiscal year 2022, AIXTRON continued to focus on successfully serving the targeted\ngrowth markets with sustainable profitability. At the same time, the Group continued to\ndrive development and sales activities, particularly for power electronics equipment and\nfor the production of Mini and Micro LED displays.\n85\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEquipment revenues in 2022 amounted to EUR 380.4 million, of which EUR 160.6 million\n(42 %) was generated by MOCVD/CVD equipment for the production of power electronics\ndevices (GaN/SiC), EUR 106.2 million (28%) by MOCVD equipment for the area of\noptoelectronics (laser, solar and telecom) and EUR 103.2 million (27%) for the area of\nLEDs including Micro LEDs. Further fundamental growth is expected in the\naforementioned end markets, as modern power electronics devices are increasingly\nbased on SiC or GaN material systems. The use of lasers in optical data transmission and\n3D sensor technology also continues to increase and and new types of micro LED displays\nwill increasingly be used commercially.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned activities, there is a focus on the costs as well as the\nmargin contributions of individual revenue drivers. Furthermore, the Executive Board\ncontinuously reviews the product portfolio with a view to changing framework\nconditions, such as time windows for the market launch of new technologies or\nevaluation of our customers' product requirements.\nFiscal year 2022 developed very positively in all markets addressed by our core\ntechnology. Management expects further revenue growth in the future, driven by the\nmegatrends of digitalization, electromobility, energy efficiency and environmental\nsustainability.\nIn this context, the AIXTRON Group maintains a healthy financing structure with a high\nlevel of cash and cash equivalents and without any bank debt.\nAchievement of Guidance in 2022\nThe order intake, revenue, gross margin and EBIT margin forecasts for fiscal 2022\npublished in the Annual Report 2021 and adjusted in conjunction with the publication of\nthe third quarter report were fully met:\nOutlook FY 2022 1st quarter 2022 2nd quarter 2022 3rd quarter 2022 Result 2022\n24.02.2022 05.05.2022 28.07.2022 27.10.2022 28.02.2023\nIncrease:\nRange of\nRange of\nOrder Intake* EUR 520m to Confirmation Confirmation EUR 586 million\nEUR 540m to\nEUR 580m\nEUR 600m\nRange of\nRevenues* EUR 450m to Confirmation Confirmation Confirmation EUR 463 million\nEUR 500m\nIncrease:\nGross Margin around 41% Confirmation Confirmation 42%\naround 42%\nIncrease:\nEBIT Margin* around 21-23% Confirmation Confirmation 23%\naround 22-24%\n*At constant budget exchange rate of 1.20 USD/EUR\n86\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nManagement Report of AIXTRON SE\nSupplementary Explanations According to HGB\nThe management report of AIXTRON SE and the Group management report of the\nAIXTRON Group are combined according to Section 315 Para. 5 HGB in conjunction with\nSection 298 Para. 2 HGB.

Revenues were influenced by continued high demand for MOCVD systems in the\nfields of GaN- and SiC-power electronics, wireless and optical data communication as well\nas LED applications. The other revenues are attributable to intra-group charges.\nRevenues by category\n2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\nmillion % million % million %\nEquipment revenues 350.1 81 332.3 84 17.8 5\nService and spare\n76.4 18 57.1 14 19.3 34\nparts\nOther revenues 5.6 1 6.7 2 -1.1 -16\nTotal 432.1 100 396.2 100 35.9 9\nRevenues by region\n2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nin EUR in EUR in EUR\nmillion % million % million %\nAsian 299.2 69 277.7 70 21.5 8\nEurope 63.5 15 87.5 22 -23.9 -27\nAmericas 69.4 16 31.0 8 38.4 124\nTotal 432.1 100 396.2 100 35.9 9\nAt 69%, demand from customers based in Asia still accounted for the largest share of\ntotal revenues in 2022.\nAt EUR 84.6 million (2021: EUR 89.7 million), the net result for the year was slightly\nlower than in the previous year. The following factors contributed to this development:\nAt 50%, the cost of materials ratio (cost of materials in relation to total output) was\nunchanged (2021: 50 %).\nThe annual average number of employees at AIXTRON SE rose from 477 in the previous\nyear to 542 in the fiscal year 2022. As result of the increased number of employees and\nvariable remuneration components, personnel expenses increased from EUR 52.7 million\nin the previous year to EUR 65.3 million in fiscal year 2022.\nDespite the increase in capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization decreased by\nEUR 1.1 million from EUR 7.6 million in 2021 to EUR 6.5 million in 2022. This is mainly due\nto the fact that significant investments are recorded as assets under construction and\ntherefore no depreciation is incurred yet.\n89\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOther operating expenses were higher at EUR 88.6 million compared to EUR 61.0 million\nin fiscal year 2021. The main drivers were higher variable expenses for shipped systems.\nlosses from currency translation and increased development costs.\nIn comparison to 2021, other operating income increased from EUR 12.9 million to EUR\n15.2 million in the 2022 fiscal year. This is mainly due to income from foreign currency\ntranslation and exchange rate gains.\nIn addition, a result from investments of EUR 5.3 million (2021: EUR 4.3 million) was\ngenerated in fiscal year 2022. The result from investments in the fiscal year consists\nexclusively of dividend payments from subsidiaries. The previous year´s result includes\ndividend income from subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 8.3 million as well as an\nimpairment loss on the investment in APEVA Holdings Ltd. in the amount of EUR 4.0\nmillion.\nNet interest income totaled EUR -1.0 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to EUR -0.9\nmillion in 2021. This is mainly attributable to expenses from the fair value accounting of\nfund investments.\nNet Result AIXTRON SE – Use of Result\nThe net result of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 84.6 million. An amount of EUR 42.3\nmillion was transferred to retained earnings. Combined with the carried forward profit\nfrom the previous year in the amount of EUR 50.9 million and the dividend payment in\nMay 2022 in the amount of EUR 33.7 million, this results in a new accumulated profit of\nEUR 59.5 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 50.9 million). The\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that a\ndividend of EUR 0.31 per dividend-entitled share (2021: EUR 0.30) be paid for 2022.\nAssets and Liabilities and Financial Position of AIXTRON SE\nAt EUR 757.8 million, total assets at AIXTRON SE at the end of 2022 were about 23%\nhigher than the previous year’s figure (2021: EUR 615.6 million). This was due in particular\nto advance payments received from customers and the positive net result for the year.\n90\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBalance Sheet of AIXTRON SE (HGB)\nin EUR million 31.12.2022 31.12.2021\nAssets\nIntangible assets 3.3 2.2\nProperty, plant and equipment 85.7 63.8\nFinancial assets 46.9 46.4\nNon-current assets 135.9 112.4\nInventories 204.7 104.7\nTrade receivables 83.6 66.1\nReceivables from associates 36.1 15.8\nOther assets 10.5 6.6\nSecurities 220.3 141.6\nCash and credit balances at banks 65.7 167.7\nCurrent assets 620.9 502.5\nDeferred expenses and accrued income 1.0 0.7\nTotal assets 757.8 615.6\nin EUR million 31.12.2022 31.12.2021\nEquity and liabilities\nSubscribed capital 113.3 113.3\nTreasury stock -1.0 -1.1\nIssued capital 112.4 112.2\nCapital reserve 287.0 280.8\nRetained earnings 87.2 44.8\nAccumulated deficit 59.5 50.9\nEquity 546.1 488.7\nProvisions 47.7 46.1\nPrepayments received on order 120.3 62.0\nTrade payables 29.1 12.9\nLiabilities from associates 11.9 2.9\nOther liabilities 2.7 3.1\nLiabilities 164.0 80.8\nTotal equity and liabilities 757.8 615.6\n91\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from EUR 63.8 million in 2021 to EUR 85.7\nmillion in fiscal year 2022 due to increased capital expenditures, mainly for laboratory\nplant and equipment.\nFinancial assets increased to EUR 46.9 million (2021: EUR 46.4 million) due to the opening\nof a new subsidiary in Malaysia.\nThe increase in inventories from EUR 104.7 million as of December 31, 2021 to EUR 204.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 mainly reflects the high expected sale of systems in the\nfollowing quarters and the high order backlog.\nTrade receivables increased from EUR 66.1 million to EUR 83.6 million due to a high\nnumber of deliveries at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\nLiabilities\nThe subscribed capital of AIXTRON SE was at EUR 113.3 million as of December 31, 2022\n(December 31, 2021: EUR 113.3 million). Issued capital was EUR 112.4 million (2021: EUR\n112.2 million). A total of 56,400 shares were issued as part of stock option programs in\nthe fiscal year 2022.\nAs a result of the exercise of the stock options as well as the recognition of share-based\npayments expenses, the capital reserve increased from EUR 280.8 million as of December\n31, 2021, to EUR 287.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Due to the higher balance sheet\ntotal, the equity ratio decreased to 72% in the fiscal year compared to 79% in the\nprevious year, despite the increased total equity.\nTo secure prepayments received on orders, AIXTRON SE had guarantee facilities of EUR\n97.5 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: EUR 57.5 million), of which EUR 47.3 million\nhad been utilized as of the balance sheet date (2021: EUR 23.9 million).\nTrade payables increased to EUR 29.1 million due to reporting date factors and a higher\nprocurement volume (2021: EUR 12.9 million).\nAs of December 31, 2022, AIXTRON did not have any bank borrowings, as was the case on\nthe prior-year balance sheet dates.\nInvestments\nAlong with AIXTRON’s growth, capital expenditures in property, plant, equipment, other\nintangible assets and financial assets at AIXTRON SE totaled EUR 30.0 million in fiscal year\n2022 (2021: EUR 12.2 million).\nThereof EUR 27.2 million in 2022 were for property, plant and equipment (2021: EUR 10.9\nmillion). As in the previous year, this capital expenditure was mainly for laboratory\nequipment, test and demonstration equipment and expansion of production areas.\nFurthermore, AIXTRON SE invested EUR 2.3 million in intangible assets for licenses and\nsoftware (2021: EUR 1.1 million).\n92\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInvestments of EUR 0.5 million (2021: EUR 0.3 million) were made in financial assets in\nfiscal year 2022.

Adjusted for this effect, liquidity would have decreased by EUR 23.3 million.\nCash flow from operating activities decreased from EUR 61.3 million in 2021 to EUR 34.1\nmillion in the fiscal year 2022 mainly as a result of the the high level of receivables and\nincreased inventories as of the reporting date, which has not yet been fully reflected in\ncash flow.\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR -104.4 million in fiscal year 2022\n(2021: EUR -86.5 million) mainly due to additional investments in fund assets of EUR -78.7\nmillion (2021: EUR -79.2 million) and in property, plant and equipment of EUR 13.7\nmillion.\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -31.7 million in fiscal year 2022\n(2021: EUR -7.9 million). The main driver of this development was the dividend payment\nof EUR -31.7 million (2021: EUR -12.3 million).\nThere are no restrictions on access to the Company's cash and cash equivalents.\nOpportunities and Risks\nThe business development of AIXTRON SE is subject to substantially the same risks and\nopportunities as the AIXTRON Group. AIXTRON SE generally participates in the risks of its\nsubsidiaries in proportion to its respective ownership interest. As a result of the\ncentralized financial management of the AIXTRON Group, all financing transactions are\nconducted through AIXTRON SE. As the parent company of the AIXTRON Group, AIXTRON\nSE is integrated into the Group-wide risk management system. For further information,\nplease refer to the Opportunities and Risks Report.\n93\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nThe outlook for the AIXTRON Group largely reflects the expectations of AIXTRON SE. The\nearnings development of AIXTRON SE should continue to be in line with that of the Group\nin the future, as the results of the subsidiaries are reflected in the income from\ninvestments of the Group’s parent company. Management by means of performance\nindicators is carried out exclusively at Group level. The comments on the expected results\nof operations and financial position therefore also apply to AIXTRON SE (see in the\nfollowing section “Expected Developments”).\n94\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Expected Developments,\nOpportunities and Risks\nExpected Developments\nFuture Market Environment\nIn its \"World Economic Outlook Update\" (January 2023), the IMF forecasts global\neconomic growth of 2.9% for 2023. Central bank interest rate hikes to combat inflation\nand Russia's war in Ukraine continue to weigh on economic activity. The rapid spread of\nCOVID-19 in China dampened growth in 2022, but the recent opening-up has paved the\nway for a faster-than-expected recovery. Global inflation is expected to decline in 2023 to\n6.6% in 2023, still above pre-pandemic (2017-19) levels of around 3.5%. At this point in\ntime, AIXTRON does not expect the general global economic environment to have any\nsignificant impact on business development. The industry and sector-specific conditions\nfor the demand for AIXTRON systems are still intact, although an impact from negative\nmacroeconomic developments cannot be ruled out.\nMarket observers see the development of production systems in the semiconductor\nindustry as positive in the coming years. According to a study by the leading global\nindustry association SEMI from December 2022, the overall market for investments in so-\ncalled wafer fab systems, which also include AIXTRON's deposition systems, will grow\nfrom an all-time high of around USD 95 billion in 2022 to around Contract USD 79 billion\nin 2023, to increase again to c. USD 92 billion in 2024. A large part of the market is still in\nKorea, Taiwan and China. According to SEMI, the market for wafer fab equipment is\ncurrently burdened by difficult macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the\nsemiconductor industry. However, emerging applications in numerous markets are\nexpected to ensure significant growth in the semiconductor industry again this decade,\nwhich should necessitate further investments to expand production capacities.\nRegardless of the market development of the entire semiconductor industry, the market\nsegments on which AIXTRON focuses are determined by megatrends, the development of\nwhich will be decisive for the future development and size of AIXTRON's markets.\nThe sale of GaN power semiconductors is largely driven by the need to increase energy\nefficiency in the global IT infrastructure and in data centers in order to slow down the\nrapid increase in energy consumption. The electric mobility of the future is expected to\nlead to an increased use of SiC components in the drive train and in the charging\ninfrastructure in order to be able to better meet the requirements for range and\nefficiency.\nThe increasing demand for lasers manufactured on AIXTRON systems is due to the rapidly\ngrowing need for fast and energy-efficient optical data communication (cloud computing,\nvideo streaming, etc.). Likewise, 3D sensor technology in consumer electronics\n(smartphone, TV) and in the areas of access control, as well as the progress of industrial\ndigitization and a growing number of vehicles that use 3D sensor technology, contribute\nto an increased demand for lasers.\n95\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinally, additional new markets for AIXTRON are determined by the spread of new types\nof displays in smartwatches, TVs, smartphones and notebooks: Micro LED displays, whose\nself-luminous LED pixels can be produced on AIXTRON's MOCVD systems, are aimed at\nreplacing today's LCD or OLED display technology through innovative, energy-saving\nalternatives with better luminosity, contrast, color fidelity and resolution. Commercial\ndissemination of these innovative display technologies will significantly determine the\nsize of these additional new sales markets for AIXTRON.\nExpected Financial and Earnings Position\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, the Group again expects revenue growth compared to the\nprevious year. Customer demand continues to span all areas of technology. The Executive\nBoard is optimistic about both the short- and long-term positive prospects, both for the\ndemand for MOCVD systems for the production of lasers, in particular for optical data\ntransmission, as well as for Micro LED-based display applications and GaN power devices.\nWith regard to the demand for systems for the production of SiC power components, the\nExecutive Board expects an increasing contribution to revenues in the 2023 fiscal year\ncompared to 2022.\nBased on the current group structure, an estimate of the order situation and the budget\nexchange rate of 1.15 USD/EUR (2022: 1.20 USD/EUR), the Executive Board expects for\nthe 2023 fiscal year order intake on group level in a range between EUR 600 million and\nEUR 680 million With revenues in a range between EUR 580 million and EUR 640 million,\nthe Executive Board expects to achieve a gross margin of around 45% and an EBIT margin\nof around 25% - 27% in the 2023 fiscal year.\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board assumes that AIXTRON will not need any\nexternal bank financing in the 2023 fiscal year either. In addition, it is assumed that the\nGroup will be able to maintain a solid equity base for the foreseeable future.\nOverall Statement on the Future Development\nAIXTRON's systems enable the production of power semiconductors for highly efficient\nenergy conversion in the area of power supply for data centers or consumer electronics\nor electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure (GaN and SiC components). Lasers\nmanufactured with the help of AIXTRON systems are key components in fast optical data\ntransmission (cloud computing, Internet of Things), in 3D sensors and increasingly in\ncomplex vehicle assistance systems. AIXTRON technology also enables the production of\nhigh-frequency chips for 5G mobile networks and key components for the production of\nthe latest generation of displays (fine pitch displays, mini and micro LED displays).\nDue to AIXTRON's proven ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative\ndeposition systems in a flexible number for several customer markets, the Executive\nBoard is convinced of the positive future prospects for the group and its target markets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, AIXTRON did not have any legally binding agreements on\nfinancial investments or the acquisition or sale of parts of the company.\n96\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisk Report\nRisk Management System\nAIXTRON's risk management system is controlled centrally and includes all of AIXTRON's\nkey organizational units in the process. The Corporate Governance & Compliance\ndepartment, headed by the responsible CFO of AIXTRON SE, is responsible for setting up a\nrisk management system and informs the entire Executive Board and the Supervisory\nBoard of AIXTRON SE at regular intervals or ad hoc if necessary.\nThe primary goals of the risk management system support the achievement of strategic\nbusiness goals and early detection of potential risks compared to the applicable corporate\nplanning that could negatively affect the achievement of strategic business goals and\nbusiness activities. The risk management system supports the Executive Board in the\nsystematic, effective and efficient management of identified risks by defining, prioritizing\nand tracking risk-reducing measures. In order to meet the extended requirements of IDW\nPS 340, the conformity and meaningfulness of AIXTRON's risk management system were\nexamined and essential instruments were further optimized in terms of presentation and\nmeaningfulness. The subject of this consideration was the further development of the\nframework specifications for the risk management system, the risk assessment scheme,\nthe risk-bearing capacity and the resulting overall risk position in the AIXTRON Group. The\nresults and resulting adjustments were integrated into the risk management process and\nrisk reporting, used in the quarterly risk inventory and documented in the Group-wide risk\nmanagement system manual. In order to further optimize the risk management system,\nnew software for the risk management system was introduced in the fourth quarter of\n2022.\nAll members of the senior management team and other key employees have been trained\nin the use of the new risk management software.\nThe regular, quarterly risk inventory is initiated, carried out and monitored by the central\nrisk manager. All risk managers from the operational and administrative areas, all general\nmanagers of the AIXTRON subsidiaries and the Executive Board are asked about the\ncurrent developments in already documented risks and measures to reduce them, as well\nas possible new risks. The results are collated at central level and discussed in a risk\ncommittee before the Supervisory Board is informed.\nAIXTRON uses risk management software to support the risk management process. All\nrisk owners have access to the software. This ensures that abrupt changes in the risk\nsituation or newly identified risks are reported by the risk managers and integrated into\nthe risk portfolio and reported promptly.\nAt AIXTRON, all individual risks and risk aggregates are evaluated and classified according\nto a defined scheme. The assessment of the probability of occurrence can be specified in\nfour levels or as a fixed value. The possible extent of damage if the risk occurs can also be\nrecorded in four stages or as a three-point analysis. The amount of damage relates to the\nimpact on the operating result (EBIT) of the AIXTRON Group. If the risk is significant for\nrelevant risks, a possible outflow of cash is also used as the amount of damage.\n97\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe four levels for the probability of occurrence of the risks, in addition to the possibility\nof a fixed value, are divided into:\n• Very unlikely = <5%\n• Unlikely = 5% – 10%\n• Likely = >10% – 50%\n• Very likely = > 50% – 100%\nThe potential net loss (measured as a percentage of equity) is used as a criterion for\nevaluating the possible financial impact of a risk on the earnings (EBIT) of the AIXTRON\nGroup. The four possible levels in addition to the three-point view were calculated as\nfollows:\n• Negligible = <0,4%\n• Moderate = 0,4% – 2%\n• Significant = > 2% – 4%\n• Severe = > 4%\nThe risk effects are presented both in terms of possible gross/net effects and in different\nobservation periods (up to 12 months, 13 – 24 months and longer than 24 months). The\ngross loss represents the loss potential in the event of a risk occurring without taking into\naccount other effects such as risk reduction measures. The net loss describes the loss\npotential in the event of a risk occurring taking into account the effects resulting from the\nrisk reduction measures such as insurance, provisions, budget- and forecast recording of\nrisks. A risk matrix is derived from this assessment, which divides the risks of the AIXTRON\nGroup into the following four risk classes (see chart for color scale):\n• Acceptable risk (green)\n• Moderate risk (yellow)\n• Significant risk (orange)\n• Substantial risk (red)\nThe risks classified as substantial are the main risks in relation to a threat to the continued\nexistence of the AIXTRON Group within the meaning of the German Accounting Standard\n(DRS 20).\n98\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisk Map\nInternal Control System (ICS)\nThe internal control system (ICS) is part of the corporate governance organization. The\naim of the ICS is to ensure that business activities are carried out properly, that financial\nreporting is reliable and that legal, regulatory and internal requirements are met. To\nachieve this goal, potential operational, financial and compliance risks are identified,\nassessed and internal controls implemented when deemed necessary. The effectiveness\nof the control measures is checked at regular intervals by the Corporate Governance and\nCompliance department. To ensure functional and disciplinary independence, the ICS\nreports to the Chief Compliance Officer. The ICS has no direct operational responsibility\nand/or authority for the processes within the ICS.\nInternal Control System (ICS) in the Accounting Process\nThe internal control system in the accounting process of the AIXTRON Group includes\nboth the accounting process of AIXTRON SE and the group accounting process. It defines\ncontrols and monitoring activities, which are measures aimed at ensuring the proper\nhandling of business activities, reliable financial reporting and compliance with laws and\nguidelines. A control system that is appropriate for the size of the group and business\nactivities is the prerequisite for effectively controlling operational, financial and other\nrisks.\nIn the accounting process, controls are defined at risk points that help ensure that the\nannual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in\naccordance with the regulations. A separation of functions that is adequate for the size of\nthe group and the application of the four-eyes principle reduce the risk of fraudulent\nactivities.\nA global IT system is used to prepare the annual financial statements, the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the consolidation, which ensures a uniform and consistent\napproach and data security. Central system backups are regularly carried out for the\nrelevant IT systems in order to avoid data loss. In addition, defined authorizations and\naccess restrictions are part of the security concept.\n99\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe corporate function Finance of the AIXTRON Group is technically and organizationally\nresponsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements and the consolidated\nfinancial statements. In the decentralized units, local employees are responsible for\npreparing the local financial statements. Uniform group accounting is ensured by group-\nwide specifications in terms of content and deadlines, as well as accounting guidelines\nand valuation principles. The Compliance department regularly checks compliance and\neffectiveness of the controls and is therefore involved in the overall process.\nIn the opinion of the Executive Board, these coordinated processes, systems and controls\nensure that the Group accounting process is in accordance with IFRS and the annual\nfinancial statements are in accordance with HGB and other accounting-related regulations\nand laws and are reliable.\nInternal Audit\nThe internal audit is part of the corporate governance organization and is set up by the\naudit committee of AIXTRON SE on behalf of the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE.\nInternal Auditing reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Executive Board.\nInternal Audit's annual plan is discussed with and approved by the Audit Committee and\nthe Board of Directors. Internal Audit aims to provide independent and objective auditing\nand consulting services to improve the organization and add value. Internal Audit follows\na systematic and disciplined approach to assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of\norganizational processes and tools. The follow-up to internal audit findings and progress\nis regularly discussed with the Audit Committee and the Board.\nIn addition, the annual internal audit plans are prepared on the basis of a risk-based\nmethodology, which takes into account findings and risks in the area of compliance risk\nmanagement and the internal control systems. Based on the risks and findings, a\nrecommendation for the annual internal audit plan is submitted to the Audit Committee\nfor review and approval. In addition, the findings and risks are reviewed on an ongoing\nbasis and, if necessary, ad hoc reviews are recommended to the Audit Committee.\nOverall Statement on the Effectiveness of the Risk Management and Internal\nControl System\nThe design of the risk management and internal control system described is based on the\nlegal framework and international standards – such as the German Stock Corporation Act,\nthe German Corporate Governance Code or the auditing standard \"IDW PS 340 n.F.\"\nissued by the Institute of Public Auditors. Based on the information made available to the\nExecutive Board of AIXTRON SE, it is not aware of any circumstances that could impair the\nappropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system (RMS) or the internal\ncontrol system (ICS).1\n1 The information in this paragraph (overall statement on the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control\nsystem) was made in accordance with the new requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code 2022. They are to\nbe classified as \"not related to the management report\" because they go beyond the legal requirements and are therefore\nnot part of the substantive audit by the auditor.\n100\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisks Factors\nThe following risks could possibly have a significant negative impact on AIXTRON's results\nof operations, net assets and financial position, net assets, liquidity and the stock market\nprice of the shares as well as on the actual outcome of matters to which the forward-\nlooking statements contained in this combined management report are based relate. The\nrisks explained below are not the only ones faced by the AIXTRON Group. There may be\nother risks that AIXTRON is currently unaware of, as well as general corporate risks such\nas political risks, the risk of force majeure and other unforeseeable events. In addition,\nthere may be risks that AIXTRON currently considers immaterial, but which ultimately\ncould also have a material negative impact on the AIXTRON Group. Please refer to the\n“Forward-Looking Statements” section for more information on forward-looking\nstatements.\nIn terms of the German Accounting Standard (DRS 20), the following risks were\nconsidered material as of December 31, 2022:\nMarket and Competition-Related Risks\nAIXTRON's target markets are distributed worldwide, with a regional focus on Asia,\nEurope and the USA. AIXTRON is therefore subject to global economic cycles and\ngeopolitical risks such as the trade conflict between the USA and China, which could\nadversely affect the business of the AIXTRON Group. Such risks cannot be influenced by\nAIXTRON.\nThe markets addressed by AIXTRON are cyclical and can therefore be volatile. The timing,\nlength and intensity of these industry cycles are difficult to predict and influence through\nAIXTRON. In order to spread market-related risks, AIXTRON therefore diversifies and\noffers products in different target markets.\nIn each of these markets, AIXTRON is in competition with other companies. It is possible\nthat new competitors will appear on the market or that established competitors will\nadopt strategies or launch products that may negatively impact market expectations\noverall or of individual key customers of AIXTRON.\nMarket developments are continuously observed and assessed by AIXTRON. In order to\nreduce the risk of dependence on individual markets and their fluctuations, AIXTRON has\nimplemented a management system designed to ensure that market developments are\nidentified early and used optimally.\nAIXTRON's market and competition risks are classified as significant risks, since the extent\nof damage in the event of a risk occurring would have a significant impact on the Group's\nhigh revenue and profit expectations in the medium to long term.\nTechnological Risks\nSome of the technologies that AIXTRON offers enable new, disruptive application options.\nThis often means long development and qualification cycles for AIXTRON products, since\ndemanding technical and/or other customer specifications have to be met (sometimes for\nthe first time) before a business deal is concluded.\n101\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDue to the predominantly long development and qualification cycles of AIXTRON's\nproducts, there is a possibility that AIXTRON's technologies and products are developed\nfor markets or application areas in which the framework conditions of the end markets or\nthe strategic planning of potential customers change fundamentally in the course of the\ndevelopment cycle.\nThe ongoing focus on research and development activities in the past fiscal year and the\nintensive involvement of external technology partners are still considered by AIXTRON\nSE’s Executive Board to be suitable measures to reduce this risk.\nAIXTRON's technology risks are classified as significant risks, since the extent of damage in\nthe event of a risk occurring would have a significant impact on the Group's high revenues\nand profit expectations in both medium and longer term.\nIf it turns out that a technology risk has materialized and the introduction of a new\ntechnology cannot be implemented as planned, this can result in the planned and\nforecasted revenues being exposed to the risk of being postponed or omitted, and thus\ndevelopment activities being refinanced later than planned or not not at all.\nIn AIXTRON's risk management system, the following risks are not considered significant\nfor the Group:\n• Currency and Financial Risks\n• Production and related risks\n• Legal Risks\n• Risks related to patents and intellectual property\n• COVID-19 Pandemic\nAIXTRON defines IT and information security risks as breaches of integrity, confidentiality\nand liability.\nThe Group has invested in extensive technical and organizational measures to increase\ninformation security and protect information from unauthorized access, unwanted\nmodification or deletion. The information security measures taken are subject to regular\nmonitoring and continuous improvement and are supported by targeted awareness and\ntraining concepts. Accordingly, the overall risk classification could be reduced.\nAs part of the risk management system, the effects, measures and prospects in relation to\nthe current COVID-19 pandemic situation and possible resulting effects on global material\navailability and supply chains are recorded, discussed, evaluated and reported in our\nregular quarterly risk inventory.\nOverall Statement on the Risk Situation of AIXTRON SE\nCompared to the 2021 fiscal year, the overall risk situation remains unchanged for the\n2022 fiscal year, with the exception of the changes described above in the AIXTRON\nGroup. The further focusing of research and development activities with a focus on the\nrenewal and expansion of the product portfolio tightens the risk portfolio and thus\nimproves the use of opportunities and the avoidance of risks in AIXTRON's target markets.\n102\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nNeither in the 2022 fiscal year nor at the time of writing of this management report has\nthe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE identified any risks for the company that could\nthreaten its continued existence as of December 31, 2022.\nOpportunities Report\nAIXTRON's core competence is the development of the latest technologies for the precise\ndeposition of complex semiconductor structures and other functional materials. Here the\ngroup has developed a leading competitive position worldwide. In order to maintain or\nexpand these positions, AIXTRON continuously invests in corresponding research and\ndevelopment projects, e.g. for MOCVD systems for the production of semiconductors for\napplications such as micro LEDs, lasers or power electronics. The Executive Board will\nmaintain the focus on AIXTRON's core competence in order to successfully work on\nexisting as well as to successfully open up new markets.\nImportant market segments for power electronics based on wide-band gap materials such\nas gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are the automotive industry, energy\nindustry, telecommunications and consumer electronics. The development of energy-\nefficient solutions for AC/DC converters and inverters as well as high-frequency power\namplifiers is becoming increasingly important. The trend towards the electrification of\nvehicles and their charging infrastructure using SiC-based components plays an important\nrole here. GaN-based components, e.g. for fast charging of mobile devices, are becoming\nincreasingly popular. The demand for energy-saving GaN-based power supply in IT, such\nas data centers or servers, is currently increasing rapidly and is expected to continue to\nincrease over the coming years through the development of additional market segments.\nGaAs or GaN-based high-frequency components, which are used for signal transmission in\n5G networks or for the WLAN 6 standard, also make a contribution to revenues.\nImportant market segments in optoelectronics are consumer electronics, data\ncommunication and display technology. The trend towards optical data transmission over\nshorter distances, e.g. in data centers or when connecting households to a fiber optic\nnetwork, as well as the worldwide expansion of fiber optic networks for fast data\ntransmission, is causing increasing demand for systems for the production of edge and\nsurface emitting lasers (EEL and VCSEL). AIXTRON expects demand to increase over the\ncoming years, especially when demand for 3D sensors increases due to virtual reality\napplications or LiDAR in the automotive sector. Demand for equipment manufacturing\nred, amber and yellow (ROY) LEDs is currently subdued, also impacted by weaker\nconsumer demand. Further growth potential lies in the increasing commercialization of\nmicro LED displays, which would be accompanied by additional significant demand for\nsystems for these demanding applications. These display technologies have high potential\nin various consumer electronics end-use applications.\nAIXTRON expects that the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end-\nuser markets can have a positive impact on further business development:\nShort Term:\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN or SiC-based components for energy-efficient\npower electronics in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, mobile devices and IT\ninfrastructure\n103\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• Increasing use of GaN-based components in the field of 5G network infrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based components in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for\n5G mobile communications or WLAN 6 technology\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for high-volume optical data transmission, e.g.\nfor video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing use of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensing in mobile\ndevices and in infrastructure applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and special LEDs (especially red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) in\ndisplay and other applications\n• Increasing commercialization of Micro LED displays\nMedium to Long Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated energy\nmanagement\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visible light communication\ntechnology\n• Increasing application of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for\nautonomous driving\n• Use of GaN-based components in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for the\nmillimeter wave range of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Increased development activities for high-performance solar cells made from\ncompound semiconductors\nOverall Picture of Opportunities\nAs part of the assessment of our business opportunities, investment opportunities or\ndevelopment projects are reviewed and prioritized in terms of their potential value\nproposition to ensure an effective allocation of resources. We focus specifically on growth\nmarkets that are positively influenced by global megatrends such as increasing\nelectromobility, electrification, energy efficiency, digitization and networking, in order to\nmake the best possible use of the opportunities that arise for the Group's ecologically and\neconomically sustainable business development.\nIf identified opportunities are deemed likely to materialize, they are incorporated into\nbusiness plans and short-term forecasts. Trends or events going beyond this, which could\nlead to a positive development for the net assets, financial position and results of\noperations, are observed and can have a positive effect on our medium to long-term\nprospects.\n104\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLegal Disclosures\nGroup Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f\nin conjunction with Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB)\nThe Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f HGB has been\ncombined with the Group Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 315d\nHGB. This combined declaration including a Corporate Governance Report is available on\nthe homepage of AIXTRON SE at Declaration of Corporate Governance\n(www.aixtron.com/investoren/corporate-governance/en/corporate-governance-\nstatement/2022_Declaration_Corporate-Governance_EN.pdf) and is part of this annual\nreport.1\nInformation Concerning Section 289a in conjunction with Section\n315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) on Takeovers\nThe share capital of AIXTRON SE as of December 31, 2022, amounted to EUR 113,348,420\n(December 31, 2021: EUR 113,292,020) divided into EUR 113,348,420 registered shares\nwith a proportional interest in the share capital of EUR 1.00 per no-par value registered\nshare. Each no-par value share represents the proportionate share in AIXTRON’s stated\nshare capital and carries one vote at the Company’s annual shareholders’ meeting. All\nregistered shares are fully paid in.\nAs of December 31, 2022, AIXTRON SE held 965,224 treasury shares, which accounted for\na share capital in the amount of EUR 965,224 (2021: 1,084,105). The treasury shares\ncorrespond to 1% of the share capital (previous year: 1%).\nAIXTRON SE has issued a share certificate representing multiples of shares (global share).\nShareholders do not have the right to the issue of a share certificate representing their\nshare(s).

Such components are used in\nfiber optic communication systems, wireless and mobile telephony applications, optical\nand electronic storage devices, computing, signaling, and lighting, displays, as well as a\nrange of other leading-edge technologies.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Executive Board and\nhave been submitted to the Supervisory Board at its meeting held on February 27, 2023\nfor approval and publication.\n114\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n(A) Companies Included in Consolidation\nCompanies included in consolidation are AIXTRON SE, and companies controlled by\nAIXTRON SE. The balance sheet date of all consolidated companies is December 31. A list\nof all consolidated companies is shown in note 32.\n(B) Basis of Accounting\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR). The amounts are\nrounded to the nearest thousand Euro (EUR thousand).\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the\nrevaluation of certain financial instruments.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, as they are to be applied\nin the EU, requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of income and expenses\nduring the reported period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates and judgements are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if\nthis revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if\nthe revision affects both current and future periods. Estimates and judgments which have\na significant effect on the Group’s financial statements are described in note 37.\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods\npresented in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently by each consolidated company.\n(C) Bases of Consolidation\n(I) Subsidiaries\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the\nCompany and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31\nDecember each year. Control is achieved when the Company:\n• has the power over the investee;\n• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;\nand\n• has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.\n115\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances\nindicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed\nabove.\nEntities over which AIXTRON SE has control are treated as subsidiaries (see note 32). The\nresults of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date\nthat control commences until the date that control ceases.\n(II) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation\nAll intercompany income and expenses, transactions and balances have been eliminated\nin the consolidation.\n(D) Foreign Currency\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro (EUR). In the\ntranslation of financial statements of subsidiaries outside the Euro-Zone the local\ncurrencies are also the functional currencies of those companies. Assets and liabilities of\nthose companies are translated to EUR at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.\nIncome and expenses are translated to EUR at average exchange rates for the year or at\naverage exchange rates for the period between their inclusion in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the balance sheet date. Net equity is translated at historical\nrates. The differences arising on translation are disclosed in the consolidated statement\nof changes in equity.\nExchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates in the case of\nforeign currency transactions are recognized in the income statement in „other operating\nincome“ or „other operating expenses“.\n(E) Property, Plant and Equipment\n(I) Acquisition or Manufacturing Cost\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, plus ancillary charges such as\ninstallation and delivery costs, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment\nlosses (see accounting policy (J)).\nCosts of internally generated assets include not only costs of material and personnel, but\nalso a share of directly attributable overhead costs, such as employee benefits, delivery\ncosts, installation, and professional fees.\nWhere parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they\nare depreciated as separate items of property, plant and equipment.\n(II) Subsequent Recognition of Costs\nAIXTRON recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment\nthe cost of replacing components or enhancement of such an item when that cost is\nincurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied in the item will flow\nto the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs such as\nrepairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n116\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(III) Government Grants\nGovernment grants related to the acquisition or manufacture of owned assets are\ndeducted from original cost at the date of capitalization.\n(IV) Depreciation\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each\npart of an item of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives, depreciation method and\nresidual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the year-end date or\nmore frequently if circumstances arise which are indicative of a change. The estimated\nuseful lives are as follows:\n• Buildings 25 - 45 years\n• Machinery and equipment 3 - 19 years\n• Other plant, factory and office equipment 2 - 20 years\nThe useful lives of leased assets do not exceed the expected lease periods.\n(V) Leased Assets\nThe Group only has contracts in which it is the lessee.\nAIXTRON assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of the contract.\nThe Group recognizes a lease asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all\nlease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as\nleases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as\ntablets and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these\nleases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-\nline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more\nrepresentative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are\nconsumed.\nAIXTRON recognizes a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.\nThe leased asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the\nlease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement\ndate, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and\nremove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is\nlocated, less any lease incentives received.\nThe leased asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the\ncommencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the\nexpected end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of leased assets are\ndetermined on the same bases as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition,\nthe leased asset is periodically tested and reduced by impairment losses, if any, and\nadjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment, and leased assets\nin the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are\nnot paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the\n117\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company’s incremental borrowing\nrate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed\npayments, less any lease incentives and variable lease payments that depend on an index\nor rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date.\nThe lease liabilities are included in other non-current payables and other current liabilities\nin the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in\nindex or rate, or if the company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a\npurchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this\nway, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the leased asset, or is\nrecorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the leased asset has been reduced to\nzero.\nThe Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.\n(F) Intangible Assets\n(I) Goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is allocated to\ncash-generating units and is tested at least once per year for impairment (see accounting\npolicy (J)).\n(II) Research and Development\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical\nknowledge and understanding using scientific methods, is recognized as an expense as\nincurred.\nExpenditure on development comprises costs incurred with the purpose of using scientific\nknowledge technically and commercially. As not all criteria of IAS 38 are met AIXTRON\ndoes not capitalize such costs.\n(III) Other Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortization\n(see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (J)).\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are stated at their fair value at\nthe date of purchase.\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and patents is expensed as\nincurred.\n118\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IV) Subsequent Expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure on capitalized intangible assets is capitalized only when it\nincreases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.\nAll other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n(V) Amortization\nAmortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of\nintangible assets, except for goodwill. Goodwill has a useful life which is indefinite and is\ntested annually in respect of its recoverable amount. Other intangible assets are\namortized from the date they are available for use. Useful lives and residual values of\nintangible assets are reviewed at the year-end date or more frequently if circumstances\narise which are indicative of a change.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n• Software 2 - 5 years\n• Patents and similar rights 4 - 18 years\n• Customer base and product and technology know how 6 - 10 years\n(G) Financial Instruments\n(I) Financial Assets\nFinancial assets are classified into the following specific categories:\n• financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL),\n• ‘at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), and\n• ‘at amortized cost’.\nThe classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is\ndetermined at the time of initial recognition.\n(II) Financial Assets at FVTOCI\nAIXTRON did not have any financial assets in this category during the periods covered by\nthis report.\n(III) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost as they are held within a business model\nto collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(IV) Financial Assets at FVTPL\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI under IFRS 9\nare measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).\n119\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period,\nwith any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss including\ndividends earned on financial asset and is included in profit and loss account and in note 5\nor 6 respectively. Fair value is determined in accordance with IFRS 13.\n(V) Trade Receivables\nTrade receivables and other receivables are measured at amortized cost as they are held\nwithin a business model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist\nsolely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(VI) Impairment of Financial Assets\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on trade\nreceivables and contract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each\nreporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective\nfinancial instrument. The Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables, and\ncontract assets. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a\nprovision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for\nfactors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment\nof both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date,\nincluding time value of money where appropriate.\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECL when there has\nbeen a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk\non the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the\nGroup measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to\n12-month ECL. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all\npossible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-\nmonth ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default\nevents on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting\ndate.\n(VII) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with banks with a\nmaturity of less than three months at inception.\n(VIII) Equity Instruments\nEquity instruments, including share capital, issued by the Group are recorded at the\nproceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n(IX) Financial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities “at FVTPL” or \"at amortized\ncost\".\n(X) Financial Liabilities at FVTPL\nAIXTRON did not have any financial liabilities in this category during the periods covered\nby this report.\n120\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(XI) Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost\nOther financial liabilities, including trade payables, are measured at amortized cost.\n(XII) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange\ncurrency rates (see note 25). AIXTRON may use foreign exchange forward contracts to\nhedge these exposures. AIXTRON does not use derivative financial instruments for\nspeculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by\nthe Executive Board, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.\nAIXTRON did not have any derivative financial instruments in the periods covered by this\nreport.\n(H) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is\nthe estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of\ncompletion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using weighted average cost.\nThe cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to\ntheir existing location and condition. In the case of work in progress and finished goods,\ncost includes direct material and production cost, as well as an appropriate share of\noverheads based on normal operating capacity. Scrap and other wasted costs are\nexpensed on a periodic basis either as cost of sales or, in the case of beta tools as\nresearch and development expense.\nAllowance for slow moving, excess and obsolete, and otherwise unsaleable inventory is\nrecorded based primarily on either the estimated forecast of product demand and\nproduction requirement or historical usage. When the estimated future demand is less\nthan the inventory, AIXTRON writes down such inventories.\n(I) Operating Result\nOperating result is stated before finance income, finance expense and tax.\n(J) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible\nAssets\nGoodwill purchased as part of a business acquisition is tested at least annually for\nimpairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment. For\nimpairment test purposes, the goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. Impairment\nlosses are recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair\nvalue less costs of disposal or value in use of the cash-generating unit. Details of\nimpairment test are shown in note 12.\nProperty, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets are tested for\nimpairment, where there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. The Group\nassesses at the end of each period whether there is an indication that an asset may be\n121\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nimpaired. Impairment losses on such assets are recognized, to the extent that the\ncarrying amount exceeds both the fair value that would be obtainable from a disposal in\nan arm’s length transaction, and the value in use.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present\nvalue using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks\nassociated with the asset.\nImpairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to\ndetermine the recoverable amount. Reversals are made only to the extent that the\ncarrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been\ndetermined if no impairment loss had been recognized.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n(K) Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted\naverage number of issued common shares for the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect\nthe potential dilution that could occur if options issued under the Company’s stock option\nplans were exercised unless such exercises had an anti-dilutive effect.\n(L) Employee Benefits\n(I) Defined Contribution Plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nexpense in the income statement as incurred.\n(II) Share-based Payment Transactions\nStock Option Programs\nThe stock option programs from 2007 and 2012 allow members of the Executive Board,\nmanagement, and employees of the Group to acquire shares of AIXTRON SE. The\ncontractual terms of these share programs are presented in note 22. These stock option\nprograms are accounted for according to IFRS 2 for equity-settled share-based payment\ntransactions. The fair value of options granted is recognized as personnel expense with a\ncorresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. The fair value is calculated at grant\ndate and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally\nentitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a\nmathematical model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the\noptions were granted. The vesting conditions relate to a service condition and a market\ncondition in relation to the share price of AIXTRON SE. In the calculation of the personnel\nexpense options forfeited during the performance period are taken into account.\nLong-term Incentive of the Board of Directors (LTI)\nExecutive Board remuneration system at AIXTRON SE consists long-term variable remune-\nration incentives (LTI) granted in shares of AIXTRON SE. These equity-settled share-based\npayments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair\n122\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nvalue of the shares granted is measured using a mathematical model, taking into account\nthe terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted. Further details regarding\nthe equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 22 and 31.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period, based on the Group’s\nestimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. For non-market-based\nvesting conditions, the Group reviews its estimate of number of equity instruments at\neach reporting date during vesting period. The impact of the revision of the original\nestimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss and a corresponding adjustment is\nrecognized to equity.\n(M) Provisions\nA provision is recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as\na result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be\nrequired to settle this obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by\ndiscounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current\nmarket assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks\nassociated with the liability.\n(I) Warranties\nThe Group normally offers one- or two-year warranties on all of its products. Warranty\nexpenses generally include cost of labor, material and related overhead necessary to\nrepair a product free of charge during the warranty period. The specific terms and\nconditions of those warranties may vary depending on the equipment sold, the terms of\nthe contract and the locations from which they are sold. The Group establishes the costs\nthat may be incurred under its warranty obligations and records a liability in the amount\nof such costs at the time revenue is recognized.\nFactors affecting the warranty obligation include the historical and expected number of\nwarranty claims and the estimated cost per warranty claim.\nThe Group accrues warranty cost for systems shipped based upon historical experience.\nThe Group periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty provisions and\nadjusts the amounts as necessary.\nExtended warranties, beyond the normal warranty periods, are treated as maintenance\nservices in accordance with note 2(N) below.\n(II) Onerous Contracts\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected economic benefits to\nbe derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting\nits obligations under the contract. The amount recognized as a provision is determined as\nthe excess of the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract over\nthe economic benefits expected to be received. Before making that provision any\nimpairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract are recognized.\nThe provision is discounted to present value if the adjustment is material.\n123\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(III) Restructuring\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal\nplan for the restructuring and the parties concerned have been informed. The\nmeasurement of restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising\nfrom the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the\nrestructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\n(N) Revenue\nAIXTRON enters contracts with customers for goods and services, including combinations\nof goods and services. Contracts are usually for fixed prices and do not offer any unilateral\nright of return to the customer.\nRevenue is generated from the following major sources:\n• sale of equipment\n• installation of equipment\n• sale and installation of customer specific equipment\n• spare parts\n• services\nRevenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation in contracts\nwith its customers by transferring control of promised goods or services to the customer\nand it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to\nthe entity.\nThe sale of equipment involves acceptance tests at AIXTRON ́s production facility. After\nsuccessful completion of this test, the equipment is dismantled and packaged for\nshipment.\nRevenues from the sale of products that have been demonstrated to meet product\nspecification requirements are recognized at a point in time upon shipment to the\ncustomer if full acceptance tests have been successfully completed at the AIXTRON\nproduction facility and control has passed to the customer and the customer can benefit\nfrom the product either on its own or with other resources that are readily available.\nUpon arrival at the customer site the equipment is reassembled and installed, which is a\nservice generally performed by AIXTRON engineers. Revenue relating to the installation of\nthe equipment is recognized at the point in time when AIXTRON has fulfilled its\nperformance obligations under the contract and control of the goods has passed to the\ncustomer.\nRevenue related to equipment where meeting the product specification requirements has\nnot yet been demonstrated or the customer cannot benefit from the product either on its\nown or with other resources that are readily available, or where specific rights of return\nhave been negotiated, is recognized only at the point in time when the customer finally\naccepts the equipment and has control.\n124\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue related to spares is recognized at the point in time at which the customer\nobtains control of the goods, generally at the point of delivery.\nRevenue related to services such as repair works is recognized at the point in time as the\ncustomers accepts the equipment at this point.\nRevenue for services such as extended warranty, is recognized over time during the\nperiod in which it is provided. No revenue was generated from extended warranty in the\nfiscal year.\nAs part of the payment terms, AIXTRON does not grant any general right of return, cash\ndiscount, credit notes or other sales incentives. Generally, payment terms for advance\npayments and customer invoices are short-term and contracts do not include a financing\ncomponent.\nThe consideration from contracts which include combinations of different performance\nobligations such as equipment, spares and services is allocated to each performance\nobligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer.\nDiscounts from list price are proportionately allocated to each performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on a relative\nstand-alone selling price basis. As the stand-alone selling prices are usually not directly\nobservable, AIXTRON uses the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the\nstand-alone selling price.\nThe portion of equipment revenue related to installation services is determined based on\neither the method described above or, if the Group determines that there may be a risk\nthat the economic benefits of installation services may not flow to the Group, the portion\nof the contract amount that is due and payable upon completion of the installation.\nContract assets may arise for contracts with different performance obligations if the\nrevenue recognized exceed the amounts for received advance payments and customer\ninvoices (see note 16).\n(O) Expenses\n(I) Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes such direct costs as materials, labor, and related production\noverheads.\n(II) Research and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of beta tools which do\nnot qualify to be recognized as an asset are expensed as research and development costs.\nProject funding received from governments (e.g. state funding) is recorded in other\noperating income, if the research and development costs are incurred and provided that\nthe conditions for the funding have been met.\n125\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(III) Lease Payments\nPayments made under leases for assets which have not been capitalized are recognized as\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(P) Government Grants\nGovernment grants awarded for project funding are recorded in other operating income\nif the research and development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for\nthe funding have been met. Government grants awarded to support continued\nemployment where work is not allowed are recorded as a reduction in the related\nexpense, as this presents the underlying reason for the grant better.\n(Q) Income Tax\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits can be set off against timing differences and tax losses carried forward or taxable\ntemporary differences exist. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no\nlonger probable that the related tax benefit can be realized. The recoverability of\ndeferred tax assets is reviewed at least annually.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between tax\nand commercial balance sheets and for losses brought forward for tax purposes as well as\nfor tax credits of the companies included in consolidation. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities shall be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when\nthe asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nCurrent income taxes for the current and prior periods are recognized as a liability to the\nextent that they have not yet been paid. If the amount attributable to the current and\nprior periods and already paid exceeds the amount due for those periods, the difference\nis recognized as an asset. The amount of the expected tax liability or tax receivable\nreflects the best estimate of the amount, considering tax uncertainties, when applicable.\nThe Group evaluates income tax uncertain treatments on a regular basis. In making this\nassessment, the Group assumes that a tax authority will review the matter in question\nand that it has all the relevant information to do so. If it is probable that an uncertain tax\ntreatment will not be accepted by the tax authorities, the best estimate (expected value\nor most likely value of the tax uncertainty) is used to determine the impact and a tax\nliability is recognized or, in the case of existing loss carryforwards, the deferred tax\nattributable to them is reduced accordingly.\n126\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(R) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in business activities\nand whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision\nMaker, which AIXTRON considers to be its Executive Board, to make decisions about\nresources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which\ndiscrete financial information is available. AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nAccounting standards applied in segment reporting are in accordance with the general\naccounting policies as explained in this section.\n(S) Cash Flow Statement\nCash flows from operating activities are determined using the indirect method.\nCash flows from taxes are allocated to operating activities.\nCash flows from other financial assets (fund investments) are presented in cash flow from\ninvesting activities as the assets are not traded for trading purposes. As the assets are not\ntraded for trading purposes, it is more appropriate to present them in the cash flow from\ninvesting activities as this gives a better insight into the financial position. In the previous\nyear, cash flows from fund investments were reported under cash flow from operating\nactivities. For 2021, EUR 79,862 thousand was reclassified from cash flow from operating\nactivities to cash flow from investing activities.\n127\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(T) Adoption of New and Revised Accounting Standards\nNew and Amended IFRS Standards Effective for the Current Year\nIn the current year, the Group has applied the below amendments to IFRS standards and\ninterpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are\neffective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2022. Their adoption has\nnot had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework\nAmendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds\nbefore Intended Use\nAmendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts – Cost of fulfilling a\ncontract\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Cycle\nInitial application of COVID-19-Related The application of the practical expedient\nRent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021 - for lease concession accounting, which the\nAmendment to IFRS 16 IASB granted with the amendment to IFRS\n16 in 2021 as a direct result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, was extended to\nreduced lease payments originally due on\nor before June 30, 2022.

No reversal of impairment were recognized in fiscal years 2022 and\n2021.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt the end of 2022 the Group assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill and\ndetermined that as in 2021 no impairment loss had to be recognized.\nAs at the end of 2022 the cash generating unit, to which the goodwill has been allocated,\nis the AIXTRON Group Semiconductor Equipment segment.\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined through a fair value\nless cost to sell calculation. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. As AIXTRON has only one cash generating unit (CGU), market\ncapitalization of AIXTRON, adjusted for a control premium, has been used to determine\nthe fair value less cost to sell of the cash generating unit. This is level 2 in the hierarchy of\nfair value measures set out in IFRS 13.\nAs at December 31, 2022 the market capitalization of AIXTRON was EUR 3,031 million,\nbased on a share price of EUR 26.97 and issued shares (excluding Treasury Shares) of\n112,383,196.\nIn an orderly selling process costs are incurred. AIXTRON has used 1.5% to account for the\ncosts to sell.\nA control premium typically in the range 20% - 40% is incurred in the acquisition of a\ncompany. A 20% premium has been applied in this test to adjust the market capitalization\nto the fair value. Market capitalization was also adjusted for net debt and tax assets prior\nto comparing it to the carrying amount of the CGU. The analysis shows that the fair value\nless costs to sell of the CGU AIXTRON exceeds its carrying amount and that Goodwill is not\nimpaired.\n140\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment Test Impairment Test\nEuro millions, except share price 2022 2021\nShare price - Euros 26.97 17.87\nMarket capitalization\n3,031.0 2,005.2\nas of December 31\nCosts to sell in percentage 1.5% 1.5%\nCosts to sell -45.5 -30.1\nMarket capitalization less cost to sell 2,985.5 1,975.1\nControl premium in percentage 20% 20%\nControl premium 597.1 395.0\nMarket capitalization and control\n3,582.6 2,370.1\npremium less cost to sell\nNet debt -325.2 -352.5\nTax assets -33.8 -16.7\nFair value less costs to sell of CGU 3,223.6 2,000.9\nCarrying amount of the CGU 304.4 223.0\nSurplus of fair value less cost to sell\n2,919.2 1,778.0\nover carrying amount\nSurplus of fair value less cost to sell\n959 % 797 %\nover carrying amount as a percentage\nThe fair value less costs to sell, which is the recoverable amount, exceeds the carrying\namount of the CGU by 959% (2021: 797%).\n13.

Generally, the Group demands no securities for financial assets. In\naccordance with usual business practice for capital equipment however, the Group\nmitigates its exposure to credit risk by requiring payment by irrevocable letters of credit\nand substantial payments in advance from most customers as conditions of contracts for\nsale of major items of equipment.\nIn 2022 two customers accounted for 11% and 10% of net trade receivables respectively.\nIn 2021 three customers accounted for 28%, 12% and 12% of net trade receivables\nrespectively. In determining concentrations of credit risk, the Group defines\ncounterparties as having similar characteristics if they are part of the same external group\nof entities.\n145\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncluded in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of\nEUR 17,937 thousand (2021: EUR 2,644 thousand) which are past due at the reporting\ndate for which the Group has not provided. As there has not been a significant change in\ncredit quality, and although the Group has no collateral, the amounts are considered\nrecoverable.\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to the\nlifetime expected credit loss. Based on its experience, the Group uses a negligible risk of\ndefault for lifetime, adjusted for factors which are specific to the debtors, general\neconomic conditions, and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast\ndirection of conditions at the reporting date.\nIn determining receivables which may be individually impaired the Group has taken into\naccount the likelihood of recoverability based on the past due nature of certain\nreceivables, and our assessment of the ability of all counterparties to perform their\nobligations.\n146\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

This is also taken into account when determining dividend\ndistributions. The Group considers its capital resources to be adequate.\n148\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncome and Expenses Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income\nIncome and expenses recognized in other comprehensive income are shown in the state-\nment of other comprehensive income.\nThe foreign currency translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences\narising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries whose\nfunctional currency is not the Euro.\nDuring 2022 an income of EUR 85 thousand (2021: expense EUR 112 thousand) was\nrecorded from the remeasurement of defined benefit obligations in other comprehensive\nincome.\n20.

Executive Board members may first dispose of these shares following a four-year\nholding period calculated from the start of the reference period. Before the start of a\nfiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets for each Executive\nBoard member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive Board member\nreceives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI as a percentage of the\nconsolidated net income for the year pursuant to the budget adopted for the fiscal year.\nThe number of forfeitable stock awards is calculated based on the average of the closing\nprices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter of the previous year.\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for\nthe year and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. The TSR is\ndefined as the total shareholder return over the reference period and is calculated as the\nratio of the share price development including dividends paid at the end of the reference\nperiod to the value at the beginning of the reference period.\nIn this regard, the relative weighting of the targets amounts to 50% for consolidated net\nincome for the year, 40% for TSR, and 10% for sustainability targets. After the expiry of\nthe three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement is determined by\nthe Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement, the forfeitable\nstock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise lapse. The\nmaximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection with LTI is\ncapped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start of the\nreference period.\nThe shares are transferred to the Executive Board member after the four-year restriction\nperiod.\nThe fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is recognized as an\nexpense over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. The\nfair value of the shares granted is measured based on a valuation model taking into\naccount the vesting conditions at which the shares are granted. The calculation takes into\naccount estimates for future dividends. The TSR ratio is used as a market condition in\nestimating the fair value at the valuation date. For the other non-market-based vesting\nconditions, the Group reviews its estimate of the number of equity instruments during\nthe vesting period. Adjustments in the original estimates, if any, are recognized in profit\nor loss and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.\n152\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the main parameters of the valuation model (Monte Carlo\nsimulation) for the long-term variable remuneration of the Executive Board (LTI) for the\nLTI Tranche 2022 and 2021:\nLTI Tranche 2022 LTI Tranche 2021\nI I II\nGrant date 15.12.21 09.12.20 21.12.20\nShare price at grant date 16.77€ 12.95€ 13.64€\nRisk-free interest rate -0.66% -0.82% -0.79%\nVolatility AIXTRON 52.08% 52.47% 52.70%\nVolatility Peer Group 30.41% 33.64% 33.73%\nCorrelation AIXTRON/Index 0.53 0.41 0.41\nFair Value TSR 19.47€ 18.81€ 20.77€\nFair Value Plain-Tranche 15.93€ 12.95€ 13.68€\nIn 2021 there were two grant dates each, due to a later entry date of an Executive Board\nmember.

Financial Instruments\nDetails of the significant accounting policies and methods, the basis of measurement that\nare used in preparing the financial statements and the other accounting policies that are\nrelevant to an understanding of the financial statement are disclosed in note 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\nFinancial Risk Management Objectives\nThe Group seeks to minimize the effects of any risk that may occur from any financial\ntransaction. Key aspects are the exposures to liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk\nand currency risk arising in the normal course of the Group’s business.\nThe AIXTRON Group’s central management coordinates access to domestic and\ninternational financial institutions and monitors and manages the financial risks relating\nto the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyze exposure to\nrisk by likelihood and magnitude. These risks cover all aspects of the business, including\nfinancial risks.\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its existing or future obligations\ndue to insufficient availability of cash or cash equivalents. Managing liquidity risk is one of\n155\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe central tasks of AIXTRON SE. In order to be able to ensure the Group’s solvency and\nflexibility at all times cash and cash equivalents are projected on the basis of regular\nfinancial and liquidity planning.\nAs of December 31, 2022 the Group did not have any borrowings (2021: nil). Financial\nliabilities, all due within one year, of EUR 52,679 thousand (2021: EUR 26,018 thousand)\nconsisting of trade payables and other liabilities and are shown in note 24, together with\nan analysis of their maturity. Non-current payables consist of lease liabilities and other\npayables. Long term lease liabilities of EUR 5,874 thousand (2021: EUR 3,052 thousand)\nare shown with an analysis of their maturity in note 27. Other non-current payables of\nEUR 101 thousand (2021: EUR 244 thousand) are due after more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2022 the Group had EUR 325,411 thousand (2021: EUR 352,694\nthousand) of bank deposits and investments as described in notes 13, 17 and 18.\nCredit Risks\nFinancial assets generally exposed to a credit risk are trade receivables, financial\ninvestments, and cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Group’s cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are kept with financial\ninstitutions that have a good credit standing. Central management of the Group assesses\nthe counter-party risk of each financial institution dealt with and sets limits to the Group’s\nexposure to those institutions. These credit limits are reviewed from time to time so as to\nminimize the default risk as far as possible and to ensure that concentrations of risk are\nmanaged.\nThe maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk is the total amount of receivables,\nfinancial assets and bank deposits as described in notes 13, 16, 17 and 18.\nFor contract assets measured at fair value, the maximum amount of the exposure to\ncredit risk is the amount of contract assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 25.\nThere are no credit derivatives or similar instruments which mitigate the maximum\nexposure to credit risk and there has been no change during the period or cumulatively in\nthe fair value of such receivables that is attributable to changes in the credit risk.\nMarket Risks\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates and interest rate risks. Interest rate risks are not material as the Group\nonly receives a minor amount of interest income. The Group does not use derivative\nfinancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Cash deposits are made\nwith the Group’s bankers at the market rates prevailing at inception of the deposit for the\nperiod and currency concerned. The Group’s financial investments are made into funds\nbases in the European Union and are exposed to changes in the market value of those\nfunds. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the manner in\nwhich it manages and measures the risk.\n156\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Group can enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its\nexposure to foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts to hedge the\nexchange rate risk arising on the export of equipment. The main exchange rates giving\nrise to the risk are those between the US Dollar, GB Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Euro.\nNo forward exchange contracts were entered into in the fiscal year or in the previous\nyear.\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nmonetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:\nAssets Liabilities\nin EUR thousands 2022 2021 2022 2021\nUS Dollars 65,057 83,157 51,305 46,041\nGB Pounds 6,079 10,827 4,175 2,198\nChinese Renminbi 25,303 18,726 8,891 3,666\nExposures are reviewed on a regular basis and are managed by the Group through\nsensitivity analysis.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity Analysis\nThe Group's global operations expose it primarily to foreign exchange risks by the US\nDollar, GB Pound and Chinese Renminbi.\nThe following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% change in the value of the\nEuro against the US Dollar, GB Pound and Chinese Renminbi.

It\nis calculated by revaluing the Group's financial assets and liabilities, existing at 31\nDecember, denominated in US Dollars, GB Pounds or Chinese Renminbi by 10%. It does\nnot represent the effect of a 10% change in exchange rates sustained over the whole of\nthe fiscal year, only the effect of a different rate occurring on the last day of the year.\n157\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Values and Contract Assets\nCash and cash equivalents, receivables are stated at amortized cost.

Advance Payments – Contract Liabilities\nContract liabilities for advance payments from customers occur when a contract requires\nthe customer to pay a deposit to the Group and the deposit has actually been paid,\ntypically near the commencement of the contract, or if it reflects an unconditional\npayment claim. Usually, advance payments are up to 50% of the total contract price.\nThe Group records the liability as the advance payment is received and eliminates the\nliability at the same time and up to the same amount as it records revenue until the\nliability is fully extinguished. Changes in contract liabilities for advance payments in the\nyear reflect the changing level of outstanding customer orders.\nRevenues of EUR 60,821 thousand were realized in 2022 from the EUR 77,041 thousand\nof contract liabilities for advance payments outstanding at the end of 2021. Revenues of\nEUR 40,728 thousand were realized in 2021 from the EUR 50,824 thousand of contract\nliabilities for advance payments outstanding at the end of 2020. In 2022 no revenue was\nrecognized from performance obligations that were settled in prior years.\n159\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources\nof Estimation and Uncertainty\nThe preparation of AIXTRON’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management\nto make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that the Group believes are\nreasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions\naffect the reported amounts and related disclosures and are made in order to fairly\npresent the Group’s financial position and results of operations. The following accounting\npolicies are significantly impacted by these estimates and judgments that AIXTRON\nbelieves are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported\nfinancial results:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue for the supply of most equipment to customers is generally recognized in two\nstages, partly on delivery and partly on final installation and acceptance (see note 2 (N)).\nWhen allocating the transaction price to the two performance obligations, delivery of the\ntool and installation of the tool, assumptions are made regarding individual margins as\npart of the cost-plus method. The Group believes, based on past experience, that this\nmethod of recognizing revenue fairly states the revenues of the Group. For the reporting\nperiods 2022 and 2021, 10% of the installation revenue was allocated to installation\nperformance.\n166\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe judgements made by management include an assessment of the point at which\ncontrol has passed to the customer.\nValuation of Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This requires the\nGroup to make judgments concerning obsolescence of materials. This evaluation requires\nestimates, including both forecasted product demand and pricing environment, both of\nwhich may be susceptible to significant change. The carrying amount of inventories and\ndetails on impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses in the fiscal year are\ndisclosed in notes 3 and 15. In future periods, impairment losses may be necessary due to\nvarious factors such as decreasing product demand or technological obsolescence. These\nfactors could result in adjustment to the valuation of inventory in future periods, and\nsignificantly impact the Group’s future operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether the realization of future tax\nbenefits is sufficiently probable to recognize deferred tax assets. This assessment requires\nthe exercise of judgement on the part of management with respect to future taxable\nincome. The parent company AIXTRON SE does generally not exceed a planning horizon\nof twelve months. The recorded amount of total deferred tax assets could be reduced or\nincreased if estimates of projected future taxable income are lowered or increased, or if\nchanges in current tax regulations are enacted that impose restrictions on the timing or\nextent of the Group’s ability to utilize future tax benefits. The carrying amount of\ndeferred tax assets is disclosed in note 14.\nProvisions\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. At each balance sheet date, the\nGroup assesses the valuation of the liabilities which have been recorded as provisions and\nadjusts them if necessary. Because of the uncertain nature of the timing or amounts of\nprovisions, judgement has to be exercised by the Group with respect to their valuation.\nActual liabilities may differ from the estimated amounts. Details of provisions are shown\nin note 23.\nLegal proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and\nclaims. The Company, based upon advice from legal counsel, believes that the matters\nthe Group is aware of are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition or results of operations. The Group is not aware of any unasserted claims that\nmay have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation.\nSignificant external influences\nThe global impact of the Corona pandemic and the Russia/Ukraine conflict on business\noperations is explained in the combined management report. The impact on the 2022\nconsolidated financial statements is immaterial and it is also expected that the impact on\nfiscal year 2023 will be immaterial. Climate risks also did not have a material impact on\nthe business operations of AIXTRON.\n167\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n38.

In addition, we have audited the combined\nmanagement report of AIXTRON SE for the financial year from January 1 to December 31,\n2022.\nIn accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those\ncomponents of the combined management report specified in the \"Other Information\"\nsection of our auditor's report.\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects,\nwith the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German\nCommercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair\nview of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31,\n2022, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to\nDecember 31, 2022, and\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an\nappropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined\nmanagement report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,\ncomplies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the\nopportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined\nmanagement report does not cover the content of those components of the\ncombined management report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of the\nauditor's report.\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any\nreservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and\nof the combined management report.\n170\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nBasis for the Opinions\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined\nmanagement report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No\n537/2014 (referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with\nGerman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the\nInstitut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our\nresponsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the\n\"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of\nthe Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent\nof the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German\ncommercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with\nArticle 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-\naudit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that\nthe evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\nopinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most\nsignificance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year\nfrom January 1 to December 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of\nour audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion\nthereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nExistence of revenues and revenue recognition cut-off for spare parts\nPlease refer to Note 2 (N) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions used. For a\nbreakdown of revenues, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\nThe Company generated revenues from spare parts of EUR 76 million in the financial year\nfrom January 1 to December 31, 2022.\nAIXTRON recognizes revenues when (or as) it fulfils a performance obligation through the\ntransfer of a promised asset to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the\ncustomer obtains control of that asset. Revenues from spare parts are recognized solely\nat a point in time.\nRevenues from spare parts are based on a large number of business transactions.\nRevenues are one of the Group's most important indicators of target achievement and\nadditionally form a significant basis for decisions for the users of financial statements.\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that revenues from spare parts\nare recognized without actual performance having been rendered. Further, there is the\nrisk that revenues from spare parts are not recognized on an accrual basis.\n171\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nOUR AUDIT APPROACH\nIn order to examine the recognition of revenues from spare parts, we assessed the\ndesign, setup and effectiveness of internal controls relating to order acceptance, outgoing\ngoods and invoicing, in particular the determination and verification of the actual transfer\nof control.\nIn addition, on the basis of a mathematical and statistical procedure we selected revenue\ntransactions in spare parts that were recorded in financial year 2022 and evaluated these\nby reconciling them with the underlying invoices, related orders, contracts and external\ndelivery records.\nIn order to evaluate revenues on an accrual basis, we assessed the applicable point in\ntime and the amount of revenues recognized by reconciling invoices to the related orders,\nexternal delivery records and payments received. The basis for this were revenues that\nwere selected using a mathematical and statistical procedure and were recognized in a\nset period before the year-end closing date. Based on risk, we examined the credits\nissued for a certain period after the closing date and evaluated whether these required\nfurther evaluation in respect of the matching principle.\nOUR OBSERVATIONS\nThe procedure used for the recognition of revenues and the revenue recognition cut-off\nfor spare parts is appropriate.\nOther Information\nManagement and/or the Supervisory Board are/is responsible for the other information.\nThe other information comprises the following components of the combined\nmanagement report, whose content was not audited:\n• the Group's separate non-financial statement, which is referred to in the combined\nmanagement report,\n• the combined corporate governance statement for the Company and the Group\nreferred to in the combined management report, and\n• information extraneous to combined management reports and marked as\nunaudited.\nThe other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report. The other\ninformation does not include the consolidated financial statements, the combined\nmanagement report information audited for content and our auditor's report thereon.\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n172\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so\ndoing, to consider whether the other information\n• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the\ncombined management report information audited for content or our knowledge\nobtained in the audit, or\n• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material\nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have\nnothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that\ncomply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional\nrequirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the\nconsolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and\nfair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the\nGroup. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as they have\ndetermined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial\nreporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for\nassessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the\nresponsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition,\nthey are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of\naccounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or\nthere is no realistic alternative but to do so.\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the combined\nmanagement report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's\nposition and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the\nopportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible\nfor such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to\nenable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the\napplicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate\nevidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting\nprocess for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined\nmanagement report.\n173\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nand of the Combined Management Report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an\nappropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with\nthe consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies\nwith the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and\nrisks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our\nopinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit\nconducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in\ncompliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits\npromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material\nmisstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material\nif, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements\nand this combined management report.\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the\naudit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The\nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the\nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override\nof internal controls.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the\naudit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the\nreasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on\nthe Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined\nmanagement report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective\nopinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date\n174\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nof our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group\nto cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner\nthat the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,\nliabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance\nwith IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of\nthe entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We\nremain solely responsible for our opinions.\n• Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated\nfinancial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's\nposition it provides.\n• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by\nmanagement in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient\nappropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions\nused by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the\nproper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do\nnot express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the\nassumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future\nevents will differ materially from the prospective information.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,\nthe planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any\nsignificant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied\nwith the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all\nrelationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our\nindependence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate\nindependence threats.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine\nthose matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe\nthese matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure\nabout the matter.\n175\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nOther Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report Prepared for\nPublication Purposes in Accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the combined management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\")\ncontained in the electronic file “aix-2022-12-31-de.zip” (SHA256-\nHashwert:1772e9329d8490353d52df330ed73e1463517c1493725542d7493f784fbf3760)\nmade available and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects\nwith the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF\nformat\").

The 9M/2022 order intake of\nEUR 425.6 million is at a very high level, 13% above the order intake in the same period of\nthe previous year (9M/2021: EUR 377.6 million). The equipment order backlog as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, has increased to EUR 369.4 million (9M/2021: EUR 267.6 million).\nRevenues in the third quarter of 2022 at EUR 88.9 million were below the prior-year\nquarter (Q3/2021: EUR 130.8 million). This was mainly due to a few customer-related\ndelivery delays and the granting of export licenses, which were not yet available as of the\nreporting date. Accordingly, the gross profit of the third quarter of 2022 amounted to\nEUR 39.3 million (Q3 2021: EUR 56.3 million). Changes in the product mix led to an\nimprovement in the gross margin of the third quarter of 2022 to 44% (Q3/2021: 43%).\nDue to the unabated strong demand and stable supply chains, the Executive Board\ncontinues to expect significant growth for the year with increasing margins and order\nintake. The growth guidance for full year 2022, was therefore upgraded. Accordingly, the\nexpected order intake will now range between EUR 540 and 600 million (previously:\nbetween EUR 520 and 580 million); expected revenues are unchanged between EUR 450\nand 500 million; expected gross margin: now approximately 42% (previously:\napproximately 41%); expected EBIT margin: now between approximately 22% and 24%\n(previously: between approximately 21% and 23%).\nAt EUR 142.8 million in Q3/2022, order intake significantly exceeded the level of the\nprior-year quarter (Q3/2021: EUR 114.2 million). This development is particularly\nattributable to the very encouraging demand from the area of power electronics based\non GaN and SiC. The recently introduced G10-SiC system already accounted for the\nhighest share of total order intake in the quarter of its market launch.\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nRevenues were EUR 88.9 million in Q3/2022 (Q3/2021: EUR 130.8 million; Q2/2022: EUR\n102.5 million) due to the reasons mentioned above. Gross profit in Q3/2022 was at EUR\n39.3 million with a gross margin of 44% (Q3/2021: EUR 56.3 million, 43%; Q2/2022: EUR\n37.8 million, 37%). At EUR 23.1 million, operating expenses in Q3/2022 were higher than\nthe corresponding figure of the previous year (Q3/2021: EUR 20.1 million; Q2/2022: EUR\n20.6 million) mainly due to higher variable compensation components and lower R&D\ngrants. With an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 16.2 million and an EBIT margin of 18%\n(Q3/2021: EUR 36.2 million, 28%; Q2/2022: EUR 17.2 million, 17%), net profit in the third\nquarter of 2022 amounted to EUR 19.1 million (Q3/2021: EUR 31.4 million; Q2/2022: EUR\n17.3 million).\nFree cash flow in Q3/2022 was EUR (7.5) million (Q3/2021: EUR (19.0) million; Q2/2022:\nEUR 4.0 million). The deviation from the previous quarter is mainly due to a strong\nincrease in inventories in preparation for exceptionally high shipments in the fourth\nquarter of 2022.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of EUR 339.2\nmillion as of September 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 352.5 million; September 30,\n2021: EUR 330.7 million). The change compared to December 31, 2021 is mainly due to\nthe dividend payment in May 2022. The equity ratio at September 30, 2022 was 75%\n(December 31, 2021: 80%; September 30, 2021: 78%).\nOverall, the current global crisis situations and market developments continue to have\nonly a minor impact on our business. Logistics and supply chains are tense, but in our\nview remain stable overall.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(\"AIXTRON\" or \"the Company\") is provided in the Annual Report 2021. There were no\nchanges in this regard in the first nine months of fiscal year 2022. The report is publicly\navailable on the Company's website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nThe high level of R&D expertise remains of great strategic importance to AIXTRON, as it\nensures a competitive portfolio of leading-edge technologies and supports future\nbusiness development. As an example of the Group's current research activities, the\n\"GaN4AP - GaN for Advanced Power Applications\" project is currently underway. The\nEU-funded project aims to make GaN-based electronics the primary technology in all\npower conversion systems. The project aims to develop innovative power electronic\nsystems, innovative materials and a new generation of vertical power devices based on\nGaN.\nAIXTRON sees environmental protection as a key factor in the sustainability of its\nbusiness model. This applies both to the company's own activities and to its suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Further information can be\nfound in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2021 on the AIXTRON website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n9M 2022 9M 2021 +/-\nin EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 425.6 377.6 48.0 13%\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 369.4 267.6 101.8 38%\n9M/2022 order intake increased by 13% year-on-year to EUR 425.6 million (9M/2021:\nEUR 377.6 million). This reflects the continued high demand across almost all end\nmarkets, but especially for efficient power electronics based on the material systems\ngallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) as well as equipment for the production of\nmicro LEDs. At EUR 142.8 million in Q3/2022, order intake was significantly above the\nlevel of the previous year (Q3/2021: EUR 114.2 million; Q2/2022: EUR 152.6 million).\nThe total equipment order backlog as of September 30, 2022 was EUR 369.4 million, also\nsignificantly higher than both the previous year (September 30, 2021: EUR 267.6 million)\nand the previous quarter (June 30, 2022: EUR 314.4 million million). Most of this order\nbacklog is scheduled for delivery in 2022.\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first nine months of 2022 was 1.08 USD/EUR (Q1/2022:\n1.13 USD/EUR; Q2/2022: 1.08 USD/EUR; Q3/2022; 1.02 USD/EUR), which compares to\n1.20 USD/EUR in 9M/2021. Thus, compared to the same period of the previous year, the\nUS dollar was 10% stronger in 9M/2022, having a corresponding impact on AIXTRON\nGroup’s US dollar denominated revenues and results in the period.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of 2022 amounted to EUR 279.9 million and\nwere EUR 31.8 million or 13% higher year-on-year (9M/2021: EUR 248.1 million).\nRevenues in Q3/2022 were below the prior-year quarter at EUR 88.9 million (Q3/2021:\nEUR 130.8 million; Q2/2022: EUR 102.5 million). This difference is mainly due to a few\ncustomer-related delivery delays and the granting of export licenses, which were not yet\navailable as of the reporting date.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, more than 50% of equipment revenues were generated with\nequipment for power electronics, with SiC applications accounting for the largest share.\nAnother significant revenue share of more than 40% was contributed by the business\nwith systems for the production of lasers, in particular for optical data transmission and\n3D sensor technology.\nEquipment revenues in 9M/2022 were EUR 218.4 million, representing 78% of the total\nrevenues in the period (9M/2021: EUR 204.3 million; 82%).

Gross profit in first nine months of 2022 was significantly influenced by the\ndelivery of equipment for the production of traditional red LEDs in the first half of the\nyear, which have a comparatively low margin, while in the third quarter sales for power\nelectronics contributed to an improvement in the gross margin.\nOperating expenses of EUR 65.4 million slightly increased in the first nine months of 2022\ncompared to the previous year (9M/2021: EUR 60.3 million; Q3/2022: EUR 23.1 million;\nQ2/2022: EUR 20.6 million).

This consists of a tax expense from current\ntaxes of EUR 7.2 million (9M/2021: EUR 7.2 million) and a tax income from deferred taxes\nof EUR 9.6 million (9M/2021: tax income from deferred taxes of EUR 9.1 million.) The\ndeferred tax income in the current fiscal year and in the previous year results mainly from\nthe capitalization of deferred taxes on loss carryforwards in the amount of EUR 9.4 million\ndue to expected future taxable profits (9M/2021: EUR 7.9 million; Q3/2022: EUR 5.6\nmillion, Q2/2022: EUR 2.6 million).\nThe Company’s net result in the first nine months of 2022 amounted to EUR 50.2 million\n(9M/2021: EUR 42.9 million; Q3/2022: EUR 19.1 million; Q2/2022: EUR 17.3 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of September 30, 2022 as well as\nDecember 31, 2021.\nTotal equity as of September 30, 2022, increased to EUR 614.7 million compared to EUR\nEUR 592.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The main influencing factors were the net\nresult and the dividend payment of AIXTRON SE. The equity ratio as of September 30,\n2022, was 75% compared to 80% as at 31 December 2021 mainly due to the higher\nbalance sheet total resulting from increased customer prepayments.\nCash, cash equivalents and other financial assets decreased to EUR 339.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, compared to EUR 352.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The\ndifference is mainly due to the dividend payment of EUR 33.7 million, paid in May 2022.\nOther financial assets as of September 30, 2022, include fund investments of EUR 199.8\nmillion (December 31, 2021: EUR 141.6 million), and short-term bank deposits of EUR 0.0\nmillion (December 31, 2021: EUR 60.0 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2022, increased to EUR 88.1 million\ncompared to EUR 74.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures in the fiscal\nyear mainly included laboratory equipment and expansions. In addition, rights of use for\nleased space were capitalized.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 73.5 million as of September 30, 2022, compared to EUR\n72.3 million as of December 31, 2021. There were no indications of impairment in the\nfirst nine months of 2022. The changes in value compared with December 31, 2021 are\nattributable to exchange rate fluctuations.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to\nEUR 209.2 million as of September 30, 2022, compared to EUR 120.6 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021, mainly due to the preparation for exceptionally high shipments in\nthe fourth quarter.\nTrade receivables as of September 30, 2022, amounted to EUR 48.7 million (December\n31, 2021: EUR 81.0 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in the\nthird quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The average day’s sales\noutstanding of receivables were 28 days (December 31, 2021: 23 days).\nContract liabilities from advance payments received amounted to EUR 121.8 million as\nof September 30, 2022, compared to EUR 77.0 million as of December 31, 2021, thus\nreflecting the current order situation.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments in property plant &\nequipment as well as intangible assets + proceeds from disposals) was EUR 19.0 million in\n9M/2022 (9M/2021: EUR 27.1 million; Q3/2022: EUR (7.5) million; Q2/2022: EUR 4.0\nmillion). Free cash flow was generated mainly from current net income for the period,\nwith the increase in inventories having an offsetting effect.\nOpportunities and Risks\nIn the course of the first nine months of 2022, the Executive Board has not identified any\nsignificant additions or changes to the opportunities and risks presented in the Annual\nReport for fiscal 2021. The risks arising from the current global crisis situations and\nmarket developments continue to be assessed as not significant because it has been\nshown that demand for our products has not been significantly affected and our supply\nchains, although strained, are nevertheless functioning reliably.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2021 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nDue to the good business development in the first nine months and in view of the\ncontinued positive assessment of the development of demand and product mix, the\nExecutive Board upgrades the 2022 growth guidance.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board now expects order intake in a range between EUR 540\nmillion and EUR 600 million (previously between EUR 520 million and EUR 580 million) for\nthe financial year 2022. With unchanged revenues in a range between EUR 450 million\nand EUR 500 million, the Executive Board expects to achieve a gross margin of now\napproximately 42% (previously approximately 41%) and an EBIT margin of now\napproximately 22% to 24% (previously approximately 21% to 23%) of revenues in fiscal\nyear 2022.\nAs before, the expectations for 2022 are subject to the provision that global crisis\nsituations or market developments do not have a significant impact on the development\nof the business.\nStarting from a very high level, the Executive Board aims to slightly increase the share of\nenvironmentally sustainable revenues (2021: 57% of revenues), capital expenditures\nCapEx (2021: 39% of capital expenditures) and operating expenditures OpEx (2021: 76%\nof operating expenditures) in the medium term in line with the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the further development of the global\neconomy and trading in order to be able to assess any potential effects on the Company's\nown supply chain and production as well as on customer demand and thus on AIXTRON's\nbusiness development at any time and – if necessary – to initiate corrective measures.\nFurther details on the annual guidance can be found in the “Expected Developments”\nsection of the Annual Report 2021, which is available on the Company‘s website

The H1/2022 order intake of\nEUR 282.8 million is at a very high level, 7% above the order intake in the same period of\nthe previous year (H1/2021: EUR 263.3 million). The equipment order backlog as of June\n30, 2022, has increased to EUR 314.4 million (H1/2021: EUR 295.0 million).\nH1/2022 revenues increased by 63% year-on-year to EUR 191.1 million (H1/2021:\nEUR 117.2 million). First half 2022 gross profit increased by 63% year-on-year to EUR 73.7\nmillion and the H1/2022 gross margin was 39% (H1/2021: 39%).\nDue to the continuously strong demand, the Executive Board anticipates further\nsignificant revenue growth with corresponding margins as well as order intake at high\nlevels for the current fiscal year and therefore reconfirms the growth guidance for fiscal\nyear 2022 issued in February this year.\nAt EUR 152.6 million in Q2/2022, order intake has even exceeded the level of the strong\nprevious quarter (Q1/2022: EUR 130.2 million) as well as the same quarter of the\nprevious year (Q2/2021: EUR 139.0 million). This development was driven by continued\nstrong demand for AIXTRON technologies across nearly all end markets. The strongest\ndriver in the quarter was the area of LEDs, including Micro LEDs followed by GaN and SiC\npower electronics. Of particular note was the receipt of the first order for volume\nproduction of Micro LEDs.\n4\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nRevenues increased by 51% year-on-year to EUR 102.5 million in Q2/2022 (Q2/2021:\nEUR 67.7 million). Compared to the previous quarter, they were 16% higher (Q1/2022:\nEUR 88.6 million). The gross profit in Q2/2022 was significantly influenced by a product\nmix with a comparatively low margin. In addition, one-off costs were incurred from\nprojects to strengthen production and supply chain. Nevertheless, gross profit increased\nby 36% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 37.8 million with a gross margin of 37%\n(Q2/2021: EUR 27.9 million, 41%; Q1/2022: EUR 35.9 million, 41%). At EUR 20.6 million,\noperating expenses in Q2/2022 were below the corresponding figure of the previous year\n(Q2/2021: EUR 22.3 million; Q1/2022: EUR 21.7 million). With an operating result (EBIT)\nof EUR 17.2 million and an EBIT margin of 17% (Q2/2021: EUR 5.6 million, 8%; Q1/2022:\nEUR 14.2 million, 16%), net profit in Q2/2022 more than doubled year-on-year to\nEUR 17.3 million (Q2/2021: EUR 7.7 million; Q1/2022: EUR 13.8 million).\nFree cash flow in Q2/2022 was EUR 4.0 million (Q2/2021: EUR 18.0 million; Q1/2022:\nEUR 22.4 million). This development is mainly due to an increase in inventories and trade\nreceivables with a simultaneous increase in advance payments received for customer\norders compared to March 31, 2022.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of\nEUR 346.2 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 352.5 million; June 30,\n2021: EUR 348.2 million). The change is mainly due to cash inflows from trade receivables\nand the cash outflow from the dividend payment in May 2022. The equity ratio at June\n30, 2022 was 78% (December 31, 2021: 80%; June 30, 2021: 73%).\nOverall, the current global crisis situations and market developments continue to have\nonly a minor impact on our business. Logistics and supply chains are tense, but in our\nview remain stable overall.\n5\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group\n(“AIXTRON”, “the AIXTRON Group” or “the Company”) can be found in the Annual Report\n2021. There were no changes in the first half of 2022. The Report is publicly available for\ndownload on the Company’s website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON’s R&D capability remains of important strategic significance, as it provides for a\ncompetitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the future business\ndevelopment. AIXTRON invests specifically in research and development projects in\norder to maintain or expand its leading technological position in MOCVD equipment for\napplications such as lasers, Micro LEDs, specialty LEDs, and the production of wide-band-\ngap materials for power electronics. In addition, work is being done on novel 2D\nnanostructures, which are seen as having great potential in research in line with\ninternational predictions (roadmaps).\nOne example of the Group's current research work is the project called \"OIP4NWE -\nOpen-Innovation Photonics pilot for NWE\". Here, AIXTRON is researching integrated\nphotonics together with the Technical University of Eindhoven. This new technology has\nthe potential to revolutionize communication technology, medical diagnostics and\nmeasurement technologies. A newly developed, automated MOCVD reactor for optimal\nlayer quality and with high productivity is now available for research and for pilot\nproduction of optoelectronic integrated circuits in Eindhoven.\nEnvironmental protection and the responsible use of resources are seen as an important\npart of the business strategy. This applies both to our own activities and to our suppliers.\nAIXTRON's innovative technologies and products make a decisive contribution to this.\nAgainst this background, AIXTRON has further expanded its activities in the area of\nSustainability & ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). Since fiscal year 2021, AIXTRON\nhas already been voluntarily reporting on the EU Taxonomy conformity of its business\nactivities in accordance with the new EU Taxonomy Regulation. The very good results\nachieved underline the sustainability of the Group's business activities. In addition,\npositive ESG ratings from various rating agencies show that AIXTRON has a strong focus\non this issue and plays a significant role on the path to carbon neutrality. Further\ninformation can be found in our Sustainability Report (ESG Report) 2021 on the AIXTRON\nwebsite at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEconomic Report\nMacroeconomic developments\nThe general conditions for the global economy have not improved in the first half of 2022.\nThe not yet fully restored performance of global supply chains was again burdened by\nrecurring lockdowns in China. The resulting supply bottlenecks combined with continuing\nhigh demand, fueled by economic stimulus programs to overcome the pandemic and the\nlow interest rate policy pursued by central banks until recently, resulted in increasing\ninflationary pressure. This was further exacerbated by the war between Russia and\nUkraine. The impact of the war on the Ukrainian economy and the far-reaching sanctions\nimposed by many countries against Russia meant that both countries largely ceased to be\nsuppliers of important products. This was reflected in particular in sharply rising\ncommodity prices, for example for energy, food, and metals, and caused inflation rates to\nshoot up further worldwide. Central banks reacted to this by abandoning their expansive\nmonetary policy much faster and more strongly than originally planned. On June 15,\n2022, for example, the U.S. Federal Reserve resolved the biggest increase in key interest\nrates since 1994. These interest rate hikes are intended to reduce excess demand and\nthus have a dampening effect on economic growth. In this environment, the IMF\nsignificantly reduced its growth forecasts for the current year in its World Economic\nOutlook of April 2022. For fiscal 2022, the IMF now expects global economic output to\ngrow by 3.6% (-0.8 percentage points compared with January 2022) after a 6.1% growth\nin 2021. The expected growth rate for the advanced economies is 3.3% (2021: 5.2%),\nwhile the growth rate for the emerging and developing economies is expected to be 3.8%\n(2021: 6.8%). Global trade is expected to grow by 5.0% (2021: 10.1%). The situation in the\nstrongly export-oriented German machinery and plant engineering sector also became\nincreasingly dampened over the course of the year. According to reports from the\nGerman Engineering Federation (VDMA), order intake grew by just 5% in the first five\nmonths of the year.\nDemand for AIXTRON's products continues to be largely dependent on industry-specific\ndevelopments, such as the introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, IT\ninfrastructure, electromobility, or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor\nmarket. Demand there continued to be very robust overall, partly due to the trend\ntowards digitalization, which was reinforced by the pandemic.\nOverall, the current global crisis situations and market developments continue to have\nonly a minor impact on our business. Logistics and supply chains are tense, but in our\nview remain stable overall.\n7\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIndustry developments\nLasers that can be produced on AIXTRON systems have a wide range of applications in the\nfields of 3D sensor technology and optical data communication: According to the market\nresearch company Yole Développement, consumer electronics will be the main driver of\ndemand for lasers in 3D sensor technology in the coming years. In addition, edge and\nsurface emitting lasers for 3D sensing are increasingly being used in the industrial and\nautomotive sectors. Yole expects a strong increase in demand for these components by\n2024, especially from the automotive industry, as an element for distance measurement\nin driver assistance systems and in autonomous vehicles. The market for Laser for optical\ndata communication at the speed of light will be positively influenced in particular by the\nincreasing use of cloud computing and Internet services such as video on demand and\nmusic streaming as well as by the communication of networked devices via the Internet\n(“Internet of Things”).\nIn addition, the area of power electronics is a significant growth market for AIXTRON:\nPower semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials enable the production\nof very compact and highly efficient AC-DC and DC-DC converters, which are used in a\nwide range of applications. These range from low power (e.g., power supply of smart\nphones) to high power (e.g., fast charging station for electric vehicles). Power devices\nmade of the materials silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) are gaining market\nshare in the overall power device market at an increasing rate. GaN semiconductor\ndevices are mainly used in low and medium power and voltage applications, such as high-\nperformance and energy-efficient power supplies for smartphones and laptops, wireless\ncharging, and power supplies for servers and other IT infrastructure. Furthermore, GaN\nsemiconductor devices are increasingly used in high frequency applications such as 5G\ntelecommunication networks. WBG power devices based on Silicon carbide are\nparticularly suitable for use in higher power and voltage classes. Areas of application are\nprimarily electric vehicles and their fast-charging stations, but also photovoltaic and wind\nenergy converters and other electric drives. In these applications, SiC enables a significant\nreduction in conversion losses, resulting in a greater range per battery charge in vehicles\nand a higher amount of energy delivered in the area of power generation. Due to the\nwide range of applications and high efficiency, industry experts expect strong growth for\nboth GaN and SiC devices in the coming years.\nIn the area of optoelectronics, Micro LEDs represent the greatest growth potential\naccording to LEDinside. Potential drivers include large-area screens as well as very small\ndisplays in various end-uses such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and notebooks.\nMicro LED technology is currently still in the development stage, so estimates of future\nmarket size by various analysts still diverge widely.\nBut also, according to Yole, the market for red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) is\npredicted to continue growing due to the worldwide use of direct emitting, large area LED\ndisplay walls or backlighting units. Another small segment of the LED market addressed\nby AIXTRON is the market for ultraviolet LEDS (UV LEDs). These are used for curing\nplastics, for disinfecting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking)water. Due to increased\nhygiene awareness, this market is expected to gain importance in the future.\nThe growth forecasts for the market segments described here in detail are listed in the\neconomic report of our Annual Report 2021. We consider these forecasts to remain valid.\n8\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAccording to the latest analysis by the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON has\nfurther extended its global market leadership for MOCVD equipment in 2021. According\nto this analysis, AIXTRON's market share increased to 75%, followed by AMEC (China)\nwith 14% and Veeco (USA) with 11%.\n9\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\nH1 2022 H1 2021 +/-\nIn EUR million M EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 282.8 263.3 19.5 7%\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 314.4 295.0 19.4 7%\nH1 2022 order intake increased by around 7% year-on-year to EUR 282.8 million (H1\n2021: EUR 263.3 million). This reflects the continued high demand across nearly all end\nmarkets, but especially for equipment for the production of Micro LEDs as well as\nefficient power electronics based on the material systems silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium\nnitride (GaN). At EUR 152.6 million in Q2 2022, order intake exceeded the already high\nlevel of the previous and prior year quarters (Q1 2022: EUR 130.2 million; Q2 2021: EUR\n139.0 million).\nThe total equipment order backlog as of June 30, 2022 was EUR 314.4 million, also\nsignificantly higher than both the previous year (H1 2021: EUR 295.0 million) and the\nprevious quarter (Q1 2022: EUR 260.4 million). Most of this order backlog is scheduled for\ndelivery in 2022.\nIn line with a strict internal process, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These\nconditions include the following requirements:\n• the receipt of a firm written purchase order,\n• the receipt of an agreed down payment,\n• accessibility to the required shipping documentation,\n• a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Management Board\nreserves the right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is\nsufficiently likely to occur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, Management\ncomes to the conclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or\ninvolves an unacceptable degree of risk, Management will exclude this specific order or a\nportion of this order from the recorded order intake and order backlog figures until the\nrisk has decreased to an acceptable level. The order backlog is regularly assessed and - if\nnecessary - adjusted in line with potential execution risks.\n10\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses\ndenominated in US dollars in the first six months of 2022 was 1.10 USD/EUR (Q1 2022:\n1.13 USD/EUR; Q2 2022: 1.08 USD/EUR), which compares to 1.21 USD/EUR in H1 2021.\nThus, compared to the same period of the previous year, the US dollar was 9% stronger in\nH1/2022, having a corresponding impact on AIXTRON Group’s US dollar denominated\nrevenues and earnings in the period.\n11\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first six months of 2022 amounted to EUR 191.1 million and were\nthus EUR 73.9 million or 63% higher year-on-year (H1 2021: EUR 117.2 million). This is\nmainly the result of the order intake in the relevant period of the previous year, which is\nnow reflected in the revenue development - once the systems have been delivered.\nCompared to the previous quarter, revenues in Q2 2022 increased by 16% to EUR 102.5\nmillion (Q1 2022: EUR 88.6 million). 24% of the equipment revenue in Q2 was generated\nparticularly with equipment for optical data transmission and 5G applications. Another\nsignificant share with 29% of sales was contributed by the business with systems for\npower electronics, with an increasing share of SiC applications. As expected, a significant\nproportion of revenues was generated by shipments for traditional red LED equipment\n(around 43%) but also included shipments for Micro LED applications.\nEquipment revenues in H1 2022 were EUR 148.6 million, representing 78% of the total\nH1 2022 revenues (H1 2021: EUR 91.6 million; 78%). In the second quarter 2022,\nequipment revenues amounted to EUR 82.3 million or 80% of revenues (Q2 2021: EUR\n53.4 million; 79%; Q1 2022: EUR 66.3 million; 75%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nH1 2022 H1 2021 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nEquipment revenues 148.6 78 91.6 78 57.0 62\nRevenues from service,\n42.4 22 25.7 22 16.7 65\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 191.1 100 117.2 100 73.9 63\nRevenues by Region\nH1 2022 H1 2021 +/-\nM EUR % M EUR % M EUR %\nAsia 133.2 70 73.0 62 60.3 83\nEurope 30.5 16 37.1 32 -6.6 -18\nAmericas 27.3 14 7.1 6 20.2 283\nTotal 191.1 100 117.2 100 73.9 63\n12\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nH1 2022 H1 2021 +/-\nM EUR % Rev.

Gross profit in the 1st half of 2022 was significantly influenced by the delivery of\nequipment for the production of traditional red LEDs, which have a comparatively low\nmargin. In addition, one-off project costs were incurred to optimize production and\nsupply chain processes.\nOperating expenses of EUR 42.3 million increased in H1/2022 compared to the previous\nyear (H1/2021: EUR 40.2 million; Q2/2022: EUR 20.6 million; Q1/2022: EUR 21.7 million).\nIncreased R&D expenses and higher variable compensation components contributed to\nthe increase in operating expenses in H1/2022. Compared to Q1/2022, 2nd quarter 2022\noperating expenses decreased by EUR 1.1 million, with lower R&D grants offset by lower\nR&D expenses.\nR&D expenses in H1/2022 remained stable compared to the same period of the previous\nyear, increasing only slightly by EUR 0.6 million to EUR 27.3 million (H1/2021:\nEUR 26.7 million; Q2/2022: EUR 13.2 million; Q1/2022: EUR 14.1 million).

This reflects in particular R&D grants of EUR 2.2\nmillion.\n13\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved year-on-year from EUR 4.9 million in H1/2021 to\nEUR 31.4 million in H1 2022 (Q2/2022: EUR 17.2 million; Q1/2022: EUR 14.2 million). This\ndevelopment is mainly due to the year-on-year increase in revenue and the\ncorresponding gross margin and is attributable to the business and cost development\ndescribed above.\nThe result before taxes in H1/2022 was EUR 31.4 million (H1/2021: EUR 4.9 million;\nQ2/2022: EUR 17.2 million; Q1/2022 EUR 14.3 million).\nIn H1/2022, a tax expense of EUR 0.3 million was reported (H1/2021: tax income of EUR\n6.6 million, Q2/2022: tax income of EUR 0.2 million; Q1/2022: tax expense of EUR 0.5\nmillion). This minor tax expense results mainly from the capitalization of deferred taxes\non loss carryforwards in the amount of EUR 3.8 million due to expected future taxable\nprofits.\nThe Company’s net result in H1/2022 amounted to EUR 31.1 million (H1/2021: EUR 11.5\nmillion; Q2/2022: EUR 17.3 million; Q1/2022: EUR 13.8 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of June 30, 2022 or 31 December\n2021.\nTotal equity as of June 30, 2022, increased to EUR 593.6 million compared to EUR 592.2\nmillion as of 31 December 2021. The main influencing factors were the net result and the\ndividend payment of AIXTRON SE. The equity ratio as of June 30, 2022, was 78%\ncompared to 80% as at 31 December 2021.\nCash, cash equivalents and other financial assets, increased to EUR 346.2 million as of\nJune 30, 2022, compared to EUR 352.5 million as of 31 December 2021. The difference is\nmainly due to the dividend payment of EUR 33.7 million, paid in May 2022. Other\nfinancial assets as of June 30, 2022, include fund investments of EUR 200.2 million (31\nDecember 2021: EUR 141.6 million), and short-term bank deposits of EUR 0 million (31\nDecember 2021: EUR 60 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment as of June 30, 2022, increased slightly to EUR 79.2 million\ncompared to 31 December 2021 (31 December 2021: EUR 74.0 million).\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 73.0 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to EUR 72.3\nmillion as of 31 December 2021. No impairment losses were recognized in the first six\nmonths of 2022. The difference is due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components, and work in progress, increased to EUR\n161.6 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to EUR 120.6 million as of 31 December\n2021, indicating the increase in deliveries planned for subsequent quarters.\n14\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nTrade receivables as of June 30, 2022, amounted to EUR 58.3 million (31 December 2021:\nEUR 81.0 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in the second\nquarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The average days sales\noutstanding of receivables was 26 days (31 December 2021: 23 days).\nContract liabilities from advance payments received amounted to EUR 103.7 million as\nof June 30, 2022, compared to EUR 77.0 million as of 31 December 2021, thus reflecting\nthe current order backlog.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities - investments + proceeds from\ndisposals) was EUR 26.4 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: EUR 46.1 million; Q2 2022:\nEUR 4.0 million; Q1 2022: EUR 22.4 million). This development is mainly due to advance\npayments received for customer orders which only partially compensated the\nsimultaneous increase in inventories.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first six months of 2022, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further\nsignificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2021\nAnnual Report. The challenging environment given current global crisis situations and\nmarket developments continue to be assessed as not significant because demand for our\nproducts has not significantly affected and our supply chains, although challenging, are\nconsidered manageable.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the\nchapters “Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2021 which is\npublicly available for download on the Company‘s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\nIn particular, AIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the\nrelevant end user markets could possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term:\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based components for energy-efficient\npower electronics devices in cars, consumer electronics, mobile devices and IT\ninfrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaN-based devices in 5G network infrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based devices in mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) for 5G\nmobile communications or 6E WLAN technology\n15\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• Further increase in demand for lasers for optical data transmission of large volumes,\nsuch as video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing adoption of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensor systems\nin mobile devices as well as sensors for infrastructure applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) for\ndisplays and other applications\n• Commercialization of Micro LED display technology\nMid- to Long-Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated power\nmanagement\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual-light communication\ntechnology or Micro LED displays\n• Increased use of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for autonomous\ndriving\n• Use of GaN-based devices in mobile terminals (e.g., smartphones) for the millimeter-\nwave range of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Increased development activities for high performance solar cells made of\ncompound semiconductor\n16\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the good business development in H1/2022 and in view of the positive\nassessment of the demand development for the remainder of the year 2022, the\nExecutive Board reconfirms its growth guidance.\nAccordingly, for the fiscal year 2022, the Executive Board reiterates its expectations for an\norder intake between EUR 520 million and EUR 580 million. With revenues in a range\nbetween EUR 450 million and EUR 500 million, the Executive Board expects to achieve a\ngross margin of approximately 41% and an EBIT margin of approximately 21% to 23% of\nrevenues for fiscal year 2022.\nAs previously stated, the expectations for 2022 are subject to the assumption that global\ncrises continue to not have a significant impact on the further development of the\nbusiness.\nAlready starting from a very high level, the Executive Board is aiming in the medium term\nfor a slight increase in the proportion of environmentally sustainable Revenues (2021:\n57% of Revenues), Capital Expenditures (2021: 39% of Revenues) and Operating\nExpenditures (2021: 76% of Revenues) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the further development of the global\neconomy and the global trade in order to assess any potential effects on AIXTRON’s own\nsupply chain and production as well as on customer demand and thus on AIXTRON’s\nbusiness development at any time and - if necessary - to initiate appropriate counter\nmeasures.\nFurther details on the annual forecast can be found in the “Expected Developments”\nsection of the Annual Report 2021, which is available on the Company‘s website at\nwww.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n17\nAIXTRON HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT 2022\nINTERIM

This is due to the continued high demand across all end markets, but\nespecially to the growing demand for systems to produce efficient power electronics ba-\nsed on the material systems gallium nitride (GaN) and increasingly silicon carbide (SiC). In\naddition, continued strong demand from the optical data communication and LED display\nsectors ensured full order books. Revenues in Q1/2022 increased year-on-year by 79% to\nEUR 88.6 million (Q1/2021: EUR 49.5 million). Due to the continued high demand, the Exe-\ncutive Board expects significant growth in revenues and order intake with corresponding\nmargins and therefore confirms the growth forecast issued in February.\nAt EUR 130.2 million in Q1/2022, order intake exceeded the value of the strong previous\nquarter (Q4/2021: EUR 119.7 million) and was also higher than in the same quarter of the\nprevious year (Q1/2021: EUR 124.4 million). The development is due to the continued high\ndemand for AIXTRON technologies across all end markets, but in particular to the growing\ndemand for equipment to manufacture efficient power electronics. The equipment order\nbacklog as of March 31, 2022, increased to EUR 260.4 million.\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nAIXTRON GROUP\nCompared to the previous year, revenues in Q1/2022 increased by 79% to EUR 88.6 million\n(Q1/2021: EUR 49.5 million). Gross profit in Q1/2022 doubled to EUR 35.9 million with a\ngross margin of 41% (Q1/2021: EUR 17.3 million; 35%). Operating expenses in Q1/2022 were\nEUR 21.7 million, thus exceeding the corresponding figure of the previous year (Q1/2021:\nEUR 18.0 million), mainly due to higher R&D expenses. With an operating result (EBIT) of\nEUR 14.2 million and an EBIT margin of 16% (Q1/2021: EUR -0.7 million; -1%), the net profit\nmore than tripled in Q1/2022 to EUR 13.8 million (Q1/2021: EUR 3.8 million).\nFree cash flow in Q1/2022 was EUR 22.4 million (Q1/2021: EUR 28.1 million).\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of EUR 374.6 mil-\nlion as of March 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 352.5 million). The increase compared\nto the previous year is mainly due to cash inflows from trade receivables. The equity ratio as\nof March 31, 2022, was 80% (December 31, 2021: 80%).\nThe current global crises continue to have only a minor impact on our business. Logistics and\nsupply chains are tense but remain stable overall in our view.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n(UNAUDITED)\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group (also refer-\nred to as “ AIXTRON” or “the Group”) can be found in the Annual Report 2021. There were\nno changes in the first quarter of 2022.

Compared to the corresponding prior-year figure,\nthe US dollar thus appreciated by 7%, with a corresponding impact on the AIXTRON Group’s\nUS dollar denominated revenues and earnings during the quarter.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues of EUR 88.6 million in Q1/2022 were EUR 39.0 million or 79% higher than the\nprevious year's figure of EUR 49.5 million (Q4/2021: EUR 180.9 million).\nAt EUR 66.3 million, equipment revenues accounted for around 75% of total revenues com-\npared to EUR 38.2 million or 77% in Q1/2021 (Q4/2021: EUR 162.2 million or 90%). The\nremaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\n42% of all equipment revenues were generated in the first quarter with equipment for op-\ntoelectronics applications. The business with equipment for power electronics applications,\nespecially for gallium nitride applications, also contributed a significant 33% of equipment\nrevenues.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n2022 Q1 2021 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 66.3 75 38.2 77 28.2 74\nService, spare parts, etc. 22.3 25 11.4 23 10.9 96\nTotal 88.6 100 49.5 100 39.0 79\nRevenues by Region\n2022 Q1 2021 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 59.6 67 30.9 62 28.7 93\nEurope 19.2 22 15.0 30 4.2 28\nAmericas 9.7 11 3.6 7 6.1 167\nTotal 88.6 100 49.5 100 39.0 79\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n2022 Q1 2021 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR %\nCost of sales 52.7 59 32.2 65 20.4 63\nGross profit 35.9 41 17.3 35 18.6 108\nOperating costs 21.7 24 18.0 36 3.7 21\nSelling expenses 2.6 3 2.2 4 0.4 19\nGeneral and\n6.8 8 5.6 11 1.1 20\nadministration expenses\nResearch and development costs 14.1 16 11.9 24 2.2 19\nNet other operating (income) and\n(1.8) -2 (1.7) -3 0.1 3\nexpenses\nGross profit was EUR 35.9 million in Q1/2022 with a gross margin of 41% (Q1/2021:\nEUR 17.3 million or 35%; Q4/2021: EUR 80.0 million or 44%). The improvement was mainly\ndue to a more favorable US dollar exchange rate for the USD based revenues in Q1 2022 and\nthe expenses incurred in the prior-year quarter for the increase in production capacities.\nOperating expenses of EUR 21.7 million increased by EUR 3.7 million in Q1/2022 compared\nto the same quarter of the previous year (Q1/2021: EUR 18.0 million; Q4/2021: EUR 22.2 mil-\nlion). Contributing to the higher operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 were increa-\nsed R&D expenses as well as increased variable remuneration components. Compared to the\nfourth quarter 2021, operating expenses decreased by EUR 0.5 million, mainly due to lower\nR&D grants being offset by lower R&D expenses.\nR&D expenses in Q1/2022 amounted to EUR 14.1 million (Q1/2021: EUR 11.9 million;\nQ4/2021: EUR 16.3 million). This mainly reflects our ongoing research activities to develop\nnext generation MOCVD equipment for various applications to market readiness.\nKey R&D Information\n2022 Q1 2021 Q1 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 14.1 11.9 19%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 16 24 -8pp\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe net other operating income and expenses resulted in an operating income of\nEUR 1.8 million in Q1/2022 (Q1/2021: EUR 1.7 million; Q4/2021: EUR 4.1 million). This ref-\nlects in particular R&D grants in the amount of EUR 1.7 million.\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved significantly year-on-year from EUR -0.7 million in\nQ1/2021 to EUR 14.2 million in Q1/2022 (Q4/2021: EUR 57.9 million). This development\nresults mainly from the year-on-year increase in revenues and the corresponding increase in\ngross profit, as well as from the cost development described above.\nThe net result of the AIXTRON Group in Q1/2022 amounted to EUR 13.8 million (Q1/2021:\nEUR 3.8 million; Q4/2021: EUR 51.9 million). This includes income from the capitalization of\ndeferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards amounting to EUR 1.2 million (Q1/2021: EUR 4.5 mil-\nlion; Q4/2021: EUR 1.7 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets (Highlights)\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of March 31, 2022, or December 31,\n2021.\nTotal equity increased from EUR 592.2 million as of December 31, 2021, to EUR 607.5 mil-\nlion as of March 31, 2022, mainly due to the net income generated in the reporting period.\nThe equity ratio as of March 31, 2022, was stable at 80% compared to 80% as of December\n31, 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets increased to EUR 374.6 million as of March\n31, 2022, compared to EUR 352.5 million as of December 31, 2021, the difference being\nmainly due to cash inflows from trade receivables in the reporting period. Other financial\nassets as of March 31, 2022, include fund investments of EUR 140.6 million (December 31,\n2021: EUR 141.6 million) and short-term bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million (December 31,\n2021: EUR 60.0 million).\nProperty, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2022, increased to EUR 77.3 million com-\npared to December 31, 2021 (EUR 74.0 million as of December 31,2021), due to increased\ninvestments, in particular in laboratory plant and equipment.\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 72.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to EUR 72.3 mil-\nlion as of December 31, 2021. There were no impairments in the first three months of 2022.\nThe difference is due to exchange rate fluctuations.\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInventories, including raw materials, components and work in progress, increased to\nEUR 143.5 million as of March 31, 2022, compared to EUR 120.6 million as of December 31,\n2021, indicating an increase in planned shipments in subsequent quarters.\nTrade receivables as of March 31, 2022, amounted to EUR 49.9 million (December 31, 2021:\nEUR 81.0 million), mainly reflecting the current business volume. The receivables correspon-\nded to days sales outstanding of 39 days (December 31, 2021: 23 days).\nAdvance payments received from customers amounted to EUR 81.4 million as of March 31,\n2022, compared to EUR 77.0 million as of December 31, 2021, thus reflecting the current\norder backlog.\nCash flow\nMainly due to the positive result and cash inflows from trade receivables, free cash flow\n(cash flow from operating activities, adjusted for changes in fund investments, less invest-\nments plus proceeds from disposals) amounted to EUR 22.4 million in Q1/2022 (Q1/2021:\nEUR 28.1 million; Q4/2021: EUR 21.6 million).\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first three months of 2022, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further\nsignificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2021 An-\nnual Report. The risks arising from the current global crises continue to be assessed as not\nsignificant because it became apparent that demand for our products has not been significantly\naffected and our supply chains, although strained, are nevertheless functioning reliably.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2021 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company’s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the good business development in the first quarter and in view of the positive\nassessment of the development of demand for the fiscal year 2022, the Executive Board\nconfirms the growth forecast issued.\nAccordingly, for the fiscal year 2022, the Executive Board expects order intake in a range bet-\nween EUR 520 million and EUR 580 million. With revenues in a range between EUR 450 mil-\nlion and EUR 500 million, the Executive Board expects to achieve a gross margin of appro-\nximately 41% and an EBIT margin of approximately 21% to 23% of revenues in the fiscal\nyear 2022. The expectations for 2022 are subject to global crises still not having a significant\nimpact on the development of the business.\nIn addition, with a view to the sustainability targets, the Executive Board is aiming in the me-\ndium term for a slight increase in the share of environmentally sustainable revenues (2021:\n57% of revenues), capital expenditures (CapEx; 2021: 39% of revenues) and operating expen-\nses (OpEx; 2021: 76% of revenues) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nFurther details on the annual forecast can be found in the \"Expected Developments\"\nsection of the Annual Report 2021, which is available on the Company's website at\nhttps://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2022\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT

The Company has subsidiaries in Asia, the United States, and in Europe.\nThe Company’s technology solutions are used by a broad range of customers worldwide for\nthe manufacture of high-performance and optoelectronic applications based on compound\nsemiconductors. These devices are used in a variety of innovative applications, technologies\nand industries. These include laser, LED, display technologies, optical and wireless data trans-\nmission, SiC and GaN power electronics, and many other leading-edge applications.\nOur registered trademarks: AIXACT(R), AIXTRON(R), APEVA(R); Close Coupled Shower-\nhead(R), EXP(R), EPISON(R), Gas Foil Rotation(R), OptacapTM, OVPD(R), Planetary Reactor(R),\nPVPD(R), STExS(R), TriJet(R)\nFor further information on AIXTRON (FSE: AIXA, ISIN DE000A0WMPJ6) please visit our web-\nsite at: www.aixtron.com\n5\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nLetter to Shareholders\nDear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe fiscal year 2021 was exceptionally successful for AIXTRON with order intake growing to\nEUR 497 million (+65%), revenues to EUR 429 million (+59%), and operating income to EUR\n99 million (+184%) - the latter roughly tripling. Our growth is driven by a broad base of appli-\ncation segments, and is built on the global megatrends of sustainability, electrification and\ndigitalization. 2021 also shows that our compound semiconductor equipment business is on\ntrack to move towards the large volume markets of the semiconductor industry. Compound\nsemiconductors are a key technology for numerous technology fields, as they are superior to\nclassic semiconductors based on silicon in many areas – this is driving our growth!\nPower electronics and optoelectronics are the major trends in microelectronics driving\ngrowth for compound semiconductors.\nPower electronics are required where currents and voltages are converted, e. g. in the char-\nging and discharging of batteries and electric vehicles. These processes should happen with\nvirtually no losses so that electrical energy can be used as efficiently as possible. This is whe-\nre compound semiconductors are far superior to the silicon semiconductors used to date.\nAIXTRON’s innovative solutions play a key role in sustainabilty. They facilitate superior energy\nefficiency, lay the foundations for electromobility, and thus make a decisive contribution to\nclimate protection. In particular, the market for gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors\nhas seen rapid growth in the year 2021, following their commercial breakthrough. With our\ntechnology, our customers are increasingly tapping into further segments of the with our\ntechnology. This applies not only to the field of compact smartphone chargers, but also in-\ncreasingly to highly efficient power supply of data centers and IT infrastructure, as well as\nsolar energy. At the same time, our customer base is steadily broadening, providing the basis\nfor further growth. We also made great progress in the market for silicon carbide (SiC) power\nsemiconductors during 2021. We are winning additional market share with well-known new\ncustomers, and we are growing with our major existing customers as they build further ma-\nnufacturing capacity. And we are receiving very positive feedback from our target customers\non our technology and product strategy.\nIn optoelectronics, the focus is on optical applications ranging from lasers for fast data trans-\nmission or for the environment scanner in autonomous driving to innovative displays. Our\nsolutions are a key element in the ongoing digitalization of our world. Rapidly growing data\nvolumes and the desire for ever faster data availability are the driving forces behind ever\nmore powerful optical and mobile transmission networks. In addition, more and more ve-\nhicles are being equipped with laser-based sensor technology (LiDAR) to increase safety and\nfacilitate autonomous driving. We are also seeing further growth in the field of red LEDs,\nwhere our customers are continuing to expand their capacities to meet the growing demand\nfor LED displays and LED lighting in the field of indoor farming (agriculture). In addition, AIX-\n6\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nTRON is excellently positioned for the next generation of displays, made of Micro LEDs. We\nare working with numerous customers to develop this new technology, with the aim of soon\nbecoming a market leader in the upcoming commercialization.\nThe decisive factor in all these trends is that compound semiconductors play a key role and\nAIXTRON is actively spearheading this development as a technology and market leader. As\na result, we are benefiting directly from the rapidly increasing demand that is driving our\ngrowth - both today and in the future.\nIn our core business of technologies for compound semiconductors, we continue to invest\nsignificantly in research and development to completely renew our equipment portfolio. Pro-\ntotypes of next-generation tools are already being tested by individual customers and are\nachieving very good results which often also results in follow-up orders. Through significant\ndifferentiation, we will maintain our strong market position in the future - and expand it even\nfurther in some segments.\nOur OLED subsidiary APEVA was initially restructured in the second quarter of 2021 and fo-\ncused on the Chinese market. However, as customers in this market are also opting for Micro\nLED as the technological basis for the development of the next generation of displays even\nfaster than originally expected, the shareholders of APEVA have decided not to invest further\nand to wind up the APEVA Group.\nOur Executive Board Members Dr. Jochen Linck, Dr. Felix Grawert und Dr. Christian Danninger (from left to right).\n7\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nParticularly noteworthy for fiscal year 2021 is the robustness of our supply chain. This has\nenabled us to grow revenues by 59% despite the tense conditions in global supply chains.\nWe were able to meet customer demand and at EUR 181 million in the fourth quarter, we\nrecorded the highest quarterly shipments in 10 years. This shows that our manufacturing and\nsupply chain are well equipped for further growth in the coming years.\nTo be prepared for further growth in the future, we are also working intensively on the struc-\ntural enhancement of AIXTRON. The generational change AIXTRON's Executive Board was\ncompleted with the entry of our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Christian Danninger, on May 1,\n2021, and the retirement of Dr. Bernd Schulte on April 01, 2021. In the new formation with\nthree Executive Board members, each dedicated to a major area of responsibility, we are\nnow well positioned to successfully implement our growth strategy in the coming years. We\nare also working in a targeted manner on streamlining and digitalizing our business proces-\nses. We are also adapting our corporate structures to facilitate further rapid growth and\nmeet the increasing demands of our customers in terms of product quality and innovation.\nAt the same time, we are already intensively working on the technologies of tomorrow and\nbeyond in order to secure a pole position in newly emerging markets.\nTo make this a sustainable path into the future, we have expanded our activities in the area\nof sustainability & ESG (environment, social, governance). For example, we are already vo-\nluntarily reporting for fiscal year 2021 on the taxonomy alignment of our business activities\nin accordance with the new EU Taxonomy Regulation. We achieved very good results in this\nprocess, which clearly underlines the sustainability of our business activities. In addition,\npositive ESG ratings from various rating agencies show that AIXTRON has a strong focus on\nthis issue and plays an essential role on the way to climate neutrality.\nHaving had a great year in 2021, in which we grew strongly despite numerous challenges,\nthe outlook for the current fiscal year is again very good, so we also remain optimistic about\nthe future.\n8\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nOur employees are the key to our company's success. Their creativity and problem-solving\nskills, their commitment and the extraordinary dedication of our teams are the foundation\nof AIXTRON. This also reflects our strong, AIXTRON-specific corporate culture, which we will\ncontinue to develop carefully and with a great sense of responsibility. Our special thanks go\nto all our colleagues for this commitment!\nOur suppliers and business partners were also crucial to our success in 2021. Despite strai-\nned global supply chains, they helped AIXTRON achieve a record year and put in a great deal\nof effort to make it happen. Our thanks also go to them.\nA big thank you also goes to our Supervisory Board for their trusting cooperation in all mat-\nters of strategy and corporate development.\nAlso, we would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in us to lead AIXTRON\nsustainably and profitably into a future of continued strong growth.\nDr. Felix Grawert Dr. Christian Danninger Dr. Jochen Linck\n9\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nSupervisory Board Report\nIn fiscal year 2021, AIXTRON generated the highest order intake and revenues since 2012.\nThis is the result of a consistent focus on applications of compound semiconductor materials\nin fast growing end markets, which we have been pursuing in a targeted manner for several\nyears. The outstanding commitment of AIXTRON’s employees has made this performance\npossible, despite a challenging business environment in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAIXTRON provides key technology for the megatrends of sustainability and digitalization,\nwhich offer exceptionally attractive growth opportunities. With respect to sustainability,\nAIXTRON’s innovative power electronics solutions are making a significant contribution to\nclimate protection and energy efficiency, as well as to the expansion of electromobility and\nrenewable energies. Compound semiconductors manufactured on AIXTRON equipment are\ncore components of electric vehicles, highly efficient data centers, and in the area of pow-\ner generation from renewable sources. The rapidly advancing digitalization is enabled by\nAIXTRON’s solutions in optoelectronics. Here, the focus is on the expansion of optical data\ntransmission networks, high-speed mobile networks, and environment detection through\noptical sensors. In addition, Micro LEDs will form the backbone for the next generation of\ndisplays, whether in wearables, smartphones, in TV sets or in AR/VR glasses. All of these ap-\nplications will be unlocked by technologies manufactured on AIXTRON equipment. AIXTRON\nhas established an outstanding global market position in these markets through targeted\ninvestments in research and development and will consistently exploit the resulting business\nopportunities in the coming years.\nThe new appointments to the Executive Board, as resolved by the Supervisory Board in 2019,\nwere successfully completed in 2021. Dr. Bernd Schulte retired on April 1, 2021, after nine-\nteen successful years on the Executive Board. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) position was\nappointed with Dr. Christian Danninger as of May 1, 2021. Since then, the Executive Board\nhas consisted of a total of three members. In addition to Dr. Felix Grawert, who was appoin-\nted Chairman of the Executive Board on April 1, 2021, these are Dr. Joachim Linck, Chief Ope-\nrating Officer (COO), and Dr. Christian Danninger, Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Due to the\ncomplementary competence profiles and backgrounds of experience, the Executive Board is\nnow best positioned to seize the growth opportunities in the coming years.\nTraining or professional development measures for members of the Supervisory Board are\nappropriately supported by the Company.\nThe growing importance of sustainability in Group management was taken into account in\n2021 by creating a new staff function ESG & Sustainability Management, reporting directly\nto the Executive Board. As a climate-neutral Company, AIXTRON is also striving to play a pio-\nneering role in this area and is already reporting voluntarily on its EU Taxonomy aligned re-\nvenues, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) for fiscal year 2021. The\nresults impressively reflect the decisive contribution AIXTRON is making with its technologies\nto reducing the global CO footprint and thus to reducing global warming.\n2\n10\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe Supervisory Board has prepared for the upcoming change of auditor and has decided\nto propose to the Annual General Meeting the election of KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungs-\ngesellschaft as auditor for the Company’s annual and consolidated financial statements for\nthe 2022 financial year.\nThroughout the reporting year, the Supervisory Board performed the duties and responsibi-\nlities entrusted to it by law, the Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure without\nlimitation.\nCooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored the Executive Board in its management of\nthe Company and advised it on all matters of importance to the Company, so that the Super-\nvisory Board was always able to verify the legality and regularity, expediency, and economic\nefficiency of the Company’s management.\nThe Supervisory Board was directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental\nimportance to the Company.

The Supervisory Board was updated on the strategy and development\nplanning in the optoelectronics technology segment. The industry dynamics in the laser\nand LED segments were presented in detail and a comprehensive overview of the current\ndevelopment in the future segment Micro LED was given. In addition, the Executive Board\nprovided information on the status of various strategy projects and gave an update on the\nrestructuring of the APEVA companies.\nOn December 15, 2021, the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE held its last ordinary mee-\nting of the year. The budget for 2022 presented by the Executive Board was discussed in\ndetail and approved. The 2022 budget includes, among other things, the detailed revenue,\nearnings, financial and investment planning as well as the planned personnel development\nof the AIXTRON Group. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board discussed the agenda for the\nnext Annual General Meeting on May 25, 2022. As in the previous year, this Annual General\nMeeting is to be held virtually. As part of the annual efficiency review, the Supervisory Bo-\nard's activities were assessed using a comprehensive questionnaire and specific areas were\nidentified where work can be done even more effectively.\n13\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nCommittees\nThe Supervisory Board has formed four committees: an Audit Committee, a Capital Markets\nCommittee, a Nomination Committee, and a Remuneration Committee. The committees pre-\npare resolutions and issues to be dealt with in the plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board.\nThe Audit Committee deals with the monitoring of accounting, the accounting process, cor-\nporate governance & compliance, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk\nmanagement system, the internal audit system, the audit of the financial statements as well\nas assessing the quality of the audit. The Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Anna\nWeber, has expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing (Section 107 (4), Section 100 (5)\nof the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)) as well as special knowledge and experience in\nthe application of internal control procedures.\nIn the year under review, the Supervisory Board commissioned Deloitte GmbH Wirtschafts-\nprüfungsgesellschaft, as proposed by the Audit Committee, with the audit of the annual and\nconsolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report of AIXTRON\nSE as of December 31, 2021, the audit of the Company's early risk detection system within\nthe meaning of Section 91 (2) AktG, the preparation of a \"Management Letter\", the findings\npursuant to Section 7.2.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code and, pursuant to 111\n(2) AktG, with the content review of the separate Group non-financial report to be prepared\nfor 2021. In addition, the key audit matters (KAM) to be mentioned in the auditor's report on\nthe AIXTRON Annual and Consolidated Financial Statements 2021 were discussed with the\nauditor.\nThe Audit Committee met eight times in 2021 (February 22, February 23, May 18, June 8,\nSeptember 21, September 29, November 10, December 14). The significantly higher number\nof meetings compared to the previous year is due to the complex tendering process of the\naudit for fiscal year 2022. All members of the Audit Committee attended the meetings in\nperson or by video link. All resolutions were passed unanimously. For the quarterly financial\nstatements as of March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021, the Audit Com-\nmittee held discussions with the auditors and accounting representatives in each case and\ndiscussed the publication of the quarterly figures in detail with the Executive Board.\n14\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nIn addition to the above-mentioned tasks and the quarterly accounting issues, the Audit\nCommittee dealt with the following special topics, among others:\n• Declaration of independence and ongoing monitoring of the auditor's independence\n• Tender for the audit of the financial statements for fiscal year 2022\n• Non-financial Group report (Sustainability Report), in particular implementation of the\nrequirements of the EU Taxonomy Directive\n• Implementation of the requirements under the Financial Market Integrity\nStrengthening Act (Finanzmarktintegritätsstärkungsgesetz - FISG)\n• Risk management, in particular implementation of the requirements from the new\nversion of the auditing standard IDW PS 340 revised\n• Internal (accounting-related) control system\n• Internal audits 2021 and audit plan for the following year\n• Compliance, esp. compliance training plan for 2021\n• Information security, esp. focus topics in 2021\n• Tax audits, esp. at AIXTRON SE\n• Assessment of the quality of the audit of the financial statements\nThe Capital Market Committee is concerned with the evaluation of activities with potential\ncapital market relevance. It consists of two members. No meetings were held in 2021.\nThe Nomination Committee consists of three members and makes appropriate proposals\nto the full Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to the corporate bodies. In\ndoing so, it also considers the targets for the composition of the corporate bodies.\nIn 2021, the Nomination Committee met three times, on September 21, October 19 and\nNovember 5. These meetings, the majority of which were held by telephone, were attended\nby all members of the Nomination Committee and invited guests. At the meeting of the\nNomination Committee held on September 21, 2021, Mr. van Hout was elected Chairman.\nThe meetings dealt primarily with issues relating to the appointment of Supervisory Board\nmembers at the 2022 Annual General Meeting.\nIn the past fiscal year, issues relating to the Remuneration Committee were dealt with at the\nmeetings of the Nomination Committee, as the members of both committees are identical.\nThe Remuneration Committee dealt mainly with issues relating to the remuneration of the\nmembers of the Executive Board, in particular its variable short- and long-term remuneration\ncomponents.\n15\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nCorporate Governance and Declaration of Conformity\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitors the development of corporate governance\nstandards and prepares a joint corporate governance report together with the Executive\nBoard. The Supervisory Board will continue to support the Executive Board in its efforts to\nfully comply with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\nIn the current Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Cor-\nporation Act (AktG) dated February 2022, full compliance with the recommendations of the\nGerman Corporate Governance Code is declared, except for the deviation explained.\nNo conflicts of interest involving members of the Supervisory Board or Executive Board were\nreported in the fiscal year.\nAudit and Annual Financial Statements\nPursuant to the resolution of the general shareholders meeting on May 19, 2021, the Su-\npervisory Board commissioned Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf,\nwith the audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements\nas well as the combined management report of AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2021.\nThe audits also covered the measures taken by the Executive Board to identify risks at an\nearly stage that could jeopardize the success and continued existence of the Company, as\nwell as the lawful, proper, and appropriate reporting of non-financial information in the Sus-\ntainability Report for 2021. It was also agreed that the auditor must inform the Supervisory\nBoard or make a note in the audit report if, during the performance of the audit, it ascertains\nfacts that show a misstatement in the Declaration of Conformity issued by the Executive\nBoard and Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corpora-\ntion Act (AktG). As in previous years, such a determination was not necessary for the 2021\nfiscal year.\nThe annual financial statements and the combined management report of AIXTRON SE and\nthe AIXTRON Group as of December 31, 2021, were prepared in accordance with the rules\nof the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements and the group\nmanagement report as of December 31, 2021, were prepared in accordance with Section\n315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS. The indepen-\ndent auditing Company Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft audited both the an-\nnual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements and combined manage-\nment report prepared by AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2021 and reviewed the separate Group\nnon-financial report. The financial statements including the combined management report\nwere issued with an unqualified audit opinion. The non-financial consolidated report recei-\nved the opinion of an audit to obtain limited assurance. The auditors found that the com-\nbined management report of the Company and the Group accurately presents the current\n16\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nbusiness and future development of the Company and the Group. The audit of the financial\nstatements of AIXTRON SE in fiscal year 2021 by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-\nschaft was performed by the audit team with the lead auditor Mr. André Bedenbecker.\nThe financial statement documents (annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE and consoli-\ndated financial statements as of December 31, 2021, as well as the combined management\nreport of AIXTRON SE and the Group), the separate Group non-financial report as well as the\nauditor's reports were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a\ntimely manner. These documents were reviewed in detail by us. In the meeting of the Audit\nCommittee and the full Supervisory Board on February 23, 2022, both the annual financial\nstatements of AIXTRON SE and the consolidated financial statements as well as the combi-\nned management report and the Group non-financial report were discussed and debated in\ndetail, considering the audit reports of the auditor. The auditor, who attended both the Audit\nCommittee meeting and the Supervisory Board meeting, reported on the main results of its\naudit, which also included the internal control and risk management system regarding the\naccounting process, and was available to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board,\nrespectively, for any additional questions and information.\nThe results of our own review did not give rise to any objections either to the Group non-fi-\nnancial report or to the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements\nand the combined management report. The combined management report is consistent\nwith our own assessment of the situation of the Company and the Group. We concurred\nwith the auditor's findings, with which we fully agreed in terms of content and approved the\nannual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the combi-\nned management report prepared by the Executive Board, as well as the Group non-financial\nreport of the Company for fiscal year 2021, by resolution dated February 23, 2022. The an-\nnual financial statements of AIXTRON SE were thus formally adopted.\n17\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nNote of thanks from the Supervisory Board\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Executive\nBoard and all employees of the AIXTRON Group for their extraordinary dedication and hard\nwork in fiscal year 2021, which was characterized by immense growth of the Company\nand dealing with the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The entire Supervisory\nBoard would also like to thank the employee representatives for their constructive coopera-\ntion with the Company's executive bodies in this successful and challenging year.\nHerzogenrath, February 2022\nKim Schindelhauer\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n18\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nThe AIXTRON share is listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and is\nincluded in the two benchmark indices MDAX and TecDAX of Deutsche Börse AG. According\nto the index ranking of Deutsche Börse in terms of market capitalization as of December 31,\n2021, the AIXTRON share is ranked 42nd in the MDAX, which now comprises 50 stocks since\nthe index reform in September (December 2020: 57th place among 60 stocks). As the trans-\naction volume is no longer a relevant criterion since the index reform, no ranking is calcula-\nted for it anymore. Among the 30 TecDAX members, AIXTRON’s shares ranked 17th (2020:\n22nd) in terms of market capitalization for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn addition to traditional trading venues such as XETRA and the German regional stock ex-\nchanges, AIXTRON shares are also traded to a not inconsiderable extent on alternative tra-\nding platforms such as Tradegate, Quotrix and Chi-X Europe.\nAIXTRON Share Price Development and Trading Volumes during 2021\nAIXTRON TecDAX SDAX MDAX\nAIXTRON share in € January 4, 2021 = 100%\n27.23 190\n25.79 180\n24.36 170\n22.93 160\n21.50 150\n20.06 140\n18.63 130\n17.20 120\n15.76 110\n14.33 100\n12.90 90\n11.46 80\nJan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 Dec 21\nVolume Quotes increased Quotes decreased\nShares\n4.29M\n2.86M\n1.43M\n0\nJan 21 Feb 21 Mar 21 Apr 21 May 21 Jun 21 Jul 21 Aug 21 Sep 21 Oct 21 Nov 21 Dec 21\n19\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nAIXTRON Share: High Volatility and Significant Gains\nThe trading year 2021 was strongly characterized by the further evolution of the COVID-19\npandemic, relief about the available vaccines and the recovery of the global economy from\nthe strong recession of the previous year. Accordingly, the upswing in share prices on the\nglobal stock markets continued in the first half of 2021. Due to increasing concerns about\ninflation, interest rates and pandemic-related disruptions in supply chains, material shor-\ntages and sharply rising commodity prices, the stock market environment deteriorated in\nthe beginning of the second half of the year, so that some of the gains were lost again by the\nfirst weeks of October. An encouraging reporting season, growing clarity about the further\nmonetary policy course of important central banks and hopes for a strong economy in 2022\nthen provided new impetus for share prices. This was interrupted by the emergence of the\nfast spreading Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus in November. Reports of an often less\nsevere course of the Omicron disease and thus the prospect of a lower economic burden\ncaused the stock markets to rise again by the end of the year. In total, despite all the uncer-\ntainties, the stock market year 2021 was quite pleasing on many stock exchanges, with some\nsignificant price gains.\nSupported by the increasing return to economic normality and by fiscal policy measures, Ger-\nmany’s leading index DAX and the more cyclical sectors within it, initially performed much\nmore stable than the highly valued, more interest-sensitive technology stocks. By contrast,\nboth the enlargement of the DAX and the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) election\nhad only a minor impact on German equities. In the second half of the year, inflation and\nsupply bottlenecks weighed only temporarily on share prices in Germany, too, so that an\noptimistic underlying mood prevailed here at the end of the year. The DAX therefore ended\nthe year at 15,885 points, up 15.8%. Despite the implemented reforms, the DAX is still signifi-\ncantly dominated by cyclical stocks. In contrast, the MDAX, which also includes the AIXTRON\nshare, is much more heavily populated with technology stocks. The clearly different develop-\nment of cyclical stocks and technology stocks was accordingly also reflected in the MDAX.\nUnder the impression of sharply rising bond yields, which particularly affected technology\nstocks, a large performance gap opened up between the DAX and the MDAX until mid-May.\nHowever, with increasing clarity about the future interest rate policy, the MDAX subsequent-\nly closed this gap in the further course of the year. Particularly in the second half of the\nyear, stock market performance was strongly driven by technology stocks. Overall, the index\nslightly underperformed the DAX with a gain of 14.1%. The TecDAX, almost half of which is\nmade up of MDAX stocks, showed a very similar development. The pure technology focus of\nthe index caused even greater fluctuations than in the more traditional indices. Supported by\nthe general strength of technology stocks at the end of the year, the TecDAX thus significantly\noutperformed the DAX and MDAX with a full-year gain of 22.0%.\n20\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nThe AIXTRON share benefited from a very successful business performance and outperfor-\nmed the market as a whole in the generally positive market environment at the beginning of\nthe year, but was repeatedly affected by a downward pull of volatile technology stocks. Due\nto the high valuation levels reached in the meantime, technology stocks in particular reacted\nhighly sensitive to the development of the pandemic, the inflation as well as interest rate\nhikes becoming increasingly likely. The AIXTRON share was not immune to this development\nand thus lost a large part of its initial price gains.\nAfter a slow start to the new trading year, which also included the year low of EUR 14.27 on\nJanuary 7, the share benefited from strong results of the semiconductor industry as well as\nfrom positive analyst comments, which stated that massive investments in MOCVD equip-\nment were imminent. Thus, the AIXTRON share reached a first interim high in mid-February.\nThe full year 2020 figures and a strong outlook for 2021 also gave the share further impetus.\nRenewed pandemic concerns due to the increasing spread of the Delta variant temporarily\nimpacted the share price in March. However, on April 1, it reached an interim high of EUR\n19.72, already up 38% after the first quarter.\nFollowing a consolidation phase, the results for the first quarter of 2021 caused the share to\nfall significantly at the end of April. Market participants pointed out that the first quarter had\nnot been satisfactory, as the market was expecting higher results. In addition, the setback in\nthe OLED project of the subsidiary APEVA had caused disappointment. The share fell back to\nEUR 15.13 by May 12 but started a slight recovery in the run-up to the annual general mee-\nting, which decided to distribute a dividend again for the first time in several years. The share\nreceived a significant boost on June 9 from a raised guidance as a result of stronger customer\ndemand. Within two days, the share gained more than 25% and reached a new interim high\nof EUR 23.37 on June 29.\nAfter a further consolidation phase in an unsteady market environment in July, where even\nthe expected good half-year figures did not have a large price effect, the share resumed its\n21\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nupward trend in August. Persistently strong chip demand underlined the need for capacity\nexpansion and thus the positive environment also for demand of AIXTRON equipment. As\na result, the share price reached its year high of EUR 26.06 on August 30, up more than\n80% year-on-year. Nevertheless, the AIXTRON share was affected by the weaker overall mar-\nket and the deteriorating environment in particular for technology stocks. Investors realized\nsome of their gains, causing the share price to fall back towards EUR 20.00.\nAt the beginning of the fourth quarter, the share price initially moved in a range between EUR\n20 and 22. Even the once again strong quarterly figures did not provide impetus for the share\nprice on November 4. Instead, investors were concerned about a possible slowdown of cus-\ntomer demand momentum in 2022, causing the share to fall by as much as 5%. In addition\nto the general downward trend caused by rapidly rising COVID-19 infections, concerns about\ninflation, and a sector rotation from technology stocks to value stocks, renewed concerns ab-\nout weakening demand in AIXTRON’s core markets resulted in further significant share price\ndeclines on November 24, bringing the share price down to EUR 16.34 by mid-December.\nWith positive news from the semiconductor industry, sentiment then changed again, resul-\nting in a recovery of the share price to some extent by the end of the year.\nThe AIXTRON share ended the trading year 2021 on December 30 with a gain of 25% at a\nprice of EUR 17.87, corresponding to a market capitalization of EUR 2,024.5 million. The\nbenchmark indices MDAX and TecDAX increased by 14% from 30,796 points to 35,123 points\nand by 22% from 3,213 points to 3,920 points, respectively, in the course of 2021.\n22\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nBroadly Diversified Shareholder Structure\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 22% of AIXTRON shares were held by private in-\ndividuals (2020: 20%), most of whom are domiciled in Germany.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of roadshows and conferences\nin 2021 were again held exclusively virtually or in hybrid form.\nThe ongoing pandemic-related shift of investor relations activities to virtual platforms did not\naffect AIXTRON's intensively cultivated dialogue with the international financial community.\nIn fact, even more virtual investor and analyst meetings were held in 2021 than in the pre-\nvious year. The AIXTRON Executive Board and Investor Relations team communicated with\na total of over 530 financial market participants worldwide in fiscal year 2021. More than\n250 investor and analyst meetings took place in the form of video or telephone conferences,\ntelephone calls, as well as occasional physical meetings.\nDue to the continuing contact restrictions in 2021 to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nGeneral Meeting of AIXTRON SE was again held in a purely virtual form on May 19, 2021.\nThe Annual General Meeting, which was streamed completely live on the internet for share-\nholders, was followed online by more than 500 shareholders and interested persons. 63% of\nthe share capital was represented.

Any reports or indication\nreceived will be treated discreetly, confidentially and anonymously by the persons / bodies\ninvolved. AIXTRON will not impose any reprisals against employees who report violations.\nFurthermore, AIXTRON has established a Vendor Code of Conduct, which defines ethical,\nmoral and legal standards related to the purchase and use of what are known as conflict\nminerals (gold, tantalum, tungsten, tin) within the AIXTRON supply chain. The key content of\nthis code includes information on U.S. rules regarding the use of conflict minerals, the expec-\ntations placed on suppliers and the consequences in the event of non-compliance.\nThe Vendor Code of Conduct is summarized in the Supplier Manual, which can be found on\nthe AIXTRON website under the menu item Company / Suppliers in the Supplier Manage-\nment section.\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board Operating Procedures as well\nas Composition and Mode of Operation of Committees\nAIXTRON SE is a European stock company (Societas Europaea) and is subject not only to the\nGerman stock corporation law but also to the superordinate European SE regulations and the\nGerman SE Implementation Act. The Company has a dual management and control structure\nconsisting of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board.\nThe Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company and informs the Supervisory\nBoard regularly, comprehensively and without delay about all relevant issues involving stra-\ntegy, planning, business development, the risk situation, risk management and compliance.\nThe Supervisory Board appoints the Executive Board members and oversees and advises the\nExecutive Board in its management duties. To perform certain transactions and measures\nspecified by law, in the Articles of Association of AIXTRON SE or the Executive Board’s by-\nlaws, the Executive Board must obtain the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. The Exe-\ncutive Board is required to report to the Supervisory Board on the conclusion, amendment\nor termination of important agreements that do not require approval under the Articles of\nAssociation or the Executive Board’s by-laws. The Executive Board is also required to notify\nthe Supervisory Board of all material events, even those that do not require the approval of\nthe Supervisory Board.\n29\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board worked closely together\nthroughout 2021 for the benefit of the Company. The shared objective is to secure and ex-\npand AIXTRON’s leading market positions in the long term in order to benefit from growing\nend markets.\nNo committees have been set up by AIXTRON SE’s Executive Board.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has established four committees, an Audit Committee,\na Capital Market Committee, a Nomination Committee, and a Remuneration Committee. The\nSupervisory Board is authorized to establish additional committees from among its members.\nThe Audit Committee consists of a Chairwoman and two other members. As an independent\nmember, the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Anna Weber, has expertise in the\nareas of accounting and auditing (Section 107 para. 4, Section 100 para. 5 AktG) and special\nknowledge and experience in the application of internal control procedures. The members\nare also familiar in their entirety with the sector in which AIXTRON is represented, which is\npartially due to their many years of experience. The Audit Committee deals in particular with\nthe audit of the accounting, the monitoring of the accounting process, corporate governance\n& compliance, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system,\nthe internal audit system. The Audit Committee also deals with the audit of the financial\nstatements, the assessment of the quality of the audit, and the review of the sustainability\nreport to be prepared by the Company. Furthermore, the Audit Committee submits to the\nfull Supervisory Board a reasoned recommendation for the appointment of the auditor. This\nwas done in November 2021 after the audit mandate for 2022 was retendered and a com-\nprehensive selection process was conducted. The Audit Committee monitors the necessary\nindependence of the auditor and the additional services provided by the auditor. Finally, it\ndeals with the issuing of the audit mandate to the auditor, the determination of auditing fo-\ncal points and the fee agreement. The committee chairwoman, Prof. Dr. Anna Weber, reports\nregularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the Audit Committee.\nFor the purpose of evaluating, supporting and implementing projects with capital market\nrelevance, a Capital Market Committee has existed since 2014, consisting of two members,\nthe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and another member of the Supervisory Board.\nThe Nomination Committee, which consists of three members of the Supervisory Board,\nmakes election proposals to the full Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to\nexecutive bodies and discusses issues relating to the replacement of members of the Super-\nvisory Board.\nIn addition, a Remuneration Committee has been established, consisting of the same mem-\nbers as the Nomination Committee. This committee deals with the application of the com-\npensation system in accordance with the DCGK.\n30\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFurther details on the work of the Executive Board, Supervisory Board and committees du-\nring fiscal year 2021 can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board, which is part of\nthe Annual Report and can be downloaded from the AIXTRON website.

The Supervisory Board appoin-\nted Dr. Christian Danninger as a new member of the Executive Board in the function of Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO) effective May 1, 2021. The appointment was made for three years.\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board appointed Executive Board member Dr. Felix Grawert as\nChairman of the Executive Board effective April 1, 2021.\n31\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nNotwithstanding the Executive Board’s overall legal responsibility and the obligation of the\nExecutive Board members to collaborate closely and in confidence with their colleagues, the\nassigned responsibilities of the individual members of the Executive Board are as follows in\naccordance with the currently valid business distribution plan as of December 15, 2021:\nThe Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr. Grawert, coordinates the work of the Executive\nBoard and is also responsible for Strategic Planning, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and\nInnovation within the AIXTRON Group.\nExecutive Board member Dr. Danninger is responsible for the Group's Finance and Repor-\nting, Human Resources, Investor Relations & Communications, ESG (Environment, Social and\nGovernance), Corporate Governance, Compliance & Risk Management, and Information Se-\ncurity and Legal departments.\nThe Executive Board member Dr. Linck has Group-wide responsibility for Procurement, Pro-\nduct Cost Management, Manufacturing and Logistics, Quality Management, IT, Facility Ma-\nnagement, and Research and Development.\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board has adopted Rules of Pro-\ncedure which are regularly reviewed for their appropriateness and topicality. Among other\nthings, they contain a list of matters of fundamental or significant importance on which the\nExecutive Board must formally resolve. This concerns, for example, decisions on: the Com-\npany‘s strategies, business plans and budgets; material changes to the Company and Group\norganization; the commencement or cessation of the Company‘s activities; the acquisition\nand sale of land or land rights; the conclusion, amendment and termination of corporate or\nsignificant license agreements; the award of major external consulting and research con-\ntracts; fundamental issues relating to human resources and personnel policy; determining\nthe principles for representation in business organizations and associations; appointments\nto the management and supervisory bodies of subsidiaries and associated companies; im-\nportant publications and information to the public outside the regular publicity; initiating\nlawsuits and legal disputes; providing collateral and assuming guarantees.\nThe Rules of Procedure for the Executive Board and the Articles of Association each contain\na catalog of significant transactions and measures that additionally require the prior appro-\nval of the Supervisory Board. The transactions and measures requiring approval under the\nArticles of Association or the Rules of Procedure include, for example, decisions on the esta-\nblishment or sale of business premises, the acquisition or sale of land, the commencement\nor discontinuation of business activities or the granting or taking out of loans.\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure, meetings of the Executive Board take place at\nleast twice a month and when the well-being of the Company so requires. Meetings of the\nExecutive Board are convened and chaired by the Chairman of the Executive Board. Each\nmember of the Executive Board can arrange an additional meeting on a specific topic at any\ntime. If the Chairman of the Executive Board is unable to attend, the meeting shall be chai-\n32\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nred by the member of the Executive Board designated for this purpose by the Chairman of\nthe Executive Board or by the oldest member of the Executive Board. The Executive Board\nconstitutes a quorum if all members have been invited and more than half of its members\nare present at the time the resolution is adopted, whereby members of the Executive Board\nconnected by telephone or video conference are deemed to be present. Unless otherwise\nprovided by law, the Articles of Association or the Rules of Procedure, the Executive Board\nshall decide by a simple majority of the votes cast. In the case of a tie, the Chairman of the\nExecutive Board shall cast the deciding vote.\nEach member of the Executive Board will disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory\nBoard without delay and inform the other members of the Executive Board accordingly.\nMembers of the Executive Board may only take on secondary activities, in particular Super-\nvisory Board mandates outside the company, with the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nLong-term succession planning for the Executive Board and age limit for the\nExecutive Board\nAIXTRON is a global company operating in a very dynamic and technologically demanding\nmarket environment. Therefore, it is of strategic importance for AIXTRON to have a compe-\ntent Executive Board and to appoint suitable candidates to the Executive Board. After the\ncomplete change of generation in the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board will also pur-\nsue a long-term succession planning. As part of the succession planning, the Supervisory\nBoard and the Executive Board will also discuss suitable internal candidates to be appointed\nto the Executive Board. The age limit for the Executive Board is 65 years and is set out in the\nExecutive Board's Rules of Procedure.\nSupervisory Board and its composition\nPursuant to Article 11 of AIXTRON SE’s Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board consists\nof five members. The members of the Supervisory Board are generally appointed until the\nend of the Annual General Meeting in which the shareholders represented ratify the ap-\nproval of the Supervisory Board’s activities for the fourth fiscal year after the term of office\nbegins, whereby the fiscal year in which the appointment was made is not included.\nThe Supervisory Board elects a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman from among its members.\nThe Supervisory Board Chairman or – if he is unable to do so – his Deputy convenes and con-\nducts the Supervisory Board meetings.\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted Rules of Procedure. They govern the tasks, rights and\nobligations of the Supervisory Board, the organization of meetings and resolutions and the\nformation of committees. The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board were last revised\nin fiscal year 2021. The Audit Committee has separate Rules of Procedure established by the\n33\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nSupervisory Board.\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board is generally available for discussions with investors\nbut only to the extent that such discussions take place within a reasonable framework and\nthe topics fall within the sole competence of the Supervisory Board. No discussions with the\nChairman of the Supervisory Board were requested in the past fiscal year. Accordingly, no\nsuch discussions took place.\nCurrently, the composition of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Articles of Asso-\nciation and as determined by the General Meeting is as follows:\nComposition of the Supervisory Board\n(as of December 31, 2021)\nName Position Since End of Term\nChairman of the Supervisory\nKim Schindelhauer1)2)3)4)5) 2002 AGM 2022\nBoard\nChairwoman of the Audit Com-\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber1) mittee, independent financial 2019 AGM 2024\nexpert\nProf. Dr. Andreas Biagosch1)2) 2013 AGM 2024\nProf. Dr. Petra Denk3)4) 2011 AGM 2024\nDeputy chairman of the Super-\nvisory Board\nFrits van Hout3)4) Chairman of the Nomination 2019 AGM 2024\nCommittee/Remuneration\nCommittee\n1) Member of the Audit Committee\n2) Member of the Capital Market Committee\n3) Member of the Nomination Committee\n4) Member of the Remuneration Committee\n5) Former AIXTRON Executive Board member\nComposition of Committees\nCapital Market Remuneration\nAudit Committee Committee Nomination Committee Committee\nProf. Dr. Anna Weber Frits van Hout Frits van Hout\nKim Schindelhauer\n(Chair) (Chair) (Chair)\nProf. Dr. Andreas\nKim Schindelhauer Prof. Dr. Petra Denk Prof. Dr. Petra Denk\nBiagosch\nProf. Dr. Andreas\nKim Schindelhauer Kim Schindelhauer\nBiagosch\n34\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIndependence of Supervisory Board Members and cooperation between the\nSupervisory Board and the Executive Board\nThe Supervisory Board shall comprise what it considers to be a sufficient number of indepen-\ndent members (Recommendation C.6 DCGK 2020). Accordingly, the Supervisory Board has\nset itself the goal that more than half of its members shall be independent (recommendation\nC.7 DCGK 2020). AIXTRON considers Mr. Schindelhauer to be independent despite the period\nof time he has been a member of the Supervisory Board. During his time as Chairman of the\nSupervisory Board, Mr. Schindelhauer has always maintained a professional distance from\nthe Company and the Executive Board and has always fulfilled his monitoring and advisory\nduties by applying an appropriate critical attitude (recommendation C.8 DCGK 2020).\nAs all members of the Supervisory Board, which consists exclusively of elected shareholder\nrepresentatives, are therefore to be regarded as independent, this objective is also met or\ndeclared.\nThe Supervisory Board includes Mr. Schindelhauer, a former member of the Executive Board,\nwhose term of office as a member of the Executive Board, however, was more than two years\nago (see also C.7 DCGK 2020). The Supervisory Board therefore complies with recommen-\ndation C.11 of the DCGK 2020 that it should not include more than two former members of\nthe Executive Board.\nThe Supervisory Board must include at least one member with expertise in the field of audi-\nting and at least one other member with expertise in the field of accounting. These require-\nments are met by the two members Prof. Dr. Weber and Mr. Schindelhauer.\nIn the run-up to the Supervisory Board meeting in December 2021, the members of the Su-\npervisory Board received the self-evaluation questionnaire prepared annually by the Chair-\nman of the Supervisory Board. After evaluation of the questionnaire, the Supervisory Board\ndetermined that the Supervisory Board performs its activities effectively in accordance with\nrecommendation D.13 of the DCGK 2020.\nFurther mandates of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are\nlisted in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in section 36 “Supervisory Board\nand Management Board”.\nThe Company did not enter into or carry out any material transactions with any related par-\nties in the 2021 fiscal year.\nThe Audit Committee is chaired by Prof. Dr. Weber, an independent and expert member of\nthe Supervisory Board in accordance with Recommendation D.4 DCGK 2020. She is not the\nsame person as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In the persons of Prof. Dr. Weber and\nMr. Schindelhauer, the Audit Committee includes one member with expertise in the field of\nauditing and one further member with expertise in the field of accounting.\n35\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLike the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board holds four regular meetings per calendar\nyear. Extraordinary Supervisory Board meetings as well as meetings of the Nomination Com-\nmittee and the Capital Market Committee are convened as required.\nAt the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairmen of the Committees,\nthe Executive Board regularly attends the ordinary meetings (generally four times a year) of\nthe Supervisory Board or individual committee meetings, reports in writing and orally on the\nindividual agenda items and draft resolutions and answers the questions of the individual\nSupervisory Board members. Between meetings, all members of the Supervisory Board re-\nceive detailed quarterly reports from the Executive Board on the situation of the Company. In\naddition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee\nare informed by the Executive Board about important developments and upcoming impor-\ntant decisions in telephone calls and personal discussions. In accordance with recommenda-\ntion D.7 DCGK 2020, meetings are also held regularly without participation of the Executive\nBoard.\nAs a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board and its committees are passed at the mee-\ntings. In justified exceptional cases, Supervisory Board members may also participate in a\nmeeting of the Supervisory Board or a committee by telephone or video conference. The\nSupervisory Board and its committees shall each constitute a quorum if two thirds of its\nmembers participate in the adoption of the resolution (outside of meetings by means of a\nvote conducted in writing, by fax, by telephone or by e-mail or by a combination of these\naforementioned communication media, provided that no member of the Supervisory Board\nobjects to this procedure). Resolutions require a simple majority of the votes cast. In the\nevent of a tie, the chairman of the meeting has the casting vote.\nEach member of the Supervisory Board shall disclose to the Supervisory Board any conflicts\nof interest, in particular those that may arise as a result of a consultancy or directorship\nfunction with customers, suppliers, lenders or other third parties. Material and not only tem-\nporary conflicts of interest in the person of a member of the Supervisory Board result in that\nperson having to resign from office.\nSelf-evaluation of the Supervisory Board\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-evaluation based on a\nquestionnaire, taking into account AIXTRON-specific topics. The results were discussed by the\nSupervisory Board and confirmed that the cooperation both within the Supervisory Board\nand with the Executive Board was characterized by a high degree of trust and openness and\nwas always professional and constructive. The Supervisory Board and its committees were\nalso considered to be adequately informed and effective in their work. Hence there is no\nfundamental need for change.\n36\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation on the equal representation of men and women as per\nSection 76 para. 4 and Section 111 para. 5 AktG\nPursuant to Sections 76 para. 4, 111 para. 5 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the\nSupervisory boards and Executive Boards of companies that are listed on the stock exchange\nor subject to co-determination must set target figures for the proportion of women on the\nSupervisory Boards, Executive Boards and the two management levels below the Executive\nBoard. The DCGK reflects these regulations in principle 3 and principle 9 sentence 2 DCGK\n2020 for the Executive Board and in recommendation C.1 sentence 2 DCGK 2020 for the\nSupervisory Board.\nAIXTRON aims to increase both the proportion of women and the internationality of its em-\nployees and managers. In doing so, the Company is primarily committed to the professional\nand social qualification of all employees.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE had set the following target figures for the propor-\ntion of women to be reached by 31 December 2025:\nTarget per Target per Women’s quota as\nLevel 31.12.2025 31.12.2021 of 31.12.2021 Determined by\nSupervisory Board 20% 16.7% 40% Supervisory Board\nExecutive Board 0% 0% 0% Supervisory Board\nSince the initial determination of the target figures for achievement by December 31, 2021,\nthe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has been reduced from six to five members. The five-\nmember Supervisory Board includes two women, bringing the proportion of female Supervi-\nsory Board members to 40%. The current composition of the Executive Board is in line with\nthe target set for the Executive Board.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE has set itself the goal of specifically promoting women\nin the Company. In line with this, the Executive Board has raised the targets for the propor-\ntion of women now to 10% for the first level below the Executive Board and to 20% for the\nsecond level below the Executive Board. These targets are to be achieved by December 31,\n2025.\nTarget per Target per Women’s quota as\nLevel 31.12.2025 31.12.2021 of 31.12.2021 Determined by\n1. tier management 10% 3% 4% Executive Board\n2. tier management 20% 17% 17% Executive Board\nIn the year 2021, the Company has therefore achieved the targets set.\nFollowing the successful appointment of vacant positions on the Executive Board, in which\nthe Supervisory Board took the diversity concept into account and as part of which fema-\nle candidates were also considered, the generational transition on the Executive Board has\nbeen completed. Based on the structure now in place, no changes in composition are plan-\n37\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nned, so the target for the proportion of women on the Executive Board valid until December\n31, 2025, has been set consistently at 0%. The proportion of women on the Executive Board\nis taken into account as part of the long-term succession planning.\nDiversity concept for Executive Board and Supervisory Board\nExecutive Board\nAs provided for by the DCGK 2020, AIXTRON has addressed diversity objectives (“diversity”)\nin corporate governance (recommendations B.1 and C.1).\nWhen proposing the appointment of new members to the Executive Board by the Nomina-\nting Committee, the Supervisory Board takes into account their personal and professional\nsuitability, international experience and leadership quality, the age limit set for members of\nthe Executive Board, and diversity, including aspects such as age, gender, and educational\nand professional background. The Executive Board should consist of members with different,\ncomplementary competence profiles as well as a sufficient age mix and possess different\npersonalities.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned qualities, members of the Executive Board should, as far\nas possible, have different knowledge and experience as well as educational and professio-\nnal backgrounds, both individually and in their entirety as a team. In view of the Company's\ninternational orientation, experience abroad is an advantage. In its search for suitable candi-\ndates to fill vacant positions on the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board took account of\nthe diversity concept and, as part of this, also considered female candidates.\nSupervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board had set the target for the proportion of women on the Supervisory\nBoard at 16.7% and the deadline for achieving this target on December 31, 2021. With Prof.\nDr. Petra Denk and Prof. Dr. Anna Weber, two of the five members of the Supervisory Board\nare women currently (40%).\nThe targets for the compositions of the Supervisory Board are shown in detail below:\n• When proposing candidates for election to the Supervisory Board, the Nomination\nCommittee ensures that the Supervisory Board always includes members who,\nindividually and collectively as a team, have the knowledge, skills and professional\nexperience required to properly perform their duties. Furthermore, the members\nshould be independent. In this way, the nomination committee contributes to\nincreasing the efficiency and transparency of the selection process. As a general rule,\nSupervisory Boards should be elected for the longest period of time permitted by the\nstatutes.\n38\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n• AIXTRON is strongly export-oriented. Experience in AIXTRON’s specific electronics and\nsemiconductor markets is therefore a great advantage.\n• As a general rule, an age limit of 70 years should be appropriate for Supervisory Board\nmembers upon retirement. New Supervisory Board members should be available to\nthe Company for at least two election periods.\n• It is desirable that the individual members of the Supervisory Board have the most\ndiverse education, qualifications, expertise and international experience possible in\norder to have the knowledge, skills and professional experience necessary to properly\nperform their duties. Company- and product-oriented coverage with an understanding\nof the business model, the industry-specific features and the processes in the\nvarious corporate areas of business administration, accounting, auditing, corporate\ndevelopment, capital market, technology, equipment business, markets / distribution,\nsemiconductor market etc. are advantageous.\n• It is in the best interests of the company to utilize the potential of well-trained and\nmotivated employees of different nationalities and genders. The Supervisory Board\nconsiders appropriate participation of women on the Supervisory Board to be very\nimportant, which is reflected in the current proportion of women on the Supervisory\nBoard of 40%.\n• In its opinion, the Supervisory Board should have a sufficient number of independent\nmembers, whereby a member of the Supervisory Board shall not be considered\nindependent in particular if he or she has a business or personal relationship with\nthe company, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder or a company affiliated\nwith the latter that could give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of\ninterest.\n• More than half of the Supervisory Board shall consist of independent members.\n• No more than two former members of the Executive Board shall be members of the\nSupervisory Board.\n• The members of the Supervisory Board shall not exercise directorships or similar\npositions or advisory tasks for important competitors of the enterprise.\n• At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of\naccounting and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have\nexpertise in the field of auditing. These two members shall then also be members of\nthe Audit Committee.\n• Due to the increased demands on the professionalization of the Supervisory Board and\nin order to simultaneously ensure the greatest possible efficiency of the Supervisory\nBoard’s activities as in previous years, new Supervisory Board members should not\nhold more than five mandates in other listed companies or other companies if they\nhave comparable requirements.\n39\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIn addition to the goals set for its composition, the Supervisory Board has also drawn up a\ncompetence profile for the entire Board. In view of AIXTRON’s business activities and the\nmarkets addressed by the Company, the Supervisory Board shall have competencies in the\nareas of technology, finance / accounting, capital markets, strategy and corporate gover-\nnance. Furthermore, a grown network of contacts and many years of experience in the re-\nspective disciplines are advantageous.\nThe requirement for diversity within the Supervisory Board (recommendation C.1 sentence\n2 DCGK 2020) is taken into account, among other things, as a result of the diverse compe-\ntencies of the individual Supervisory Board members (with regard to areas such as finance,\ncapital markets, M&A, and technology and markets).\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE are convinced that the com-\nposition of the Supervisory Board fully complies with its own objectives and competence\nprofile as well as with the requirement of the DCGK for appropriate diversity and an appro-\npriate number of independent Supervisory Board members.\nInformation on the remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\nand on the remuneration system of the Executive Board\nDetailed information on the structure and amount of remuneration paid to the individual\nExecutive Board members in accordance with principle 25 DCGK 2020 and on the remune-\nration of the members of the Supervisory Board as well as an exact list of the outstanding\nBoard stock options can be found in the remuneration report as part of the Group’s conso-\nlidated management report.\nThe remuneration system pursuant to Section 87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG approved by\nthe 2020 Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 113 (3) AktG with an approval rate of\n90.3% is publicly available on the Company's website at Remuneration Policy. A remunera-\ntion report prepared in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n(AktG) for the past fiscal year together with an auditors' report in accordance with Section\n162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is also available on the Company's website.\n40\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nShareholders and Annual General Meeting\nAs in 2020, the Annual General Meeting in the 2021 fiscal year was held in completely virtu-\nal form again on May 19, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated contact\nrestrictions. The invitation to the Annual General Meeting was published in due time in the\nGerman Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) in accordance with the statutory requirements\nand contained, among other things, the agenda with the proposed resolutions of the ad-\nministration or the Supervisory Board as well as the conditions for attending the Annual\nGeneral Meeting and exercising voting rights. All reports and documents required by law\nwere available on the AIXTRON website from the time the General Meeting was convened.\nImmediately after the Annual General Meeting, AIXTRON published the attendance and vo-\nting results on its website.\nSix out of seven agenda items were put to the vote. All resolutions were passed with clear\nmajorities, with slightly more than 63% of AIXTRON's share capital being represented at the\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM).\nTransparency\nTo ensure maximum transparency, AIXTRON regularly and promptly informs interested par-\nties such as customers, suppliers, shareholders, shareholder associations, potential inves-\ntors, financial analysts and the media of the Group’s business developments. The internet is\nthe primary communication channel used for this purpose.\nReports on the business situation and financial results of AIXTRON SE and the AIXTRON Group\nare made available in German and / or English, in the form of:\n• The Annual Report with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Combined\nManagement Report and the Supervisory Board Report,\n• The Financial Statements of AIXTRON SE, with the Combined Management Report,\n• The non-financial Group Report (Sustainability Report),\n• Interim financial reports,\n• Quarterly conference calls for the press and analysts and respective transcripts,\n• Company presentations,\n• Publication of insider information, corporate and press releases.\n41\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe date of the Annual General Meeting or the publication dates of the financial reports are\nsummarized in the Company’s financial calendar on the AIXTRON website in the section In-\nvestors / events and dates. This calendar, as well as the reports, speech manuscripts, presen-\ntations, webcasts, and announcements listed above, can be freely viewed on the AIXTRON\nwebsite for a certain period of time.\nAccounting and Audit of the Annual Financial Statements\nThe quarterly reports as of 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and the consolidated financial\nstatements as of 31 December 2021 were prepared in accordance with the International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The separate financial statements of AIXTRON SE for\nfiscal year 2021 were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial\nCode (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\nThe consolidated financial statements and the individual financial statements of AIXTRON SE\nwere audited by the auditor and approved by the Supervisory Board. It was agreed with the\nauditors that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chair of the Audit Committee\nwould be informed immediately of any reasons for exclusion or exemption or any inaccura-\ncies in the Declaration of Conformity that arise during the audit. No such duties to inform\nwere triggered in the year under review.\n42\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration Report\nWith the approval of the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020, a new compensation\nsystem (\"new compensation system\") for the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE was introduced.\nSince then, this has been applied to all new contracts of the Executive Board of the Compa-\nny. For existing legacy contracts of the Executive Board, the previous compensation system\napproved by the regular general shareholders meeting on May 16, 2018 (\"previous compen-\nsation system\") continued to be applied. In the reporting year, the previous remuneration\nsystem was applied for the last time for Executive Board member Dr. Bernd Schulte until his\nretirement after March 31, 2021. A detailed description of the previous remuneration system\nis available in the Annual Report 2020.\nThe following remuneration report describes the main features of the new remuneration\nsystem and explains the amount and structure of the remuneration of the Executive Board\nas well as the remuneration of the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2021 in\naccordance with the articles of association. The remuneration of the individual members of\nthe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is disclosed individually in the remuneration\nreport. The Renumeration Report complies with the disclosure requirements under German\nstock corporation law pursuant to Section 162 AktG. In addition, the remuneration report\nis based in particular on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code\n(DCGK) and the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\nPriciples of the new remuneration system\n(applicable to new Executive Board contracts since May 20, 2020)\nThe new remuneration system of the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE introduced in fiscal year\n2020 is in line with the content requirements of ARUG II and is based on the recommendati-\nons of the new German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK 2020) which came into force on\nMarch 20, 2020.\nScope of application in fiscal year 2021\nThe new remuneration system was applied to new Executive Board employment contracts in\nfiscal year 2021 as follows:\n• Dr. Felix Grawert: from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021\n• Dr. Christian Danninger: from May 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021\n• Dr. Jochen Linck: from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021\n43\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nPriciples of the new remuneration system\nExecutive Board remuneration at AIXTRON SE is structured in a way that creates incentives\nfor the sustainable, long-term development of the Company and for the long-term commit-\nment of Executive Board members.\nThe Supervisory Board sets the specific remuneration for each Executive Board member\non the basis of the remuneration system. To the extent legally permissible, the Supervisory\nBoard seeks to offer Executive Board members remuneration that is both in line with the\nmarket and competitive, also in order to be able to recruit outstanding individuals to AIXTRON\nSE and gain their long-term commitment.\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board sets target total remuneration\nfor each individual Executive Board member for the forthcoming fiscal year. This consists of\nthree components:\n• fixed remuneration,\n• short-term performance-related variable remuneration (short-term incentive, STI),\nand\n• long-term performance-related variable remuneration (long-term incentive, LTI).\nRemuneration structure\n3 years\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\n(reference period)\n1 year\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI)\n(fiscal year)\nFixed remuneration Fixed\nFixed remuneration consists of fixed, non-performance-related base remuneration, which is\npaid out as a monthly salary. Other components of fixed remuneration include fringe bene-\nfits, such as the provision of a company car, allowances for individual private pensions, and\nthe assumption of costs for other insurance policies.\n44\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nVariable remuneration is tied to the performance of the AIXTRON Group and consists of\nshort-term variable remuneration (STI) and long-term variable remuneration (LTI). The\namount of both components depends on the achievement of financial and non-financial\nperformance indicators.\nShort-term performance-related variable remuneration (STI) in new remuneration\nsystem\nThe short-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the short-term in-\ncentive (STI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group in the given fiscal year and\nis paid out in full in cash.\nThe STI is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for the year, the market\nposition of the AIXTRON Group, as well as financial and operational targets. In this regard, the\nrelative weighting amounts to 70% for consolidated net income for the year, 15% for market\nposition, and 15% for financial and operational targets.\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI)\nTarget Setting Calculation\nTarget Value (amount) Target\nachievement\nTargets (key figures)\nFiscal year Amount (cash)\nPayment\nThe targets are set prior to the start of a fiscal year: The Supervisory Board establishes the\nSTI‘s target value and the targets based on the aforementioned indicators. In the event of\n100% target achievement, the individual target STI of the Executive Board members varies\nfrom 1.1% to 1.75% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the budget ap-\nproved by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year.\nSTI target achievement is determined after the expiry of the fiscal year. This is capped at a\nmaximum of 250% target achievement. No STI is paid if the consolidated net income for the\nyear is negative, i.e. in years in which the Company posts a loss. STI is paid out in cash after\nthe Supervisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements.\n45\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLong-term performance-related variable remuneration (LTI) in new remuneration system\nThe amount of long-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the long-\nterm incentive (LTI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group over a 3-year\nreference period and is granted entirely in AIXTRON shares. Executive Board members may\nfirst dispose of these shares following a four-year holding period calculated from the start of\nthe reference period.\nBefore the start of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets for\neach Executive Board member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive Board\nmember receives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI, which varies from\n1.4% to 2.25% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the budget adopted\nby the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year. The number of forfeitable stock awards is calcu-\nlated based on the average of the closing prices on all stock market trading days in the final\nquarter of the previous year. If consolidated net income for the year is budgeted to be zero or\nnegative, and if a return to profitability is expected during the reference period, the Supervi-\nsory Board may within reasonable limits specify a LTI value for the fiscal year.\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\nTarget Setting Calculation\nTarget Value (amount) Target\nachievement\nTargets (key figures)\nReference period\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nRestriction period\nAIXTRON\nForfeitable stock awards Vested stock awards\nshares\nConversion Transfer\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for the\nyear and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. In this regard, the\nrelative weighting amounts to 50% for consolidated net income for the year, 40% for TSR, and\n10% for sustainability targets.\nFor the first LTI key figure, the consolidated net income for the year, before the start of\neach fiscal year the Supervisory Board sets a target value on the aggregate consolidated\nnet incomes that are to be achieved during the reference period. After the reference period\nends, the ratio of the actual value to the target value is calculated. If the two values are iden-\ntical, target achievement amounts to 100%. Target achievement is capped at a maximum of\n250%. If the ratio is zero or negative, target achievement amounts to 0%. A linear interpola-\ntion takes place between the values of 0% and 250%.\n46\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe second LTI key figure, the TSR, denotes the total shareholder return over the reference\nperiod and is calculated as the ratio of the change in the stock price, plus paid dividends, at\nthe end of the reference period to the value at the start of the reference period. The TSR for\nAIXTRON stock is determined by the weighted TSR for a comparative group, which consists\nof the shares of six semiconductor equipment manufacturers – Veeco Instruments, Applied\nMaterials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, ASML, and ASMI – and is weighted in proportion to\ntheir market capitalization. Changes in the share prices are determined by reference to the\ndifference between the average values of the closing prices on all stock market trading days\nin the final quarter before the start of the reference period and in the final quarter of the\nreference period. After the reference period ends, the ratio of the development in the TSR\nfor AIXTRON shares to the development in the TSR for the comparative group is calculated.\nTarget achievement is capped at a maximum of 250% and amounts to 0% if the ratio is less\nthan 50%. A linear interpolation takes place between these values. If during the period under\nconsideration the enterprises in the comparative group experience extraordinary changes\n(such as mergers, changes in business activities, etc.), the Supervisory Board may take this\nappropriately into consideration with regard to the composition of the comparative group.\nIn such case, the Supervisory Board will report on this in the annual remuneration report.\nThe third LTI key figure is calculated by reference to sustainability targets set by the Super-\nvisory Board at the start of each reference period. These targets refer to the areas of envi-\nronment, social affairs, and good corporate governance. Target achievement corresponds to\nthe ratio of the actual values to the target values and is capped at 250%. Before the start of\neach fiscal year, the Supervisory Board sets two to three sustainability targets that are to be\nachieved by the end of the reference period. The sustainability targets that the Supervisory\nBoard may choose from before the start of a fiscal year when setting targets for the respec-\ntive Executive Board member include, among others: efficient use of energy and raw mate-\nrials, reduction of emissions, employee satisfaction and development, customer satisfaction,\ninnovation achievements, successor planning, and compliance.\nAfter the expiry of the three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement is\ndetermined by the Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement, the\nforfeitable stock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise lapse. The\nmaximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection with LTI is cap-\nped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start of the reference\nperiod.\nFollowing expiry of the four-year restriction period, the shares are transferred to the Execu-\ntive Board member, with due compliance with the maximum remuneration limits set out be-\nlow. The Executive Board member is not entitled to receive dividends during the restriction\nperiod.\n47\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration limits in new remuneration system\nThe remuneration system is intended to provide appropriate rewards for successful Execu-\ntive Board work and to ensure that the Executive Board and shareholders all benefit from the\nCompany‘s positive development. At the same time, to prevent the taking of inappropriate\nrisks and ensure an appropriate relation to the situation of the AIXTRON Group, Executive\nBoard remuneration is limited by setting a maximum remuneration and a remuneration\ncap.\nMaximum remuneration (expenditure cap) is the total remuneration owed to the Executive\nBoard for a fiscal year. It may not exceed EUR 6.5 million in the case of two Executive Board\nmembers or EUR 10.0 million in the case of three or more Executive Board members. This\nalso represents the expenditure cap, i.e. the maximum expense for the Company.\nThere is also a remuneration cap (allocation cap) for the aggregate of fixed remuneration,\nSTI, and LTI. The actual allocation for each Executive Board member for a fiscal year is capped\nat four times the Executive Board member’s target total remuneration. This is the allocation\ncap. If the remuneration cap is exceeded, a portion of the vested stock awards previously\nawarded is forfeited to ensure compliance.\nFixed remuneration will generally account for 20% to 40% of target total remuneration,\nwhile variable remuneration will make up 60% to 80%. Long-term remuneration will ac-\ncount for a greater share of remuneration in order to provide incentives for long-term and\nsustainable actions. No additional remuneration is paid for group-internal mandates, such as\nat subsidiaries.\nFurther provisions governing new remuneration system\nTo ensure that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of shareholders,\nthe Company has a stock ownership policy. Following a four-year build-up phase, each Exe-\ncutive Board member is obliged to hold AIXTRON stock worth 100% of their base remunera-\ntion on a permanent basis throughout their term of office. The value of vested stock awards\nis set off against the respective target shareholding value. Executive Board members may sell\nshares only if they exceed the respective target value.\nFurthermore, a sanctioning mechanism, i. e. claw-back policy, applies for breaches of duty\nor compliance. Based on this mechanism, in the event of such breaches the Supervisory\nBoard may reduce variable remuneration components not yet paid out, allow stock awards\nto lapse, or even claw these back. These possibilities may be exercised even when the Execu-\ntive Board member is no longer in office and is no longer employed by the Company.\n48\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIn justified exceptional circumstances, such as severe economic crises, the effects of which\nrender the original Company targets invalid, the Supervisory Board may resolve a temporary\ndivergence from the remuneration system if such divergence is in the interests of AIXTRON\nSE. As a general rule, the targets and target values do not change during the periods relevant\nfor the respective target achievement, even if developments in the overall market are unfa-\nvorable.\nA detailed description of the new Executive Board remuneration system adopted by the An-\nnual General Meeting on May 20, 2020 can be found on AIXTRON‘s website under Remune-\nration Policy.\nComparison of remuneration in new remuneration system\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the appropriateness of the various components of remu-\nneration on an annual basis. The remuneration system is presented to the Annual General\nMeeting for approval in the event of any material changes to the system and at least every\nfour years.\nFor the purposes of external comparison, the Supervisory Board refers to remuneration data\nat the semiconductor equipment manufacturers Veeco Instruments, Applied Materials, Lam\nResearch, ASML, and ASMI, as well as to those companies listed in the TecDAX that have\nmarket capitalizations between 50% and 200% of that at AIXTRON SE.\nFor the internal comparison, the Supervisory Board defines the senior management level as\nthe ten senior managers whose remuneration is not tied to collective bargaining agreements\nand who have the greatest managerial responsibility and decision-making powers.\nReporting in new remuneration system\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board prepare a remuneration report each year in\naccordance with statutory provisions. For the fiscal year 2021, a remuneration report in ac-\ncordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) as amended by ARUG II\nis presented for the first time. This report explains which performance criteria were applied\nand how the respective amounts of the variable compensation components were calculated.\nThe remuneration report for the past fiscal year contains an outlook on the application of the\nremuneration system in the current fiscal year. This outlook reports in advance on the selec-\ntion of the financial and non-financial performance criteria. However, the non-financial per-\nformance criteria, as well as the specific targets for the financial indicators, are not explained\nin detail until after the end of the relevant periods for STI and/or LTI in order not to disclose\ncompetition-relevant strategic plans in advance.\n49\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nArrangements upon contract termination\nShould a contract with an Executive Board member be terminated, then the outstanding\nvariable remuneration components attributable to the time through to termination of the\ncontract will be paid out in accordance with the originally agreed targets and comparison\nparameters and with the due dates or holding periods specified in the contract. If an Exe-\ncutive Board contract ends during a fiscal year, STI and LTI are granted on a prorated basis\nrelative to the length of service in this fiscal year.\nThe foregoing does not apply to cases in which the employment contract is terminated without\nnotice for cause inherent in the Executive Board member for which he or she is responsible.\nIn such case, variable remuneration will not be paid for the year in which termination beco-\nmes effective.\nIn the case of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate by reason of revoca-\ntion of the appointment, the Executive Board member will be paid a severance equal to the\nremuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the remaining term of the employ-\nment contract, but not more than two years of remuneration (severance cap).\nWhen agreeing employment contracts with Executive Board members, the Supervisory\nBoard may stipulate that, in the event of the contract being terminated due to a “change-of-\ncontrol” event, severance will be paid in the aforementioned maximum amount. A change-\nof-control event in the foregoing sense exists where a third party, or a group of third parties\nwho combine their shareholding by contract in order to act as a single third party, directly or\nindirectly holds more than 50% of the Company’s share capital.\nNo benefits in excess of this severance payment are permitted.\nIn the event of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate based on mutual\nagreement to end the employment contract, the total value of benefits pledged by the Com-\npany to the Executive Board member in connection with such agreement may not exceed the\namount of remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the original remaining\nterm of the employment contract and may not exceed a maximum of two annual remune-\nration packages.\n50\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Executive Board members in fiscal year 2021\nExecutive Board remuneration\nIn fiscal year 2021, exclusively the new remuneration system described above was applied for\nthe members of the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE with the exception of Dr. Bernd Schulte,\nwhose legacy contract expired on March 31, 2021. The following section specifies the con-\ncrete Executive Board remuneration for the reporting year and contains detailed information\nand background on the total Executive Board remuneration, the target setting and target\nachievement of the variable remuneration as well as individualized information on the remu-\nneration of the individual Executive Board members for fiscal year 2021.\nTotal remuneration for fiscal year 2021\nThe total remuneration of the Executive Board for the financial year 2021 amounted to kEUR\n8,437 (2020: kEUR 2,956). The non-performance-related fixed remuneration of the Executive\nBoard for the fiscal year 2021, consisting of a basic remuneration, pension allowances and\nbenefits in kind, totaled kEUR 1,106 (2020: kEUR 912).\nBase remuneration for fiscal year 2021\nBase remuneration comprised the following amounts in fiscal year 2021:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: kEUR 400\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: kEUR 200 (May 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021)\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: kEUR 300\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: kEUR 90 (January 1, 2021 – March 31, 2021)\nPension allowances for fiscal year 2021\nThe Executive Board members in office in the year under report do not have individual pen-\nsion commitments, as a result of which no provisions are stated for pensions. The Company\nrather pays pension allowances to Executive Board members together with their salaries or\nmakes contributions to an insurance contract with a pension fund.\n51\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nPension allowances form a constituent component of the non-performance-related fixed\nremuneration of the Executive Board. They comprised the following amounts in fiscal year\n2021:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: kEUR 30\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: kEUR 20 (May 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021)\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: kEUR 30\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: kEUR 10 (January 1, 2021 – March 31, 2021)\nVariable remuneration for fiscal year 2021 under former remuneration system\nThe former remuneration system was applied in 2021 to determine the variable remunera-\ntion for Dr. Bernd Schulte from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2021. The variable remunera-\ntion under the former remuneration system amounts to 2.5% of consolidated net income per\nExecutive Board member on a pro rata basis and is paid half in cash and half in shares. This\nresults in variable remuneration for 2021 under the previous remuneration system:\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: kEUR 296 in cash and kEUR 296 to be granted in shares.\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI) for fiscal year 2021 under new\nremuneration system\nThe new remuneration system was applied in 2021 to determine the short-term variable\nremuneration for Dr. Felix Grawert, Dr. Christian Danninger and Dr. Jochen Linck.\nTarget dimension “consolidated net income for the year”\nAt its meeting on December 9, 2020, the Supervisory Board set a target of kEUR 44,900 for\nconsolidated net income in 2021 (70% of total target). The actual figure of kEUR 94,839 re-\nsults in a target achievement of 211%.\nTarget dimension “market position”\nFor the target dimension \"market position\" (15% of total target), the Supervisory Board set\ntargets for individual market segments for 2021. Good sales performance in the existing mar-\nkets and success in the growth markets led to a target achievement of 205%.\n52\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTarget dimension “financial and operational targets”\nFor the target dimension \"Financial and operational targets\" (15% of total target), perfor-\nmance criteria were defined in the area of operational performance, the market launch of\nnew products, and for the OLED business unit. Here, target achievement in the past fiscal\nyear was 127%.\nBased on the achievement of these three target dimensions, short-term variable remune-\nration (STI) is calculated for fiscal year 2021 under the new remuneration system as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: kEUR 1,552 in cash\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: kEUR 655 in cash (May 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021)\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: kEUR 976 in cash.\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI) for fiscal year 2021 under new\nremuneration system\nIn 2021, the new remuneration system was applied to the contracts with Dr. Felix Grawert,\nDr. Christian Danninger (since May 1, 2021) and Dr. Jochen Linck. Target achievement for the\n2021 LTI tranche is calculated by reference to the results achieved in the period from January\n1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. It is determined by the following performance criteria:\n• Consolidated net income for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023 (50% of total)\n• Change in total shareholder return (TSR) from Q4 / 2020 to Q4 / 2023 (40% of total)\n• Sustainability (10% of total), measured in terms of energy consumption in kWh normed\nto the most important drivers of consumption and employee training measured in\nterms of learning hours\nThe relevant AIXTRON SE share price for the TSR target remuneration 2021 is EUR 11.582. It\ncorresponds to the average of the XETRA closing prices on all stock exchange trading days in\nQ4 / 2020. The degree of achievement of the performance criteria will be determined by the\nSupervisory Board after the end of fiscal year 2023. At that time, the vested share awards will\nbe converted into non-forfeitable share awards depending on target achievement. After the\nexpiry of a 4-year vesting period ending on December 31, 2024, for the fiscal year 2021, one\nshare of the Company will be transferred for each vested share award. This is to take place in\nthe week following the publication of the annual report.\n53\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFor the long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for 2021, the Supervisory Board stipulated the\nvalues of target LTI as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: kEUR 1,010 in forfeitable stock awards,\n• for Dr. Christian Danninger: kEUR 422 in forfeitable stock awards (May 1, 2021 –\nDecember 31, 2021),\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: kEUR 629 in forfeitable stock awards.\nTabular overview of performance criteria applied to Executive Board remunera-\ntion pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 1 Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\nInformation on the performance targets\na) Minimum a) Measured\ntarget a) Target achievement performance\nCompo- Description of b) Corresponding b) Corresponding b) Corresponding\nnent performance measures Portion remuneration remuneration remuneration\nkEUR a) 0 a) 44,900 a) 211%\nConsolidated net income 2021 70%\nkEUR b) 0 b) 1,128 b) 2,382\nSTI % a) 0 a) 100 a) 205\nMarket position 15%\n2021 kEUR b) 0 b) 242 b) 495\nFinancial and operational % a) 0 a) 100 a) 127\n15%\ntargets kEUR b) 0 b) 242 b) 306\nConsolidated net income % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n50%\n2020-2022 kEUR b) 0 b) 115 b) at the end of 2022\nLTI Total Shareholder Return % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n40%\n2020-2022 2020-2022 kEUR b) 0 b) 92 b) at the end of 2022\nSustainability targets % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n10%\nfor 2020-2022 kEUR b) 0 b) 23 b) at the end of 2022\nConsolidated net income % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n50%\n2021-2023 kEUR b) 0 b) 1,030 b) at the end of 2023\nLTI Total Shareholder Return % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n40%\n2021-2023 2021-2023 kEUR b) 0 b) 824 b) at the end of 2023\nSustainability targets % a) 0 a) 100 a) will be calculated\n10%\nfor 2021-2023 kEUR b) 0 b) 206 b) at the end of 2023\nDeviation from new remuneration system\nIn 2021, there were no deviations from and no adjustments to the remuneration system\ncompared with the AGM resolution on the remuneration system in May 2020.\n54\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nBenefits granted and payments made in fiscal year 2021\nThe following tables show the remuneration granted and due to the active members of the\nExecutive Board in each of the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in accordance with Section 162 (1)\nsentence 1 AktG. The \"Remuneration granted and due\" section of the tables thus contains all\namounts actually received by the individual Executive Board members in the reporting pe-\nriod (\"remuneration granted\") and all remuneration legally due but not yet received in the\nreporting period (\"remuneration due\"). In addition, the individual possible minimum and\nmaximum remuneration values for the 2021 fiscal year are shown here.\nFurthermore, in line with the DCGK 2020, the tables show the fixed remuneration and the\none-year variable remuneration as an inflow for the respective financial year. For subscrip-\ntion rights and other share-based remuneration, the time and value of the inflow is the rele-\nvant time and value under German tax law.\nIn addition to the remuneration amounts, Section 162 (1) sentence 2 no. 1 AktG also requires\nthe disclosure of the relative share of all fixed and variable remuneration components in to-\ntal remuneration. The relative proportions stated here at the end of each table relate to the\nremuneration components granted and due in the respective fiscal year in accordance with\nSection 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG.\nIn total, the remuneration of the Executive Board (\"remuneration granted and due\") for fiscal\nyear 2021 amounted to kEUR 8,437 (fiscal year 2020: kEUR 2,956) and was thus below the\nmaximum

The remuneration of the members of the\nExecutive Board included in the table reflects the remuneration granted and due to the re-\nspective Executive Board members in the reporting year and thus corresponds to the value\nstated in the preceding remuneration tables in the column \"Remuneration granted and due\"\nfor the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG\n(on page 56 - 58 of the Annual Report). Where members of the Executive Board were only\nremunerated on a pro rata basis in individual financial years, for example due to joining or\nleaving the company during the year, the remuneration for this fiscal year was extrapolated\nto a full year to ensure comparability.\nThe development of earnings is generally presented on the basis of the development of\nthe annual result of AIXTRON SE in accordance with Section 275 (3) No. 16 HGB (German\nCommercial Code). Since the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board is also\nsignificantly dependent on the business success of the AIXTRON Group, the development of\nthe revenues, the EBIT and the net income for the year is also stated for the Group.\nThe comparison with the development of the average remuneration of employees is based\non the average remuneration of the workforce of the Group parent company AIXTRON SE\nin Germany. Since the employee and remuneration structures in the subsidiaries are mani-\nfold, in particular in the case of employees abroad, it is appropriate for the comparison of\nthe development of the average remuneration to be based only on the total workforce of\nAIXTRON SE. This comparison group was also used in the examination of the appropriateness\nof the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board. In this context, the remunera-\ntion of all employees of AIXTRON SE, including executive employees and excluding student\nassistants, was taken into account. In order to ensure comparability, the remuneration of\npart-time employees was extrapolated to full-time equivalents.\n60\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nComparison of annual changes in Executive Board remuneration pursuant to Section 162\n(1) no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\nAnnual change (in %) 2021 versus 2020\nExecutive Board remuneration\nDr. Felix Grawert 166%\nDr. Christian Danninger* n. a.\nDr. Jochen Linck** 128%\nDr. Bernd Schulte*** 113%\nEarnings development of AIXTRON SE and the Group\nGroup revenues 59%\nGroup EBIT 184%\nGroup net income 175%\nAIXTRON SE net income 275%\nAverage remuneration of AIXTRON employees****\nEmployees of AIXTRON SE 9%\n* Executive Board member since May 1, 2021, thus no data available\n** Executive Board member since October 1, 2020, amount for 2020 annualized\n*** Executive Board member until March 31, 2021, amount for 2021 annualized\n**** based on full-time equivalents\nStock option plans\nStock options are neither components of the \"former remuneration system\" nor of the \"new\nremuneration system\" described above.

In addition, there are further\nsustainability targets which, however, when considered individually, are not essential\nfor the implementation of the corporate strategy.\nThe target achievement of the LTI remuneration 2022 is calculated on the basis of the results\nachieved in the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024. The relevant share price\nof AIXTRON SE for the LTI grant is EUR 19.64. It corresponds to the average of the XETRA\nclosing prices on all stock exchange trading days in the 4th quarter of 2021. The degree of\nfulfillment of the performance criteria will be determined by the Supervisory Board after the\nend of fiscal year 2024. At that time, the vested share awards will be converted into non-for-\nfeitable share awards depending on target achievement. After the expiry of a 4-year vesting\nperiod ending on December 31, 2025 for the fiscal year 2022, one share of the Company will\nbe transferred for each vested share award. This is to take place in the week following the\npublication of the annual report.\n62\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nRemuneration of Supervisory Board members\nRemuneration of the Supervisory Board is regulated in Article 17 of AIXTRON’s Articles of As-\nsociation.

The Execu-\ntive Board is responsible for managing the Company at its own responsibility while being ad-\nvised and monitored by the Supervisory Board. In 2021, there were the following personnel\nchanges in the Company’s management and supervisory bodies:\nDr. Bernd Schulte left the Executive Board at expiration of his contract on March 31, 2021,\nand retired. As of April 1, 2021, Dr. Felix Grawert was appointed Chairman of the Executive\nBoard. Thereafter, the Executive Board briefly consisted only of the two members Dr. Grawert\nand Dr. Linck. As of May 1, 2021, Dr. Christian Danninger joined the AIXTRON Group as the\nnew Chief Financial Officer. Since then, the Executive Board has again consisted of three per-\nsons. The composition of the Supervisory Board has not changed since December 31, 2020.\nDetailed information on the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board,\nthe allocation of responsibilities between them, the operating procedures of the Supervisory\nBoard committees and the Company‘s diversity concept can be found in the Corporate Go-\nvernance Declaration according to Section 289f HGB and Section 315d HGB, including the\nDeclaration of Conformity according to Section 161 AktG are part of the annual report and\nalso available on the AIXTRON website at Declaration of Corporate Governance.\nTechnology and Products\nAIXTRON’s product range includes customer-specific systems for the deposition of complex\nsemiconductor materials on a diverse range of different substrate sizes and materials.\nThe MOCVD process (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) is used for the vapor pha-\nse deposition of so-called compound semiconductor materials for the manufacture of power\nand optoelectronic components.\nIn the area of power electronics, our systems are used for the production of gallium nitri-\nde (GaN) semiconductor devices for more compact and more powerful power supplies in\nconsumer electronics, for the efficient power supply of data centers and mobile commu-\nnications infrastructure. In addition, our systems are used to manufacture GaN devices for\nwireless data transmission in mobile communications, currently primarily in the 5G area and\nsoon also in the 6G network. A second major application field of power electronics is silicon\ncarbide (SiC) devices, which are used e. g. in electric vehicles as well as their charging infras-\ntructure and in inverters for renewable energies (solar and wind). These components are also\nmanufactured by our customers with our CVD systems.\n68\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOur systems in the field of optoelectronics are used by customers to manufacture lasers\nfor optical data transmission and 3D sensor technology. They are used in smartphone facial\nrecognition, robotic environment sensing, autonomously driving vehicles, and other appli-\ncations requiring context recognition. Furthermore, our customers use AIXTRON equipment\nto manufacture pixels in display applications - currently deployed productively in the area of\nlarge area displays, and in the future also in the area of Micro LEDs. Other applications of our\nequipment include the production of specialty LEDs, such as red, orange, and yellow (ROY)\nLEDs for automotive lighting and indoor farming, among others. UV LEDs for environmentally\nfriendly disinfection of water and air are also included.\nAIXTRON is constantly working on the improvement of existing technologies and products.\nIn recent years, AIXTRON has introduced several new system generations and technologies.\nIn addition to the continuous improvement of material performance, the focus is particularly\non further optimizing the systems for high-volume production through more automation,\nsuch as the fully automated AIX G5+ C for GaN devices or the AIX G5 WW C for next-genera-\ntion silicon carbide (SiC) applications.\nBusiness Processes\nManufacturing and Procurement\nAIXTRON manufactures its prototype and customer equipment at its production sites in Her-\nzogenrath and in Cambridge. Production focuses on assembly, testing and qualification. The\nGroup procures the components required to manufacture the equipment and the majority of\nthe pre-assembled modules from external suppliers and service providers. The performance\nof our supply chains is being continuously improved both to secure higher overall demand\nand to compensate for fluctuating delivery capabilities. On the basis of a rolling forecast, the\nnecessary measures to ensure material availability are taken in close coordination between\nsales, purchasing and production. This also includes the early identification of bottlenecks\nin raw materials and components. Together with the partners in the supply chain, suitable\nstrategies are applied to ensure optimum availability while keeping an eye on inventories.\nThe assembly of the equipment is carried out with the help of external service providers in\nthe company's own production facilities or, if required, in rented production facilities and in\naccordance with AIXTRON’s technical specifications.\nSubsequent testing and qualification of the equipment is carried out by AIXTRON staff - as is\nproduction control and quality assurance throughout the production process.\nAIXTRON’s manufacturing facilities have process-oriented quality management systems cer-\ntified in accordance with ISO 9001:2015. In the year 2021, the certification of the quality\nmanagement systems of AIXTRON SE and AIXTRON Ltd. was confirmed without any deviation\nby external auditors.\n69\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEmployees\nAIXTRON’s leading position in the global market and its ability to continuously innovate are\ndriven by the commitment and excellent knowledge of our employees. Our human resources\nmanagement is therefore designed to create an inspiring, safe, and supportive environment,\nas well as to foster appreciative and cooperative interaction.\nAttracting and retaining highly qualified and committed specialists and managers is a key suc-\ncess factor. Competing for the best talent, we are continuously enhancing our attractiveness\nas an employer brand. In addition to a comprehensive, informative careers site and other\ncommunication channels, we use a wide variety of target group-oriented recruitment chan-\nnels, increasingly in social media. Personal contact with potential applicants at job fairs and\nsimilar events, as well as in the context of our close cooperation with universities worldwide,\nis also of great importance to us.\nAIXTRON is working consistently to establish a modern corporate culture with a mature\nleadership culture and good teamwork. We attach great importance to supporting our em-\nployees competently and in a spirit of partnership, to promoting them individually, and to\nchallenging them with future-oriented projects and tasks. As part of our company-wide per-\nsonnel development concept, we offer our employees a wide range of measures for conti-\nnuous training as well as individual advanced training measures and development opportu-\nnities.\nAnother central pillar of our corporate culture is AIXTRON’s commitment to diversity and\nequal opportunities, which form an essential basis for our innovative strength and competiti-\nveness. We explicitly encourage collaboration in mixed teams and between different cultures\nand nationalities. We also attach great importance to an appropriate gender balance and a\nbalanced age structure.\nIn the 2021 fiscal year, the number of employees in the Group decreased slightly by appro-\nximately 1.4% from 728 at the end of 2020 to 718 as at 31 December 2021. This reflects the\nreduced headcount resulting from the restructuring of the APEVA Group, which was offset by\na significant increase in AIXTRON SE's headcount due to the continued strong growth of the\nGroup's core business. As in previous years, the majority of employees are located in Europe.\n70\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCustomers and Geographic Regions\nAIXTRON’s customers span the power electronics, optoelectronics, and display industries.\nFor example, they manufacture high-performance semiconductor devices for applications in\nIT infrastructure, consumer electronics, power generation, and for use in the field of electro-\nmobility. In the optoelectronics sector, they manufacture lasers for data transmission, consu-\nmer electronics and automotive applications, among others. Customers in the display indus-\ntry, on the other hand, focus among other things on the manufacture of new types of LEDs\n(Mini and Micro LED) to address displays of all sizes, from smartwatches to large-area display\npanels. Some of these customers are vertically integrated device manufacturers who serve\nthe entire value chain as far as the end consumer. Others are independent manufacturers\nof components or epitaxial wafers who deliver the products made on AIXTRON equipment\nto the next link in the value chain, namely, the electronic device manufacturers. The Com-\npany’s customers also include research centers and universities, which particularly promote\nresearch into new types of materials.\nAIXTRON’s products are distributed worldwide. The market segments vary regionally. Most\nof the world’s leading electronic device manufacturers produce in Asia and consequently, the\nmajority of AIXTRON's sales continue to be delivered into this region.\nSee also “Development of Revenues” in this report for a breakdown of revenues by region.\nObjectives and Strategies\nWith the development, manufacture, distribution and maintenance of thin film deposition\nsystems for complex materials, AIXTRON addresses growing future markets along a variety of\nend-user applications, such as consumer electronics, automotive, telecommunications, and\npower generation.\n71\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAs a technology leader in the field of these complex deposition processes, AIXTRON's stra-\ntegy is to optimally address each of the many different and rapidly growing end markets\nthrough a clear focus on its core competencies, and to reinvest the earnings for the develop-\nment of further promising future applications.\nTechnology Portfolio for Complex Material Deposition\n72\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nscinortceleotpO\n/\nsDEL\nPower\nManagement\nLaser (VCSEL/EEL) GaN Power | GaAs/GaN RF\n(e.g. Optical Datacom, (e.g. Wireless Charging,\n3D Sensing; LiDAR) Fast Charging, IT Power Supply, 5G)\nAIXTRON\nMOCVD Core Technologies\nLEDs\nSiC Power\n(e.g. Fine Pitch-, Mini LED-Displays,\n(e.g. Electric Vehicles,\nIndoor Farming; Purification,\nCharging Stations, Infrastructure)\nnext-gen Micro LED-Displays)\nIt is our objective to secure and further expand our market position in the addressed focus\nmarkets in the long term through innovation and technology leadership, and to access adja-\ncent markets by leveraging our core competencies. The sustainability of the business, increa-\nsing revenues and profitability are the focus of our strategic planning.\nThe core of AIXTRONs strategy is to diversify its fields of application while maintaining its\nfocus on AIXTRON’s core competencies. The targeting of applications and markets that are\nattractive to AIXTRON in terms of size, growth, profitability and differentiation potential is\ncurrently very successful. This is because these applications from different industries, such as\nconsumer electronics, IT infrastructure and electromobility, are subject to growth dynamics\nthat are largely independent of one another. Thus, AIXTRON does not depend on only one\nsingle segment but strives to be robust against fluctuations in individual application mar-\nkets across the entire range of applications. To this end, AIXTRON actively develops a broad\ntechnology portfolio through in-house or sponsored developments, through collaborations,\nor through targeted acquisitions. The process of maintaining and developing technology\necosystems in close cooperation with customers and, where applicable, their customers or\ntechnology partners, allows AIXTRON to establish new technologies and open up new appli-\ncations.\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON focuses on markets where the use of AIXTRON technology allows for a clear dif-\nferentiation from competitors and thus creates value added for customers. These include,\namong other things, achieving high yields on the wafer by realizing high uniformity of the\nphysical properties of the deposited layers while simultaneously maintaining high through-\nput, low material and maintenance costs. An essential differentiating factor is the high pro-\nductivity and cost efficiency of our systems, e. g. through high throughput of the systems\nthanks to the so-called batch reactor, in which several wafers can be produced simultaneous-\nly, or through the reactor architecture-related efficiency of material usage. Markets with not\nenough potential for technical differentiation offer only low margins.\nAIXTRON pursues a platform strategy with its AIX 2800G4 and AIX G5 and AIX G5 WW families\nof systems that are based on the planetary concept. With a high proportion of identical parts,\nthe systems can be configured according to customer’s specification. As outlined in the pre-\nvious section, this allows for a broad diversification and the addressing of numerous applica-\ntions. In addition to the AIX 2800G4, AIX G5 and AIX G5 WW system families, which address\ncustomers with high production volumes, AIXTRON sells a showerhead-based system series,\nto universities and niche markets. This allows AIXTRON to come into contact with emerging\napplications at an early stage and to understand customer needs in new markets.\nOur OLED-subsidiary APEVA was initially restructured in the second quarter of 2021 and fo-\ncused on the Chinese market. However, as customers in this market are also opting for Micro\nLED as the technological basis for the development of the next generation of displays even\nfaster than originally expected, the shareholders of APEVA have decided not to invest further\nand to wind up the APEVA Group.\nControl System\nSince the various activities of the Group are largely integrated from an operational perspec-\ntive, management by means of performance indicators is carried out by the Executive Board\nof AIXTRON SE at Group level. The Executive Board's development projections for the Group\ntherefore also apply to AIXTRON SE.\n73\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nThe most relevant performance indicators for the AIXTRON Group are order intake, revenu-\nes, gross margin and earnings before interest and taxes relative to revenues (EBIT margin).\nThey are determined monthly in the AIXTRON reporting system and made available to ma-\nnagement in a comprehensive report. This enables the Executive Board to identify growth\ndrivers at an early stage, to analyze developments during the year and take prompt counter-\nmeasures in the event of any discernible deviations.\nAIXTRON aims to achieve organic revenue growth, exchange rate effects are excluded when\nsetting revenue targets. Order intake reflects the investment behavior of our customers and\nthus serves as an early indicator for revenues. The period between receipt and delivery of an\norder for an MOCVD system is generally between six and eight months.\nGross margin, which expresses gross profit in relation to sales, provides information on the\nprofitability and return on investment of AIXTRON’s operating business. The EBIT margin is\nused as an additional important indicator for operational management and analysis of the\nearnings situation.\nNon-financial Performance Indicators\nSince the introduction of the new Executive Board remuneration system in fiscal year 2020,\nAIXTRON has defined annual sustainability targets for the Executive Board as part of the Long\nTerm Incentive (LTI), which are to be achieved over a three-year reference period, and inclu-\ndes corresponding non-financial performance indicators in the Group management.\nThe following non-financial performance indicators have been defined for the LTI reference\nperiods 2020 to 2022 and 2021 to 2023 starting in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 respectively:\n• AIXTRON Group’s energy consumption\n(measured in kWh standardized to the most important consumption drivers)\n• the further training of AIXTRON Group’s employees\n(measured in hours of training completed)\nNew non-financial performance indicators have been defined for the LTI reference period\nstarting in fiscal year 2022. Essentially these are:\n• Proportion of environmentally sustainable sales revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx)\nand operating expenses (OpEx) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n74\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe adoption of the new sustainability criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the Exe-\ncutive Board's LTI-performance in fiscal year 2022 is intended to ensure the environmental\nsustainability of the company's activities, particularly in light of the expected growth of the\ncompany. The non-financial performance indicators defined for the LTI-tranches starting in\n2020 and 2021 become secondary with the introduction of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and\nare no longer considered essential for the implementation of the corporate strategy. Never-\ntheless, management continues to attach great importance to improving these performance\nindicators also in the medium and long term.\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nIn addition to the R&D center at its headquarters in Herzogenrath, AIXTRON also operates\na R&D laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. These in-house laboratories are equipped\nwith AIXTRON systems and are used to research and develop new equipment, materials and\nprocesses for the production of semiconductor structures.\nFocus on Innovation\nThe Group's R&D activities in 2021 again included development programs for future techno-\nlogies and new products, as well as continuous improvement of AIXTRON's existing products.\nIn order to increase industrial maturity and repeatability, products were optimized along the\nentire value chain as well as maintenance intervals were optimized via strategic approaches,\ne.g. through design improvements of externally supplied components or through improved\ndata analysis. In addition, AIXTRON is working on customer-specific development projects\nand researching new technologies, often in the context of publicly funded projects.\nThe Group’s R&D capability remains of important strategic significance, as it provides for a\ncompetitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the future business develop-\nment. Therefore, AIXTRON is committed to investing specifically in research and develop-\nment projects to retain or to expand the Company’s leading technology position in MOCVD\nequipment for applications such as lasers, Micro LEDs, specialty LEDs and for the production\nof wide-band-gap materials for power electronics. In addition, the Group is working on novel\n2D-nanostructures, which are seen as having great potential in research in line with inter-\nnational predictions (roadmaps).\nFor the consistent technological evolution of our product portfolio, we have invested EUR 56.8\nmillion, or around 13% of revenues ((2020: with 58.4 Mio. EUR aprox. 22%), in research and\ndevelopment (R&D) in 2021. At year-end 2021, 223 of AIXTRON Group’s total 718 employees\nwere engaged in research and development activities (2020: 254 of 728 employees).\n75\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nTechnology protection through patents\nAIXTRON aims to secure its technology by patenting and protecting inventions, provided it is\nstrategically expedient for the Company to do so. As of December 31, 2021, the Group had\n269 (thereof AIXTRON SE: 243) patent families available (December 31, 2020: 274 patent fa-\nmilies). For 9 patent families (AIXTRON SE: 7), patent protection was applied. Usually, patent\nprotection for inventions is applied for in those markets relevant to AIXTRON, specifically in\nEurope, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. AIXTRON's patent portfolio\nis evaluated annually and adjusted accordingly. The individual patents expire between 2022\nand 2041. In addition, AIXTRON continuously performs a worldwide patent analysis in order\nto identify and assess changes in the competitive environment at an early stage.\nResearch projects 2021\nAIXTRON is working on targeted research projects in areas that are considered to have\ngrowth potential in the future. The “MOCVD 4.2” project aimed to increase the production\nsuitability of our technology for applications in power electronics in particular, as well as in\nphotonics and sensor technology. An improvement in MOCVD-technology and effectiveness\nwas achieved to meet the international requirements of a versatile, highly flexible key tech-\nnology with frequently changing customer requirements, processes, products and material\nsystems. The project was successfully completed in December 2021. The “MehrSi” research\nproject to increase yield in solar cells was also successfully completed in 2021 with all key\nproject targets achieved. Thus, a central stage in the development of economic solutions for\nthe industrial use of multi-junction solar cells for power generation was reached. Initial re-\nsults are available for our “AdaptAR” research project, in which an augmented reality system\nwith a digital twin as a data basis is being developed, and our 2D Experimental Pilot Line “2D-\nEPL” initiative as part of the European Commission's “Graphene Flagship” project is running\naccording to plan and with great promise. A new facility has been constructed here and is\ncurrently under construction.\nExamples of the Group's research work include the “NeuroSys”, “OIP4NWE” and “AIIR-Po-\nwer”, on which AIXTRON worked intensively in 2021:\nAs a partner of the future cluster \"NeuroSys - Neuromorphic Hardware for Autonomous\nArtificial Intelligence Systems\", AIXTRON is responsible for building and optimizing the ne-\ncessary MOCVD systems for the new application. \"NeuroSys\" researches adaptive and ener-\ngy-efficient neuromorphic AI chips with the aim of enabling intelligent and resource-efficient\non-site data processing, thus creating an essential prerequisite for artificial intelligence (AI)\napplications. This is considered the key to the widespread use of AI, especially in autonomous\nvehicles, medical technology and sensor networks for intelligent production or urban regi-\nons. Very thin layers of novel 2D materials, only a few atomic layers thick, are needed as the\nmaterial basis for the neuromorphic chips. The production of these materials on the largest\npossible wafers is AIXTRON's core competence. As part of this and other projects, AIXTRON\nwill develop the world's most powerful technology platform for the industrial production of\nthese materials and operate it in its laboratory in Herzogenrath.\n76\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe project “OIP4NWE - Open-Innovation Photonics pilot for NWE” is researching Integra-\nted Photonics together with TU Eindhoven. This new technology has the potential to revo-\nlutionize communication technology, medical diagnostics and measurement technologies. A\nnewly developed automated MOCVD reactor for optimal layer quality and with high produc-\ntivity is now available for research and pilot production of optoelectronic integrated circuits\nin Eindhoven.\nThe “AIIR-Power” project, newly launched in 2020, aims to develop AI techniques to opti-\nmize optoelectronic device designs and their epitaxial fabrication, and apply them to rea-\nlize PPCs (photonic power converters) for telecom wavelengths. Ubiquitous digitalization,\nautomation, and the Internet of Things require constant power and data flows. With the\nemerging technology of photonic power transfer, also known as \"power by light,\" power and\ndata transfer can be combined in a single optical link, enabling electrically isolated, interfe-\nrence-free remote operation. By using optical telecommunication wavelengths, the potential\napplications of such power-by-light systems can be extended to new remote locations not\npreviously considered, and unlimited remote power can be provided. The unique capabilities\nof the project partners from Canada and Germany create synergies that would be inaccessi-\nble to either subgroup alone.\n77\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Economic Position\nGlobal Economy\nAs a manufacturer of capital goods, AIXTRON may be affected by the development of the\ngeneral economic environment, as this could impact its own suppliers, manufacturing costs,\nand sales opportunities, driven by the customers' willingness to invest.\nIn 2021, the global economy recovered significantly from the COVID-19-related slump of the\nprevious year. On the one hand, this is thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines that are now availa-\nble. On the other hand, the recovery of the global economy has been supported by further\nfiscal policy measures, particularly in the US. At the same time, the recovery is taking place at\ndifferent speeds - depending, for example, on the uneven distribution of vaccines, national\nfiscal and monetary policy options, or the different extent of the pandemic-related burden\non the individual economies, e. g. predominantly production versus tourism-oriented orien-\ntations. For example, the economies of China and the USA, which are particularly important\nfor AIXTRON, have recovered from the crisis much faster than many other countries. Howe-\nver, in the second half of the year, the recovery was partially slowed down by pandemic-re-\nlated supply bottlenecks and sharply rising raw material prices. In addition, the development\nremains subject to numerous uncertainties. These include in particular the global progress\nof the vaccination programs, the inflation trend, which poses a difficult task for monetary\npolicy in particular, and also the employment trend, which is not keeping pace. Overall, in the\nJanuary 2022 update of its World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nsees global economic output growing by 5.9% in 2021, following a 3.1% decline in 2020. The\ngrowth rate for the industrialized nations is 5.0% (2020: -4.5%), while the growth rate for\nthe emerging and developing countries is 6.5% (2020: -2.0%). Meanwhile, world trade grew\nby 9.3% (2020: -8.2%). Correspondingly, the strongly export-oriented German mechanical\nand plant engineering sector also developed positively. According to reports by the German\nEngineering Federation (Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau e. V. / VDMA)1, the\nsector recorded a real increase in order intake of 33% in the first eleven months of the year.\nOrders from abroad increased by 41%, while domestic orders rose by 18%. Overall, the trend\nleveled off over time, as the economy continues to perform well but catch-up effects have\nnow been worked off.\n1) VDMA, Order Intake in Mechanical Engineering: Eastern Germany and Germany, November 2021\n78\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe demand for AIXTRON products continues to be largely dependent on industry-specific\ndevelopments, such as the introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, IT in-\nfrastructure, electromobility, or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor mar-\nket, which continued to be very robust overall - also due to the trend towards digitalization,\nwhich was reinforced by the pandemic. In addition, AIXTRON can continuously rely on a sta-\nble and uninterrupted supply chain.\nExpectations about the US Federal Reserve Bank's (Fed's) future interest rate policy had a\nmajor influence on the development of the US dollar exchange rate in 2021. Accordingly,\nthe exchange rate reacted strongly to many news, be it inflation rates or bond yields, which\npointed to an approaching end of the loose monetary policy. While the US dollar traded in a\nrelatively narrow range around the 1.20 USD/EUR mark in the first half of the year, it gained\nsteadily in value in the second half of the year as inflationary pressure increased. The US dol-\nlar closed the year at 1.1372 USD/EUR on December 31, 2021 (2020: 1.2232 USD/EUR), thus\nstrengthening by 7% overall. AIXTRON applied an average USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.19\nUSD/EUR in fiscal year 2021 (Q1/2021: 1.22 USD/EUR; Q2/2021: 1.20 USD/EUR; Q3/2021:\n1.18 USD/EUR; Q4/2021: 1.15 USD/EUR). On average for the year, the exchange rate was\nthus just above the previous year's average (2020: 1.14 USD/EUR). Compared to the previ-\nous year, this had a correspondingly negative impact on the Group’s US-dollar-denominated\nrevenues.\nThe AIXTRON Management continues to carefully monitor the developments of the global\neconomy and the financial markets to decide what can potentially be done to mitigate ne-\ngative exogenous effects on AIXTRON’s business. In 2021, no forward exchange contracts\nor other hedging transactions were entered into. As of December 31, 2021, no currency\nhedging contracts were in place. The Executive Board reserves the right to carry out hedging\ntransactions in the future, should this be deemed appropriate.\nCompetitive Positioning\nCompetitors in the market for CVD/MOCVD equipment are Veeco Instruments, Inc. (USA,\n“Veeco”), Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan, “TNS”), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan, “TEL”), Advanced\nMicro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. (China, “AMEC”), Tang Optoelectronics Equipment Corpo-\nration Limited (China, “TOPEC”) as well as LPE (Italy) and Nuflare Technology Inc. (Japan,\n“Nuflare”). Other companies are also continuing to try to qualify their own MOCVD-systems\nwith their customers. For example, Technology Engine of Science Co. Ltd. (South Korea,\n“TES”), Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical (China, “JSG”) and HERMES Epitek (Taiwan, “HER-\nMES”) are working on the development of their own MOCVD system solutions and are trying\nto establish them in the market.\nBased on the published financial results of competitors and own estimates, AIXTRON sees\n79\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nits global market leadership for MOCVD equipment in 2020 confirmed. AIXTRON thus holds\nthe top position for the fifth year in a row: accordingly, AIXTRON's market share amounted to\n58%, followed by Veeco (USA) with 26% and AMEC (China) with 16%. At the same time, the\nglobal market for MOCVD equipment decreased slightly in 2020 compared to the previous\nyear, totaling USD 438 million (2019: USD 488 million). For fiscal year 2021, no current mar-\nket share figures from independent market analysts are yet available.\nKey Target Markets\nMarket for power semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials\ngallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC)\nPower semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials are one of the main appli-\ncations of AIXTRON's deposition technology. These materials enable the production of very\ncompact and highly efficient power supplies and AC/DC as well as DC/DC converters. They\nare therefore increasingly used in a wide range of applications that can cover a wide power\nrange. WBG power semiconductors reduce conversion losses by up to 50% and thus contri-\nbute significantly to increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. There are two\nmain groups of WBG power semiconductors: GaN (gallium nitride) and SiC (silicon carbide).\nMarket for gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors\nGaN semiconductor devices are used primarily in the low and medium power and voltage\nclasses, such as in power supplies for smartphones and laptops, and in power supplies for\nservers and other IT infrastructure. GaN semiconductor devices had achieved significant vo-\nlume in the market for the first time in 2020 and have since seen rapid growth, particularly\nin fiscal 2021. Customers are continuously tapping into new applications, for example in the\nfield of micro inverters in the photovoltaic sector or on-board chargers in the field of elec-\ntromobility. In addition, the customer base for AIXTRON's GaN semiconductor equipment is\ncontinuously expanding, while existing customers are increasing their production capacities.\nDue to the wide range of applications, Yole Développement (Yole) analysts expect the market\nfor GaN power semiconductors to grow very strongly, from USD 46 million in 2020 to USD 1.1\nbillion in 2026, corresponding to a compound annual growth rate (CGAR) of 70% between\n2020 and 2026.\n80\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFurthermore, GaN semiconductor devices are increasingly used in high-frequency applica-\ntions. In 5G telecommunication networks and - likely - in subsequent network generations\nsuch as 6G, the advantage of GaN technology of lower power losses at high frequencies will\ncome into play. As a result, more and more manufacturers are switching their production of\nhigh-frequency switches from silicon to GaN. Yole analysts expect the market for GaN high-\nfrequency semiconductor devices to grow from USD 891 million in 2020 to USD 2.4 billion in\n2026 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%.\nMarket for silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors\nWBG power components made of silicon carbide (SiC) also continued their growth course in\n2021. They are particularly suitable for use in higher power and voltage classes. Fields of ap-\nplication are primarily electric vehicles and their fast charging stations, but also converters in\nthe field of photovoltaics and wind energy and other electric drives. In these applications, SiC\nenables a significant reduction in conversion losses, resulting in a greater range per battery\ncharge in vehicles and a higher amount of energy delivered in the power generation sector.\nDriven by significantly increased awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and CO2\nreduction, both in the regulatory and private sectors, vehicle manufacturers worldwide have\nraised their targets for powertrain electrification. This trend is increasingly accelerated by\nthe push in numerous states to set specific dates for a halt in registrations or sales of new\nvehicles with internal combustion engines.\nBased on this trend, Yole forecasts that the SiC device market will grow from under USD 1.1\nbillion currently to USD 4.4 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 32%. According to the analysts, this\nis particularly due to the development of electric cars and the corresponding fast charging\ninfrastructure.\n81\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLED Market\nRed, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) are used in Mini LED displays, among other things,\nin large-format color displays for sports stadiums, airports and shopping malls, as well as in\nautomotive taillights or for indoor farming. In addition, televisions and monitors in the premi-\num segment are increasingly being equipped with Mini LEDs for backlighting. The market for\ninfrared and ROY LED manufacturing equipment is expected to double from 2020 to 2025,\nreaching USD 108 million (Epitaxy Growth Equipment for More than Moore Devices Report,\nYole, 2020). According to Yole, the demand for the global area of direct-emitting, large-area\nLED display walls is growing at an average rate of 63% per year between 2017 and 2024.\nThe market for UV LEDs (Ultra-Violet Light Emitting Diodes) is another specialized segment\nin the LED market that AIXTRON addresses. UV LEDs are used for curing plastics and disinfec-\nting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking) water. Due to the increasing demand for hygiene,\nthis market is expected to gain importance in the future. According to LEDinside (Deep UV\nLED Application Market and Branding Strategies, LEDinside 2020), the market for UV LEDs\nis expected to grow at a high rate from USD 310 million in 2020 to USD 1.4 billion in 2025,\nrepresenting an annual growth rate of 35%.\nMarket for Micro LEDs\nAccording to LEDinside, the greatest growth potential in the field of LEDs is the market for\nMicro LEDs. Analysts expect Micro LEDs to be used initially in very small displays such as\nsmartwatches and very large displays such as large-screen premium TVs. In the long term,\nother potential applications include displays in smartphones, tablets and notebooks. LED\ntechnology is currently still in the early stages of development, so estimates of future market\nsize by various analysts diverge widely. For example, LEDinside predicts the Micro LED market\nto grow from USD 318 million in 2020 to USD 2.9 billion in 2025. As Micro LED technology\nmatures, AIXTRON expects the currently still very young market for Micro LEDs to differen-\ntiate both technically and commercially.\n82\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMarket for lasers-based optical data transmission\nThe volume of data transmitted via fiber optic cable continues to grow exponentially, driven\nby the increasing use of cloud computing and Internet services. Especially the growing use\nof video-on-demand, as well as the communication of networked devices via the Internet\n(“Internet of Things”) contribute to increasing data volumes. In addition to the data volumes,\nthe enormously fast transmission at the speed of light for optical data transmission also plays\na major role. Lasers, which are manufactured on AIXTRON equipment, are key components\nfor high-speed optical data transmission. The growth in global data traffic due to mobile\ntelecommunications, the switch to 5G standards, and data transfer via optical fibers inc rease\nthe demand for lasers as optical signal generators, photodiodes as receivers, and optical\namplifiers and switches.\nMarket research firms such as Yole and Strategies Unlimited expect investment in laser- based\ncommunications to continue to increase to accommodate growing data traffic. For this rea-\nson, market research firm Yole predicts that revenues from transceivers used in telecommu-\nnications will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14% from 2020 to 2025. The total\nmarket volume in 2025 is forecast by Yole to exceed USD 20.9 billion.\nLaser-based 3D Sensor Market\nLaser-based 3D sensors are often used in high-end mobile phones. Since this technology\nwas introduced to the market with the iPhone X in 2017, Apple has been using it in its third-\ngeneration smartphones and is now also using it in its tablet series. In addition, more and\nmore mobile phone manufacturers are equipping their models with 3D sensors. With these\nsensors, the environment can be captured in three dimensions, which is important for many\napplications, e. g. augmented reality. Consumer electronics, for example, will be the main\ndemand driver for laser-based 3D sensors in the next few years, according to market research\ncompany Yole. Yole expects surface emitting lasers to grow from USD 1.2 billion in 2021 to\nUSD 2.4 billion in 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 13.5%.\nIn addition to consumer electronics applications, edge and surface emitting lasers are in-\ncreasingly being used in the industrial and automotive sectors for 3D sensing. Yole expects\na strong increase in demand for these components by 2026, especially from the automotive\nindustry, as an element for distance measurement in driver assistance systems and in auto-\nnomous vehicles (LiDAR).\n83\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Development\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on the world economy\nand global supply chains in fiscal year 2021. However, through early initiated and consist-\nently applied protective measures, this had only a minor impact on AIXTRON’s workforce.\nAIXTRON was also able to effectively mitigate the strain in the global supply chains through\nearly implemented countermeasures, resulting in revenue growth of 59% in 2021. Accor-\ndingly, we again met our guidance issued in February 2021 and increased during the year in\nall key performance indicators without exception.\nIn particular, a strong increase in demand for AIXTRON’s Gallium Nitride (GaN) power device\nproduction equipment characterized the reporting year. AIXTRON’s other products also expe-\nrienced strong demand in 2021, for example, systems for the production of lasers for optical\ndata communication and 3D sensing, systems for LEDs, and increasingly systems for Micro\nLEDs. Customer demand also increased for equipment to manufacture energy-efficient pow-\ner electronics based on silicon carbide (SiC), as well as for equipment to manufacture com-\nponents for wireless telecommunications. With orders totaling EUR 497.3 million (2020: EUR\n301.4 million), we recorded the highest order volume since 2011 in fiscal year 2021. As ex-\npected, revenues also developed very positively and, at EUR 429.0 million (2020: EUR 269.2\nmillion), were in line with the forecast given and also reached the highest level since 2011. At\n42%, the gross margin achieved was slightly above expectations, mainly due to the strong in-\ncrease in the USD exchange rate in the 4th quarter. The increased operating expenses of EUR\n82.5 million included higher variable compensation components as well as one-time expen-\nses for our subsidiary APEVA in the amount of EUR 3.9 million. The operating result was EUR\n99.0 million with an EBIT margin of 23% (2020: EUR 34.8 million; 13%). This resulted in a net\nprofit of EUR 94.8 million (2020: EUR 34.5 million). Free cash flow (cash flow from operating\nactivities adjusted for changes in financial assets - investments + proceeds from disposals) of\nEUR 48.7 million (2020: EUR 14.0 million) was reported for the financial year 2021.\nIn the year 2021, AIXTRON has been actively pursuing the renewal of its product portfolio.\nThe next generation of systems in the GaN power electronics, SiC power electronics and laser\n/ Micro LED market segments have made great progress in development and are currently\nundergoing trials with first customers. In addition, we have won further well-known custo-\nmers such as Bosch and Nexperia for our equipment technology for the efficient large-scale\nproduction of high-performance silicon carbide power electronics.\nOur OLED subsidiary APEVA was initially restructured in the second quarter of 2021 and fo-\ncused on the Chinese market. However, as customers in this market are also opting for Micro\nLED as the technological basis for the development of the next generation of displays even\nfaster than originally expected, the shareholders of APEVA have decided not to make any\nfurther investments in APEVA , to wind up the APEVA Group and to recognize corresponding\nimpairment losses.\n84\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIn order to achieve a sustainable profitable development of the AIXTRON Group in the future,\nour product portfolio focuses exclusively on product lines with a positive earnings contribu-\ntion or those that promise a significant return on investment (ROI) in the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n2021 2020 2021-2020\nEUR million EUR million in EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 497.3 301.4 195.8 65\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 214.6 150.9 63.7 42\nIn the fiscal year 2021 US dollar-based order intake and order backlog have been recorded\nat the budget exchange rate of 1.25 USD/EUR (2020: 1.20 USD/EUR). Spares & service orders\nare not included in the order backlog.\nIn 2021, total order intake including spares & services stood at EUR 497.3 million, thus signi-\nficantly higher than the previous year’s figure. This development was driven in particular by\ncontinuously strong demand from the fields of power electronics, optical data communica-\ntion and LEDs. In Q4/2021, order intake at EUR 119.7 million was up 5% against the previous\nquarter (Q3/2021: EUR 114.2 million).\nAt EUR 214.6 million, the equipment order backlog as of December 31, 2021, was also hig-\nher than the order backlog of EUR 150.9 million at the end of 2020 (2021 budget rate: 1.25\nUSD/EUR; 2020 budget rate: 1.20 USD/EUR). Compared to the end of the previous quarter,\nthe order backlog decreased due to the high number of shipments in the fourth quarter by\n20% at year-end (September 30, 2021: EUR 267.6 million).\n85\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIn line with strict internal procedures, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be\nmet for the recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These conditi-\nons include the following requirements:\n1 the receipt of a firm written purchase order,\n2 the receipt or securing of the agreed down payment,\n3. accessibility to the required shipping documentation,\n4. a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Management Board re-\nserves the right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is sufficiently\nlikely to occur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, Management comes to the\nconclusion that the realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or involves an unaccep-\ntable degree of risk, Management will exclude this specific order or a portion of this order\nfrom the recorded order intake and order backlog figures until the risk has decreased to an\nacceptable level. The order backlog is regularly assessed and – if necessary – adjusted in line\nwith potential execution risks.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nRevenues in fiscal year 2021 amounted to EUR 429.0 million and were thus about 59% higher\nthan in the previous year (2020: EUR 269.2 million). EUR 62.4 million or 15% of revenues in\nfiscal year 2021 were generated from the sale of spare parts and services. In total, revenues\nwith MOCVD systems rose by around 64% year-on-year. In particular, the strong increase in\ndemand for MOCVD equipment for the production of GaN power devices led to a doubling of\nequipment sales in the power electronics segment. The optoelectronics business also grew,\ndriven in particular by continued strong demand from the optical data transmission sector\nfor fiber optic networks. Due to demand, particularly from the field of LED displays, and in-\nitial demand from the field of Micro LEDs, AIXTRON also grew in this segment. The revenue\nshares developed as follows: Power electronics contributed 38% of equipment revenues,\nfollowed by optoelectronics with 37% and specialty LEDs with 23%.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n2021 2020 2021-2020\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 366.5 85 223.0 83 143.5 64\nService, spare parts, etc. 62.4 15 46.2 17 16.2 35\nTotal 429.0 100 269.2 100 159.7 59\n86\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAt EUR 299.9 million, demand from customers in Asia continued to account for the majority\nof total revenues in 2021.

In absolute terms, operating\nexpenses increased from EUR 73.5 million in the year 2020 to EUR 82.5 million in the past\nfiscal year. Contributing to the increase in operating expenses were higher variable remune-\nration components. Furthermore, additional restructuring expenses and other non-recurring\nexpenses for APEVA in the total amount of approximately EUR 3.9 million were incurred. EUR\n3.2 million of these expenses had been recognized in Q2 2021 in connection with the re-\nalignment to the Chinese market. Due to the faster than expected orientation of customers\ntowards Micro LED also in this market and the resulting decision not to invest further in APEVA\nand to wind up the group, further depreciation and other expenses in the amount of EUR\n0.7 million were incurred. In the previous year, a special effect due to a change of use for a\nproduction facility had led to other operating income in the amount of EUR 2.9 million.\nThe following individual effects must be taken into account:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were higher in a year-on-year comparison at\nEUR 35.4 million (2020: EUR 27.7 million). Relative to revenues, selling, general and adminis-\ntrative expenses amounted to 8% (2020: 10%). The development was mainly attributable to\nhigher variable remuneration.\nResearch and development expenses, including expenses for OLED development activities,\ndecreased slightly by 3% year-on-year to EUR 56.8 million. This is mainly due to a reduction\nin development expenses for OLED technology, which was offset only to a lesser extent by an\nincrease in the development expenses for next-generation MOCVD equipment.\nKey R&D Information\n2021 2020 2021-2020\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 56.8 58.4 -3%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 13 22\nNet other operating income and expenses in 2021 resulted in an income of EUR 9.7 million\n(2020: income of EUR 12.6 million). The high positive figure for the previous year was signi-\nficantly influenced by the above-mentioned special effect from the reversal of impairment\nlosses due to the change of use of a production facility (EUR 2.9 million).\nOther operating income includes grants for publicly funded development projects amoun-\nting to EUR 8.9 million (2020: EUR 8.1 million). In fiscal year 2021, a net foreign exchange\ngain of EUR 1.2 million (2020: EUR 0.8 million loss) was recorded from transactions in foreign\ncurrencies and the translation of balance sheet items.\n88\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAt EUR 79.3 million, personnel costs in fiscal year 2021 were 20% higher than the EUR 66.1\nmillion in 2020. This increase was mainly due to higher variable expenses and the above-\nmentioned restructuring charges.\nOperating Result (EBIT)\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved year-on-year by 184% and amounted to EUR 99.0 mil-\nlion in the fiscal year 2021 (2020: EUR 34.8 million). This resulted in EBIT margin of 23%\n(2020: 13%). This development is mainly due to the year-on-year increase in revenues and\nthe related gross margin and is thus attributable to the business and cost development de-\nscribed above. Further details are provided in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in\nthe consolidated financial statements on page 120.\nResult before Tax\nProfit before tax at EUR 98.9 million in 2021 was clearly higher than in the previous year\n(2020: EUR 35.1 million).

This includes income from the capitalization of deferred taxes on loss\ncarryforwards in the amount of EUR 9.6 million due to expected future profits.\nConsolidated net income for the year\nThe AIXTRON Group's consolidated net income in fiscal year 2021 was EUR 94.8 million, or\n22% of revenues (2020: EUR 34.5 million or 13%).\n89\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAssets and Liabilities\nThe Balance Sheet Total as of 31 December 2021 increased year-on-year to EUR 740.7 million\n(December 31, 2020: EUR 590.4 million). The complete consolidated statement of financial\nposition can be found in the consolidated financial statements on page 122.\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from EUR 63.5 million as of 31 December 2020\nto EUR 74.0 million as of 31 December 2021 due to increased investments, particularly in\nlaboratory plant and equipment.\nGoodwill was EUR 72.3 million compared to EUR 71.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe difference is completely due to exchange rate fluctuations. No impairment losses were\nrecognized. Further information on goodwill is provided in Note 12 \"Intangible assets\" in the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther intangible assets decreased to EUR 2.2 million as of 31 December 2021 (31 December\n2020: EUR 2.9 million), as depreciation was slightly higher than capital expenditures.\nInventories, including components and work in progress, increased by EUR 41.5 million year-\non-year to EUR 120.6 (December 31, 2020: EUR 79.1 million), indicating the high number of\ndeliveries planned in subsequent quarters. The inventory turnover rate at the end of 2021\nwas 2.0 (2020: 2.0).\nTrade receivables were EUR 81.0 million at December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020:\nEUR 41.3 million), reflecting the high volume of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2021. The\ncurrent days sales outstanding was 23 days at the end of 2021 compared to 18 days at the\nend of 2020.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets increased to EUR 352.5 million as of De-\ncember 31, 2021 (31. December 2020: EUR 309.7 million). The increase is mainly due to the\nhigher net income for the period. This is countered by offsetting effects from the build-up of\ninventories, mainly as a result of the higher business volume as well as from higher receiva-\nbles, due to a disproportionately strong revenue contribution in the last quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2021, other financial assets include fund investments of EUR 141.6 mil-\nlion (December 31, 2020: EUR 62.4 million), short-term bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million\n(December 31, 2020: EUR 0 million) and long-term bank deposits of EUR 0 million (December\n31, 2020: EUR 60.0 million). The non-current bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million included as\nof December 31, 2020 were reclassified to current financial assets in 2021. Please also refer\nto note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n90\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLiabilities\nTrade payables increased to EUR 19.6 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020:\nEUR 10.8 million), due to the increased procurement volume.\nProvisions (non-current and current) increased from EUR 20.2 million as of December 31,\n2020, to EUR 31.8 million as of December 31, 2021. This was due on the one hand to a high\nnumber of systems being shipped with associated provisions for warranties, and on the other\nhand to higher provisions for variable remuneration.\nAt EUR 77.0 million as of December 31, 2021, advance payments received from customers\nwere significantly above the previous year's level (December 31, 2020: EUR 50.8 million),\nreflecting the current positive order situation.\nOther current liabilities include payments received for publicly funded development pro-\njects and decreased slightly year-on-year to EUR 6.4 million (December 31, 2020: EUR 7.4\nmillion).\nFinancial Position\nPrincipals and Objectives of Financial Management\nAIXTRON has a central financial management system whose primary objective is to ensu-\nre the long-term financial strength of the Group. AIXTRONs financial management includes\nthe control of its global liquidity as well as its interest and currency management. Financial\nprocesses and responsibilities are defined throughout the Group. The investment policy is\napproved by the Supervisory Board.\nOur capital structure management aims to determine an appropriate capital structure for\neach company within the Group while minimizing costs and risks. An appropriate structure\nmust comply with tax, legal and commercial requirements. The Group increases or decreases\nthe capital in line with the strategic orientation of the companies.\nOur liquidity management aims to ensure the effective management of cash flows within\neach company of the group. The central finance department and local management monitor\nthe cash flows within the group on a daily basis and take corrective action where necessary.\nFinancing requirements are covered by cash within the group, either through intra-group\nloans or through changes in equity.\nThe principles of the investment policy are determined by the Executive Board and approved\nby the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE. Excess cash is invested by the finance department\nin accordance with this policy. The policy only allows for low-risk investments.\n91\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDue to its global business operations, AIXTRON generates a portion of its revenues in foreign\ncurrencies, i. e. in currencies other than the Euro. The most prevalent foreign currency rele-\nvant for AIXTRON is the US dollar. The associated exchange rate risk is monitored by the cen-\ntral finance department and taken into account as part of liquidity management. Speculative\nforeign currency trans-actions are not concluded.\nIn the semiconductor equipment industry, it is essential to have sufficient cash and cash\nequivalents at all times in order to be able to quickly finance possible business expansion.\nAIXTRON’s current cash requirements are generally covered by cash inflows from operating\nactivities. The Company can draw on a high level of cash and cash equivalents and other\nshort-term investments to secure further corporate financing and to support its indispensa-\nble research and development activities. In addition, AIXTRON has the option, if necessary\nand subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue financial instruments on the\ncapital market to cover additional capital requirements.\nFinancing\nThe equity ratio decreased slightly mainly due to the significantly increased advance pay-\nments from customers and the correspondingly higher balance sheet total compared to the\nprevious year and amounted to 80% as of December 31, 2021 compared to 84% as of De-\ncember 31, 2020.\nThe share capital of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 113,292,020 as of December 31, 2021\n(December 31, 2020: EUR 112,927,320). It is divided into 113,292,020 no-par value regis-\ntered common shares with a pro rata amount of share capital of EUR 1.00 per share. All\nshares are fully paid in. The increase in share capital is attributable to the shares issued in\nthe fiscal year under stock option programs. Please also refer to note 22 in the Notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn fiscal year 2021, 364,700 stock options from past stock option programs were exercised\n(2020: 0 options) and no new stock options were issued (2020: 0 options).

These investments include additional test\nand demonstration facilities as well as the expansion of production and development areas.\nA further EUR 1.3 million was invested in financial assets and intangible assets including soft-\nware licenses and other non-current financial assets (2020: EUR 1.4 million).\nFor fiscal year 2021, the cash flow statement showed a cash outflow from investing activi-\nties of EUR 0 million due to changes in time deposits with a maturity of at least three months\n(2020: outflow of EUR 32.5 million).\nAll investments in the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were funded out of available cash resources.\n93\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLiquidity and Cashflow\nEUR million\nDecember December\nDescription Balance sheet item 31, 2021 31, 2020 + / -\nBank deposits Cash and cash equivalents 150.9 187.3 -36.4\nShort-term bank deposits\nOther financial assets 60.0 0 +60.0\n(term of 3 to max. 12 months)\nFund investments Other financial assets 141.6 62.4 +79.2\nLong-term bank deposits\n(term of more than 12 Other financial assets 0.0 60.0 -60.0\nmonths)\nTotal liquidity 352.5 309.7 +42.8\nCash and cash equivalents including other financial assets increased to EUR 352.5 million\nas of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR 309.7 million). As of December 31, 2021,\nother financial assets included fund investments in the amount of EUR 141.6 million and,\nin addition, bank deposits, primarily in euros, with a maturity of less than twelve months in\nthe amount of EUR 60.0 million, which were reported under other non-current assets in the\nprevious year due to their maturity and were reclassified to current financial assets in the\nfinancial year (see also “Investments”).\nThere are no restrictions on access to the Company's cash and cash equivalents.\nMainly due to an increase in fund investments, cash flow from operating activities amoun-\nted to EUR -13.5 million in fiscal year 2021 (2020: EUR -39.2 million). Adjusted for this effect,\ncash flow amounted to EUR 66.4 million (2020: EUR 23.3 million). This is mainly the result\nof the increase in net income for the year. This was offset by the effects of the increase in\ninventories and the higher level of receivables as of the reporting date.\nCash flow from investing activities in the 2021 fiscal year was EUR -17.5 million (2020: EUR\n-41.5 million). This figure is mainly attributable to investments, above all in laboratory plant\nand equipment. In the previous year, cash flow from investing activities included changes in\nfixed-term deposits with a maturity of at least three months amounting to EUR -32.5 million\n(change in fixed-term deposits 2021: EUR 0.0 million; 2020: EUR -32.5 million). Adjusted for\nthe effect of changes in fixed-term deposits, cash flow from investing activities would have\nbeen EUR -9.0 million in 2020.\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -8.6 million in 2021 (2020: EUR -0.9\nmillion). The main drivers were the dividend payment of EUR -12.3 million (2020: EUR 0) and\ncash inflows from the issue of new shares under stock option programs of EUR 4.8 million\n(2020: EUR 0). In 2020, the cash outflow resulted mainly from repayments of lease liabilities.\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in financial assets\n- investments + proceeds from disposals) for the 2021 fiscal year was EUR 48.7 million com-\npared to EUR 14.0 million in 2020. The difference compared with the previous year is mainly\n94\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\ndue to the increase in net income for the year and higher trade receivables as of the balance\nsheet date.\nFinancial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators\nAIXTRON’s key performance indicators are order intake, revenues, gross margin and EBIT\nmargin. These form the basis for group-wide operational and strategic planning. They are\nused to pursue the goal of combining profitable revenue growth with cost and asset efficien-\ncy in order to achieve a sustainable increase in value. Thus, AIXTRON now focuses on four key\nperformance indicators for the Group.\nAs non-financial performance indicators, the proportions of environmentally sustainable re-\nvenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) as defined by the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation are used for internal corporate management.\nManagement Assessment of Company Situation\nIn fiscal year 2021, AIXTRON continued to focus on successfully addressing the targeted\ngrowth markets with sustainable profitability. At the same time, the Group continued to dri-\nve development and sales activities, particularly for power electronics equipment and for the\nproduction of Mini and Micro LED displays.\nEquipment revenues in 2021 amounted to EUR 366.5 million, of which EUR 139.7 million\n(38%) was generated by MOCVD/CVD equipment for the production of components for the\npower electronics segment (GaN/SiC) and EUR 137.0 million (37%) by MOCVD equipment\nfor the optoelectronics segment (laser, solar and telecom). Further fundamental growth is\nexpected in the aforementioned markets, as modern power electronics components are in-\ncreasingly made of silicon carbide or gallium nitride materials, and the use of lasers in the\nfields of optical data transmission and 3D sensor technology continues to increase.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned activities, there is a focus on the costs as well as the mar-\ngin contributions of individual revenue drivers. In addition, the Executive Board continuously\nreviews the product portfolio with a view to changing framework conditions, such as time\nwindows for the market launch of new technologies or evaluation of our customers' product\nrequirements.\nThe fiscal year 2021 developed very positively in all markets addressed by our core techno-\nlogy. Management expects further revenue growth in the future, driven by the megatrends\nof digitalization, electromobility, energy efficiency and climate protection.\nIn this context, the AIXTRON Group maintains a healthy financing structure with a high level\nof cash and cash equivalents and without any bank debt.\n95\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAchievement of guidance in 2021\nIn order to give our stakeholders including our shareholders the opportunity to follow our\nbusiness development, we regularly publish our guidance for the current year with the publi-\ncation of the annual report of the previous year.

The report is published in the Federal Gazette.\nThe annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE have been prepared in accordance with the\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The indivi-\ndual financial statements generally serve to determine the balance sheet profit and thus the\npossible distribution amount.\nThe combined management report comprises all legally required information regarding\nAIXTRON SE. In addition to the reporting on the AIXTRON Group we explain the development\nof AIXTRON SE.\nAIXTRON SE is the parent company of the AIXTRON Group and has its headquarters in Herzo-\ngenrath, Germany. The AIXTRON SE Management is responsible for key management func-\ntions for the Group, such as corporate strategy, risk management, investment management,\nexecutive and financial management, and communication with key target groups of the\nGroup. AIXTRON SE generates the majority of its consolidated revenues through its operating\nactivities of the development, production, sale and maintenance of equipment for the de-\nposition of semiconductor materials. In addition to seven directly or indirectly wholly owned\nsubsidiaries, which are primarily responsible for the worldwide distribution of AIXTRON's\nproducts, AIXTRON SE currently holds an 87% interest in the APEVA Group.\nAIXTRON SE is not managed separately using its own performance indicators because the\nCompany is integrated into the Group management. We refer here to the respective expla-\nnations provided for the Group. The economic framework conditions of AIXTRON SE are es-\nsentially the same as those of the AIXTRON Group and are described in detail in the chapter\nBusiness Report.\n97\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIncome Statement of AIXTRON SE according to HGB\nEUR million 2021 2020 2021-2020\nRevenues 396.2 250.2 146.0\nChanges in inventories 15.4 -6.0 21.4\nOther own work capitalized 0.5 0.2 0.3\nTotal output 412.1 244.4 167.7\nOther operating income 12.9 16.1 -3.2\nCost of materials 204.4 125.4 79.0\nPersonnel expenses 52.7 39.6 13.1\nDepreciation 7.6 10.7 -3.1\nOther operating expenses 61.0 57.9 3.1\nOperating result 99.3 27.0 72.3\nResult from investments 4.3 0.0 4.3\nNet interest income -0.9 0.0 -0.9\nFinancial result 3.4 0.0 3.4\nProfit before tax 102.7 27.0 75.7\nTaxes on income and earnings 12.9 2.9 10.0\nProfit after tax 89.9 24.1 65.7\nOther taxes 0.2 0.2 0.0\nNet profit for the year 89.7 23.9 65.7\nLoss (-)/profit carried forward (+) 18.4 -5.6 24.0\nDividend payment -12.3 0.0 -12.3\nTransfer to retained earnings -44.8 0.0 -44.8\nNet retained profit (+)/loss (-) 50.9 18.4 32.5\n98\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of operations of AIXTRON SE according to HGB\nAIXTRON SE’s revenues amounted to EUR 396.2 million in fiscal year 2021 and thus increased\nby EUR 146.0 million, or 58%, compared with the previous year (2020: EUR 250.2 million).\nRevenues were influenced by continued high demand for MOCVD systems in the fields of\nGaN power electronics, wireless and optical data communication as well as LED applications.\nThe other revenues are attributable to intra-Group charges.\nRevenues by category\n2021 2020 2021-2020\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 332.3 84 201.7 80 130.7 65\nService and spare parts 57.1 14 41.9 17 15.2 36\nOther revenues 6.7 2 6.7 3 0.1 1\nTotal 396.2 100 250.2 100 146.0 100\nAt 70%, demand from customers in Asia still accounted for the largest share of total revenues\nin 2021.\nRevenues by region\n2021 2020 2021-2020\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsian 277.7 70 182.2 73 95.5 52\nEurope 87.5 22 41.1 16 46.4 113\nAmericas 31.0 8 26.9 11 4.2 16\nTotal 396.2 100 250.2 100 146.0 58\nAt EUR 89.7 million (2020: EUR 23.9 million), the net result for the year was significantly\nhigher than in the previous year. The following factors contributed to this development:\nAt 50%, the cost of materials ratio (cost of materials in relation to total output) was slightly\nbelow the previous year’s figure (2020: 51%), mainly attributable to a more favorable pro-\nduct-mix.\nThe annual average number of employees at AIXTRON SE rose from 431 in the previous year\nto 477 in the fiscal year 2021. As result of the increased number of employees and variable\nremuneration components, personnel expenses increased from EUR 39.6 million in the pre-\nvious year to EUR 52.7 million in fiscal year 2021.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by EUR 3.1 million from EUR 10.7 million in 2020\nto EUR 7.6 million in 2021. In the previous year, higher depreciation due to shorter useful\nlives of some laboratory equipment had led to higher expenses.\n99\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOther operating expenses were higher at EUR 61.0 million compared to EUR 57.9 million\nin fiscal year 2020. The main drivers were higher variable expenses for shipped systems and\nexpenditures for the expansion of production capacities.\nIn comparison to 2020, other operating income decreased from EUR 16.1 million to EUR\n12.9 million in the 2021 fiscal year. This is mainly due to a one-off effect from the reversal\nof impairment losses due to the change in use of a production facility in the previous year.\nIn addition, a result from investments of EUR 4.3 million (2020: EUR 0) was generated in\nfiscal year 2021. This includes dividend income from subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 8.3\nmillion as well as an impairment loss on the investment in APEVA Holdings Ltd. in the amount\nof EUR 4.0 million, whose earnings prospects have permanently deteriorated due to the lack\nof customer interest.\nNet interest income totaled EUR -0.9 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to EUR 0 million\nin 2020. This is mainly attributable to expenses from the fair value measurement of fund\ninvestments.\nNet Result AIXTRON SE - Use of Result\nThe net income of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 89.7 million. An amount of EUR 44.8 mil-\nlion was transferred to retained earnings. Together with the profit carried forward from the\nprevious year in the amount of EUR 18.4 million and the dividend payment in May 2021 in\nthe amount of EUR 12.3 million, this results in a new accumulated profit of EUR 50.9 million\nas of December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR 18.4 million). The Management Board and Supervisory\nBoard will propose to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.30 per share\n(2020: EUR 0.11) be paid for 2021.\nAssets and Liabilities and Financial Position of AIXTRON SE\nAt EUR 615.6 million, total assets at AIXTRON SE at the end of 2020 were about 28% higher\nthan the previous year’s figure (2020: EUR 481.8 million). This was due in particular to advan-\nce payments received from customers and the positive net result for the year.\n100\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBalance Sheet of AIXTRON SE (HGB)\n2021 2020\nEUR million Dec. 31 Dec. 31\nAssets\nIntangible assets 2.2 2.6\nProperty, plant and equipment 63.8 56.4\nFinancial assets 46.4 50.1\nNon-current assets 112.4 109.1\nInventories 104.7 69.0\nTrade receivables 66.1 21.5\nReceivables from associates 15.8 15.1\nOther assets 6.6 3.4\nSecurities 141.6 62.4\nCash and credit balances at banks 167.7 200.8\nCurrent assets 502.5 372.2\nDeferred expenses and accrued income 0.7 0.6\nTotal assets 615.6 481.8\n2021 2020\nEUR million Dec. 31 Dec. 31\nEquity and liabilities\nSubscribed capital 113.3 112.9\nTreasury stock -1.1 -1.1\nIssued capital 112.2 111.8\nCapital reserve 280.8 276.3\nRetained earnings 44.8 0.0\nAccumulated deficit 50.9 18.4\nEquity 488.7 406.5\nProvisions 46.1 24.8\nPrepayments received on order 62.0 40.1\nTrade payables 12.9 5.8\nLiabilities from associates 2.9 1.0\nOther liabilities 3.1 3.5\nLiabilities 80.8 50.5\nTotal equity and liabilities 615.6 481.8\n101\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from EUR 56.4 million in 2020 to EUR 63.8 million\nin fiscal year 2021 due to increased capital expenditures, mainly for laboratory plant and\nequipment.\nFinancial assets decreased to EUR 46.4 million due to an impairment loss on the investment\nin APEVA Holdings Ltd. amounting to EUR 4.0 million.\nThe increase in inventories from EUR 69.0 million as of December 31, 2020 to EUR 104.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 mainly reflects the high expected sale of systems in the\nfollowing quarters and the high order backlog.\nTrade receivables increased from EUR 21.5 million to EUR 66.1 million due to a high number\nof deliveries at the end of the 2021 financial year.\nLiabilities\nThe subscribed capital of AIXTRON SE was at EUR 113.3 million as of December 31, 2021\n(December 31, 2020: EUR 112.9 million). Issued capital was EUR 112.2 million (2020:\nEUR 111.8 million). A total of 364,700 shares were issued in the context of stock option pro-\ngrams in the fiscal year.\nAs a result of the exercise of the stock options, the capital reserve increased from EUR 276.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, to EUR 280.8 million as of December 31, 2021.\nDue to the higher balance sheet total, the equity ratio decreased to 79% in the fiscal year\ncompared to 84% in the previous year, despite the increased total equity.\nTo secure prepayments received on orders, AIXTRON SE had aval lines with banks of EUR 57.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR 57.5 million), of which EUR 23.9 million had\nbeen utilized as of the balance sheet date (2020: EUR 25.9 million).\nTrade payables increased to EUR 12.9 million due to reporting date factors and a higher pro-\ncurement volume (2020: EUR 5.8 million).\nAs of December 31, 2021, AIXTRON did not have any bank borrowings, as was the case on\nthe prior-year balance sheet dates.\n102\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInvestments\nIn the context of the Company’s growth, capital expenditures at AIXTRON SE totaled\nEUR 12.2 million in fiscal year 2021 (2020: EUR 5.7 million).\nThereof EUR 10.9 million in 2021 were for property, plant and equipment (2020: EUR 4.2 mil-\nlion).

AIXTRON SE generally participates in the risks of its subsi-\ndiaries in proportion to its respective ownership interest. As a result of the centralized finan-\ncial management of the AIXTRON Group, all financing transactions are conducted through\nAIXTRON SE. As the parent company of the AIXTRON Group, AIXTRON SE is integrated into\nthe Group-wide risk management system. For further information, please refer to the Oppor-\ntunities and Risks Report.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for the AIXTRON Group largely reflects the expectations of AIXTRON SE. The ear-\nnings development of AIXTRON SE should continue to be in line with that of the Group in the\nfuture, as the results of the subsidiaries are reflected in the income from investments of the\nGroup’s parent company. Management by means of performance indicators is carried out\nexclusively at Group level. The comments on the expected results of operations and financial\nposition therefore also apply to AIXTRON SE. For further information please refer to section\n“Expected Developments” of this report.\n104\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Expected Developments, Opportunities and\nRisks\nExpected Developments\nFuture Market Environment\nIn its \"World Economic Outlook\" (January 2022), the IMF forecasts global economic growth\nof 4.4% for 2022. Supported by further vaccination progress, all advanced economies are\nexpected to return to their pre-crisis levels in the coming year, with existing supply bottle-\nnecks and disrupted supply chains continuing to cause uncertainty. Inflation should return\nto normal levels once the base effects from the crisis year 2020 have expired. At this point in\ntime, AIXTRON does not expect the general global economic environment to have a signifi-\ncant impact on its business development. The industry and sector-specific conditions for the\ndemand for AIXTRON equipment remain intact, although the risk of renewed setbacks for\nthe global economy, e. g. due to possible new virus variants, cannot be excluded.\nMarket experts are very positive about the development of production equipment for the\nsemiconductor industry in the coming years. According to a January 2022 study by SEMI2, the\nleading global industry association, the total market for wafer fab equipment, which includes\nAIXTRON's deposition equipment, is expected to grow from approximately USD 89 billion in\nthe year 2021 to approximately USD 98 billion in the year 2022, an all-time high. Korea, Tai-\nwan and China continue to account for a large share of the market, together accounting for\napproximately 73% of the global market. According to SEMI, the market for wafer fab equip-\nment continues to grow in this regard, despite a very strong increase in the previous year.\nInvestments in new capacities for the production of microcontrollers and power devices are\nthe strongest drivers of this growth.\nIrrespective of the market development of the semiconductor industry as a whole, the seg-\nments on which AIXTRON focuses are determined by megatrends, the development of which\nwill be decisive for the future development and size of AIXTRON’s markets:\nSales of power semiconductors made of GaN and SiC materials are mainly driven by the need\nto increase energy efficiency in global IT infrastructure and data centers in order to curb the\nrapid increase in energy consumption. It is expected that the use of electric vehicles in the\nfuture will lead to an increased use of SiC components both, in the powertrain and in the\ncharging infrastructure in order to better meet the requirements for range and efficiency.\n2) source: World Fab Forecast Report, 4Q21 Update, Published by SEMI\nhttps://www.semi.org/en/news-media-press-releases/global-fab-equipment-spending-projected-to-log-record-high-in-\n2022-to-mark-third-consecutive-year-of-growth-semi-reports\n105\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe increasing demand for lasers manufactured on AIXTRON systems is due to the exponen-\ntially growing need for fast and energy-efficient optical data communications (cloud com-\nputing, video streaming, etc.) as well as the adoption of 3D sensing in consumer electronics\n(smart phones, televisions) and in access control areas. Also, the progress of industrial digi-\ntalization and a growing number of semi-autonomous vehicles that use 3D sensing techno-\nlogy will lead to increased demand for lasers.\nFinally, AIXTRON’s future markets will be driven by the adoption of novel displays in smart-\nwatches, TVs, smartphones and notebooks: Micro LED displays, whose self-illuminating LED\npixels can be produced on AIXTRON MOCVD equipment, aim to replace today's LCD or OLED\ndisplay technology with innovative, energy-saving alternatives offering better luminosity,\ncontrast, color fidelity and resolution. The adoption of these novel display technologies will\nsignificantly determine the size of AIXTRON's sales markets.\nExpected Results of Operations and Financial Position\nFor the fiscal year 2022, the Group again expects a growing revenue development compared\nto 2021. Customer demand continues to span all technology areas. The Executive Board\nis optimistic about both the short- and long-term positive outlook, both for demand for\nMOCVD equipment for the production of lasers, in particular for optical data transmission,\nand for LED-based display applications. In terms of demand for equipment for the production\nof power devices based on the wide band gap materials SiC- and GaN (silicon carbide, gallium\nnitride), the Executive Board again anticipates an increasing revenue contribution in fiscal\nyear 2022 compared to 2021.\nBased on the current Group structure, an assessment of the order situation and the budget\nexchange rate of 1.20 USD/EUR (2021: 1.25 USD/EUR), the Executive Board expects order\nintake in a range between EUR 520 million and EUR 580 million for the Group in fiscal year\n2022. With revenues in a range between EUR 450 million and EUR 500 million, the Executive\nBoard expects to achieve a gross margin of approximately 41% and an EBIT margin of ap-\nproximately 21% - 23% of revenues in fiscal year 2022. The expectations for 2022 are subject\nto the condition that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have no significant impact on the\ndevelopment of our business.\nIn addition, with a view to the sustainability targets, the Executive Board is aiming for a slight\nincrease in the share of environmentally sustainable revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx)\nand operating expenses (OpEx) in the medium term as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regula-\ntion.\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board expects that AIXTRON will not require external\nbank financing in fiscal year 2022. Furthermore, it is expected that the Group will be able to\nmaintain a solid equity base for the foreseeable future.\n106\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOverall Statement on the Future Development\nAIXTRON's equipment enables the production of power semiconductors for highly efficient\nenergy conversion in the field of power supply for data centers or consumer electronics, or\nfor electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure (GaN and SiC devices). Lasers manu-\nfactured using AIXTRON equipment are key components in high-speed optical data trans-\nmission (cloud computing, Internet of Things), in 3D sensor technology, and increasingly in\ncomplex vehicle assistance systems. AIXTRON technology also enables the production of high\nfrequency chips for 5G mobile networks and key components for the production of latest\ngeneration displays (fine pitch displays, Mini and Micro LED displays).\nBased on AIXTRON's proven ability to develop and market innovative deposition equipment\nin flexible numbers for multiple customer markets, the Executive Board is convinced of the\npositive future prospects for the Group and its target markets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, AIXTRON did not have any legally binding agreements regarding\nfinancial investments, acquisitions or disposals companies or businesses.\nRisk Report\nRisk Management System\nAIXTRON’s risk management system is centrally controlled and involves all major organizatio-\nnal units of the AIXTRON Group in the process. The Board Member of AIXTRON SE in charge\nof Corporate Governance & Compliance is responsible for establishing an effective risk ma-\nnagement system and informs the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE at\nregular intervals or, if necessary, ad-hoc. In this context, opportunities are considered and\ndocumented in a process that runs separately from AIXTRON’s risk management system.\nThe primary purposes of the risk management system are to support the achievement of\nstrategic business objectives and to identify at an early stage potential risks to current cor-\nporate planning that could have a negative impact on the achievement of strategic business\nobjectives and on business activities. The risk management system supports the Executive\nBoard in the systematic, effective and efficient management of identified risks by defining,\nprioritizing and tracking risk-reducing measures.\nIn order to meet the extended requirements of IDW PS 340 revised, the conformity and in-\nformative value of AIXTRON's risk management system were examined and key instruments\nwere further optimized in terms of their presentation and informative value. The main sub-\n107\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\njects of this review were the further development of the risk management system frame-\nwork, the risk assessment scheme, the risk-bearing capacity, and the resulting overall risk\nposition in the AIXTRON Group. The results and resulting adjustments were integrated into\nthe risk management process and risk reporting, applied in the quarterly risk inventory, and\ndocumented in the Group-wide risk management system manual. All members of the senior\nmanagement team as well as the general managers and other key employees were informed\nabout the adjustments and trained in their application.\nAs a result of the enhancement of the risk management system in fiscal year 2021, the ap-\nproach to assessment and presentation has not changed significantly, so that the risk situa-\ntion is fundamentally comparable with the previous year.\nThe periodic quarterly risk inventory is initiated, carried out and monitored by the central\nrisk manager. During this process, all risk managers from the operational and administrative\nareas, all general managers of the AIXTRON subsidiaries, and the Executive Board are asked\nabout current developments in already known risks and measures to reduce them, as well\nas about potential new risks. The results are collated at central level and discussed in a Risk\nCommittee before the Supervisory Board is informed.\nAIXTRON uses risk management software to support the risk management process. All risk\nmanagers have access to the software. This ensures that abrupt changes in the risk situation\nor newly identified risks are reported by the risk officers and integrated into the risk portfolio\nand reporting.\nAt AIXTRON, all individual risks and risk aggregates are assessed and classified according to a\ndefined scheme. The probability of occurrence is assessed in four stages, as is the potential\namount of damage if the risk occurs. The amount of damage relates to the impact on the\noperating result (EBIT) of the AIXTRON Group; in the case of materiality for relevant risks, a\npossible outflow of cash is also taken as the amount of damage.\nThe probability of risks occurring is broken down into:\n• Remote = < 5%\n• Unlikely = 5% - 10%\n• Possible = >10% - 50%\n• Likely = >50% - 100%\n108\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nWherever possible, risks with a probability of occurrence of more than 50% are recognized\nas provisions in the financial statements or taken into account in planning.\nThe criterion used to assess the potential financial impact of a risk on the AIXTRON Group’s\nearnings (EBIT) is the potential net loss (measured as a percentage of equity):\n• Acceptable = <0.4%\n• Relevant = 0.4% - 2%\n• Serious = >2% - 4%\n• Critical = > 4%\nThe impact of risk is presented both in terms of potential gross/net impact and in terms of\ndifferent periods under consideration (up to 12 months, 13-24 months and greater than 24\nmonths). The gross loss represents the potential loss in the event of a risk occurrence wit-\nhout taking into account further effects such as risk reduction measures.\nThe net loss describes the potential loss in the event of a risk occurring, taking into account\nthe effects resulting from the risk reduction measures, such as insurance, provisions, budget\nand forecast recognition of risks. A risk matrix is derived from this assessment, which divides\nthe risks of the AIXTRON Group into the following four risk classes (see chart for color scale).\n• Acceptable Risk (green)\n• Relevant Risk (yellow)\n• Serious Risk (orange)\n• Substantial Risk (red)\nThe risks classified as substantial are those that are significant in terms of a threat to the con-\ntinued existence of the AIXTRON Group as a going concern as defined by German Accounting\nStandard (GAS 20).\n109\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRisk Map\n110\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\negamad\nfo\ntnuomA\nCritical\nSerious\nRelevant\nAcceptable\nRemote Unlikely Possible Likely\nProbability of occurrence\nSingle Risk Factors\nThe following risks could potentially have a substantially adverse impact on the revenue,\nthe financial position, the net assets, the Company’s liquidity and the market price of the\nAIXTRON share, and on the actual outcome of matters which the forward-looking statements\ncontained in this combined management report refer to. The risks described below are not\nthe only ones the AIXTRON Group faces. There may be additional risks that AIXTRON is cur-\nrently unaware of, as well as general corporate risks such as political risks, the risk of force\nmajeure and other unforeseeable events. There may also be risks that AIXTRON currently\nconsiders to be immaterial, but which may ultimately also have a significantly adverse effect\non the AIXTRON Group. Further information on forward-looking statements can be found in\nthe section “Forward Looking Statements”.\nIn accordance with German Accounting Standard (GAS) 20, the following risks were assessed\nas material as of December 31, 2021:\nMarket- and competition-related risks\nAIXTRON’s target markets are globally distributed, with a regional focus on Asia. Therefore,\nAIXTRON is exposed to global economic cycles and geopolitical risks, e. g. the trade conflict\nbetween the USA and Chian, which could have a negative impact on the AIXTRON Group’s\nbusiness. Such risks cannot be influenced by the AIXTRON Group.\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe markets addressed by AIXTRON are cyclical and can therefore be volatile. The timing,\nlength and intensity of these industry cycles are difficult to predict and to influence by\nAIXTRON. In order to diversify market-related risks, AIXTRON therefore diversifies and offers\nproducts in different target markets.\nAIXTRON competes with other companies in each of these markets. There is always the pos-\nsibility that new competitors may enter the market, or that established competitors may\nadopt strategies or bring products to market that may negatively affect market expectations\nas a whole or for individual key customers of AIXTRON.\nAIXTRON continuously monitors and assesses market developments. In order to reduce the\nrisk of dependence on individual markets and their fluctuations, AIXTRON has implemented\na management system to ensure that market developments are recognized at an early stage\nand exploited optimally.\nAIXTRON’s market and competitive risks are classified as substantial risks, as the level of\ndamage in the event of a possible risk occurrence would have a significant impact on the\nGroup's medium to long-term high revenue and earnings expectations.\nTechnological risks\nThe technologies offered by AIXTRON sometimes enable new, disruptive application oppor-\ntunities. This often means long development and qualification cycles for AIXTRON's products,\nas demanding technical and/or other customer requirements have to be met (sometimes for\nthe first time) before a deal can be closed.\nDue to the often long development and qualification cycles of AIXTRON's products, AIXTRON\nmay develop technologies and products for markets or application areas in which the ge-\nneral conditions of the sales markets or the strategic plans of potential customers change\nfundamentally during the development cycle.\nThe continued focus on research and development activities in the past fiscal year and the\nintensive involvement of external technology partners are still considered by AIXTRON SE´s\nExecutive Board to be suitable measures to reduce this risk.\nAIXTRON’s technology risks are classified as substantial risks, as the level of damage in the\nevent of a potential risk materializing could have a significant impact on the Group's me-\ndium- to long-term high revenue and earnings expectations.\nIf it turns out that a technology risk has materialized and the introduction of a new technolo-\ngy cannot be realized as planned, this can consequently lead to planned and forecast revenu-\nes being exposed to the risk of postponement or discontinuation, and thus to development\nactivities being refinanced later than planned or not at all.\n111\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON’s risk management system considers the following risks to be not material to the\nGroup:\n• Currency risk and other financial risks\n• Sourcing, supply chain and production risks\n• Staff-related risks\n• Legal risks\n• Risks relating to patents and intellectual property\n• IT & Information Security Risks\n• COVID-19 pandemic\nAIXTRON defines IT and information security risks as breaches of integrity, confidentiality,\nand liability.\nThe Group has invested in extensive technical and organizational measures to enhance infor-\nmation security and protect information from unauthorized access, unintentional modifica-\ntion, or deletion. The information security measures taken are subject to regular monitoring\nand continuous improvement and are supported by targeted awareness and training con-\ncepts. Accordingly, the risk classification was reduced overall.\nThe evolution and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are continuously monitored. For this\npurpose, among other things, an interdisciplinary team has been formed and protective and\npreventive measures have been introduced. In addition, the Executive Board regularly com-\nmunicates the current situation - i. e. the latest developments in general and at AIXTRON, as\nwell as the measures derived from them - to the employees.\nAs part of the risk management system, the impact, measures, and outlook related to the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic situation, as well as possible resulting effects on global material\navailability and supply chains, are recorded, discussed, assessed, and reported in our regular\nquarterly risk inventory.\nOverall picture of the risk situation of AIXTRON SE\nCompared to fiscal year 2020, the overall risk situation remains unchanged for fiscal year\n2021, with the exception of the changes in the AIXTRON Group outlined above. The conti-\nnued focus of research and development activities, with an emphasis on the renewal and\nexpansion of the product portfolio, streamlines the risk portfolio and thus improves the ex-\nploitation of opportunities and the avoidance of risks in AIXTRON’s target markets.\n112\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nNeither in fiscal year 2021 nor at the time of writing this Management Report has the Execu-\ntive Board of AIXTRON SE identified risks to the Company that could threaten its continued\nexistence as of December 31, 2021.\nOpportunities Report\nAIXTRON’s core competence is the development of cutting-edge technology for the precise\ndeposition of complex semiconductor structures and other functional materials. The compa-\nny has achieved globally leading positions in these areas. In order to defend or expand these\npositions, AIXTRON invests in appropriate research and development projects, such as for\nMOCVD systems to produce semiconductors for use in LEDs, lasers or power electronics. The\nrenewal and expansion of the entire equipment portfolio is planned for the coming years.\nThe Executive Board will maintain the focus on this core competence in order to successfully\ndevelop both existing as well as new markets.\nImportant market segments for power electronics based on wide-band-gap materials such as\ngallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are the automotive, energy, telecommunicati-\nons and consumer electronics industries. The development of energy-efficient solutions for\nAC/DC converters, inverters and high-frequency power amplifiers are increasingly gaining in\nimportance. The trend towards electrification of vehicles and there charging infrastructure\nusing SiC-based components plays an important role in this regard. GaN-based components,\ne. g. for fast charging of mobile devices, are becoming increasingly popular. The demand for\nenergy-efficient GaN-based power supply in IT, such as data centers or servers, is currently\ngrowing rapidly and is also expected to increase further over the coming years as additional\nmarket segments are developed. GaAs or GaN-based radio frequency devices are used for\nsignal transmission in 5G networks or for the WLAN 6 standard, among others. AIXTRON\nexpects demand for production equipment to increase as the market penetration of these\napplications gains momentum.\nImportant market segments in optoelectronics include consumer electronics, data commu-\nnications and display technology. The trend towards optical data transmission also across\nshorter distances, e. g. in data centers or FTTH, as well as the global expansion of fiber optic\nnetworks for high-speed data transmission, is creating increasing demand for equipment\nto manufacture edge and surface emitting lasers (VCSEL). AIXTRON expects demand in this\narea to increase over the coming years, particularly as demand for 3D sensor technology also\nincreases due to virtual reality or LiDAR applications in the automotive sector. In addition,\nAIXTRON continues to see high demand for equipment for the production of red, orange\nand yellow (ROY), infrared and UV LEDs, for example, due to the growing adoption of direct\nemitting LED displays and applications such as indoor farming. In addition, the upcoming\ncommercialization of Micro LED displays has the potential to generate significant demand for\nequipment for this demanding application. These display technologies have high potential in\nvarious consumer electronics end-use applications.\n113\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end user\nmarkets could possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term:\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based devices for energy-efficient power\nelectronics in automobiles, consumer electronics, mobile devices and IT infrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaN-based devices in the field of 5G network infrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based devices in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for 5G\nmobile communications or WLAN 6 technology\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for high-volume optical data transmission, e.g.,\nfor video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing use of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensing in mobile\ndevices and infrastructure applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) in display\nand other applications\n• Commercialization of Micro LED displays\n114\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMid- to Long-Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated energy management\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual light communication\ntechnology\n• Increasing application of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for\nautonomous driving\n• Use of GaN-based devices in mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) for the millimeter-\nwave range of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Increased development activities for high-performance solar cells made of compound\nsemiconductors\nOverall Picture of Opportunities\nAs part of the assessment of our business opportunities, options for investments or develop-\nment projects are reviewed and prioritized for their potential value contribution to ensure an\neffective allocation of resources. We focus specifically on growth markets that are positively\ninfluenced by global trends such as increasing electromobility, digitalization, and networking,\namong others, in order to systematically and optimally exploit the opportunities that arise for\nthe sustainable and profitable business development of the Group.\nShould identified opportunities be considered probable, then these are included in the busi-\nness plans and short-term forecasts. Any further trends or events that could lead to a positive\ndevelopment for our net assets, financial position and results of operations are being obser-\nved and may have a positive impact on our medium to long-term prospects.\n115\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInternal Control System ICS\nThe AIXTRON Group’s internal control system covers both the accounting process of\nAIXTRON SE and the Group accounting process. It defines controls and monitoring activities\nthat are measures designed to ensure the proper conduct of business activities, reliable fi-\nnancial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations. An appropriate control system,\ntaking into account the size of the Company and its business activities, is the prerequisite to\neffectively manage operational, financial and other risks.\nControls are defined at risk points in the accounting process to help ensure that the consoli-\ndated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules. A separation of functi-\nons appropriate to the size of the company and the application of the dual control principle\nreduce the risk of fraudulent acts.\nA global IT system is used to prepare the annual financial statements and the consolidated\nfinancial statements and for consolidation, ensuring uniform and consistent procedures and\ndata security. Central system backups are regularly performed for the relevant IT systems to\nprevent data loss. In addition, defined authorizations and access restrictions are part of the\nsecurity concept.\nThe Group function Finance is technically and organizationally in charge of the preparation\nof the consolidated financial statements. In the decentralized units, local employees are re-\nsponsible for preparing the local financial statements. Uniform Group accounting is ensured\nby Group-wide guidelines on content and timing, as well as accounting policies and valuation\nprinciples. The Compliance department regularly reviews the observance and effectiveness\nof the controls and is thus integrated into the overall process.\nIt is the opinion of the Executive Board that these coordinated processes, systems and con-\ntrols ensure that the Group accounting process is in accordance with IFRS and that the annu-\nal financial statements comply with the German Commercial Code (HGB) and other accoun-\nting-related regulations and laws and are reliable.\n.\n116\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nLegal Disclosures\nGroup Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f\nin conjunction with Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB)\nThe Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 289f HGB has been combined\nwith the Group Declaration of Corporate Governance pursuant to Section 315d HGB.

General Principles\nAIXTRON SE (“Company”) is incorporated as a European Company (Societas Europaea) under\nthe laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Company is domiciled at Dornkaulstraße\n2, 52134 Herzogenrath, Germany. AIXTRON SE is registered in the commercial register of the\nDistrict Court (“Amtsgericht”) of Aachen under HRB 16590.\nThe consolidated financial statements of AIXTRON SE and its subsidiaries (“AIXTRON“ or\n“Group“) have been prepared in accordance with, and fully comply with\n• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European\nUnion; and\n• the requirements of Section 315e of HGB (German Commercial Law).\nAIXTRON is a leading provider of deposition equipment to the semiconductor industry. The\nGroup's technology solutions are used by a diverse range of customers worldwide to build\nadvanced components for electronic and opto-electronic applications based on compound,\nsilicon, or organic semiconductor materials. Such components are used in fiber optic com-\nmunication systems, wireless and mobile telephony applications, optical and electronic sto-\nrage devices, computing, signaling, and lighting, displays, as well as a range of other leading-\nedge technologies.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Executive Board and\nhave been submitted to the Supervisory Board at its meeting held on February 23, 2022 for\napproval and publication.\n126\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n(A) Companies Included in Consolidation\nCompanies included in consolidation are AIXTRON SE, and companies controlled by AIXTRON\nSE. The balance sheet date of all consolidated companies is December 31. A list of all conso-\nlidated companies is shown in note 32.\n(B) Basis of Accounting\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro (EUR). The amounts are roun-\nded to the nearest thousand Euro (kEUR).\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the re-\nvaluation of certain financial instruments.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported\namounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if this revi-\nsion affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision\naffects both current and future periods. Judgments which have a significant effect on the\nGroup’s financial statements are described in note 37.\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presen-\nted in these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently by each consolidated company.\n127\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(C) Bases of Consolidation\n(I) Subsidiaries\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company\nand entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.\nControl is achieved when the Company:\n• has the power over the investee;\n• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee;\nand\n• has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances\nindicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\nEntities over which AIXTRON SE has control are treated as subsidiaries (see note 32). The re-\nsults of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that\ncontrol commences until the date that control ceases.\n(II) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation\nAll intercompany income and expenses, transactions and balances have been eliminated in\nthe consolidation.\n(D) Foreign Currency\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro (EUR). In the translation\nof financial statements of subsidiaries outside the Euro-Zone the local currencies are also\nthe functional currencies of those companies. Assets and liabilities of those companies are\ntranslated to EUR at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses\nare translated to EUR at average exchange rates for the year or at average exchange rates for\nthe period between their inclusion in the consolidated financial statements and the balance\nsheet date. Net equity is translated at historical rates. The differences arising on translation\nare disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\nExchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates in the case of foreign\ncurrency transactions are recognized in the income statement in „other operating income“\nor „other operating expenses“.\n128\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(E) Property, Plant and Equipment\n(I) Acquisition or Manufacturing Cost\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, plus ancillary charges such as\ninstallation and delivery costs, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment\nlosses (see accounting policy (j)).\nCosts of internally generated assets include not only costs of material and personnel, but also\na share of directly attributable overhead costs, such as employee benefits, delivery costs,\ninstallation, and professional fees.\nWhere parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are\ndepreciated as separate items of property, plant and equipment.\n(II) Subsequent Costs\nAIXTRON recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the\ncost of replacing components or enhancement of such an item when that cost is incurred if\nit is probable that the future economic benefits embodied in the item will flow to the Group\nand the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs such as repairs and main-\ntenance are expensed as incurred.\n(III) Government Grants\nGovernment grants related to the acquisition or manufacture of owned assets are deducted\nfrom original cost at the date of capitalization.\n(IV) Depreciation\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part\nof an item of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives, depreciation method and residual\nvalues of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the year-end date or more fre-\nquently if circumstances arise which are indicative of a change. The estimated useful lives\nare as follows:\n• Buildings 25 - 45 years\n• Machinery and equipment 3 - 19 years\n• Other plant, factory and office equipment 2 - 20 years\nThe useful lives of leased assets do not exceed the expected lease periods.\n129\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(V) Leased Assets\nThe Group as Lessee\nAIXTRON assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of the contract.\nThe Group recognizes a lease asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lea-\nse arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with\na lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as tablets and perso-\nnal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these leases, the Group\nrecognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in\nwhich economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.\nAIXTRON recognizes a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.\nThe leased asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease\nliability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus\nany initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the under-\nlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease\nincentives received.\nThe right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment, and leased assets in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe leased asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the com-\nmencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the expected end\nof the lease term. The estimated useful lives of leased assets are determined on the same\nbases as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the leased asset is periodically\ntested and reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements\nof the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not\npaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if\nthat rate cannot be readily determined, the company’s incremental borrowing rate.\nThe lease liabilities are included in other non-current payables and other current liabilities in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments,\nless any lease incentives and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initi-\nally measured using the index or rate at the commencement date.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in index\nor rate, or if the company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, ex-\ntension or termination option.\n130\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the\ncarrying amount of the leased asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of\nthe leased asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.\n(F) Intangible Assets\n(I) Goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is allocated to\ncash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy (j)).\n(II) Research and Development\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical\nknowledge and understanding using scientific methods, is recognized as an expense as in-\ncurred.\nExpenditure on development comprises costs incurred with the purpose of using scientific\nknowledge technically and commercially. As not all criteria of IAS 38 are met AIXTRON does\nnot capitalize such costs.\n(III) Other Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortization\n(see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (j)).\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are stated at their fair value at the\ndate of purchase.\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and patents is expensed as incur-\nred.\n(IV) Subsequent Expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure on capitalized intangible assets is capitalized only when it increases\nthe future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other\nexpenditure is expensed as incurred.\n(V) Amortization\nAmortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible\nassets, except for goodwill. Goodwill has a useful life which is indefinite and is tested annually\n131\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nin respect of its recoverable amount. Other intangible assets are amortized from the date\nthey are available for use. Useful lives and residual values of intangible assets are reviewed at\nthe year-end date or more frequently if circumstances arise which are indicative of a change.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n• Software 2 - 5 years\n• Patents and similar rights 4 - 18 years\n• Customer base and product and technology know how 6 - 10 years\n(G) Financial Instruments\n(I) Financial Assets\nFinancial assets are classified into the following specific categories: financial assets ‘at fair\nvalue through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI), and ‘at amortized cost’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of\nthe financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.\n(II) F inancial Assets at FVTOCI\nAIXTRON did not have any financial assets in these categories during the periods covered by\nthis report.\n(III) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost as they are held within a business model to\ncollect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(IV) Financial Assets at FVTPL\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI under IFRS 9 are\nmeasured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with\nany fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss including dividends\nearned on financial asset and is included in profit and loss account and in note 5 or 6 respec-\ntively. Fair value is determined in accordance with IFRS 13.\n(V) Trade Receivables\nTrade receivables and other receivables are measured at amortized cost as they are held\nwithin a business model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely\nof payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n132\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(VI) Impairment of Financial Assets\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables\nand contract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date\nto reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.\nThe Group always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables, and contract assets. The ex-\npected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based\non the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the\ndebtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the\nforecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where\nappropriate.\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been\na significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the\nfinancial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group mea-\nsures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\nLifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default\nevents over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents\nthe portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instru-\nment that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.\n(VII) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with banks with a maturity of\nless than three months at inception.\n(VIII) Equity Instruments\nEquity instruments, including share capital, issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\n(IX) Financial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities “at FVTPL” or \"at amortized cost\".\n(X) Financial Liabilities at FVTPL\nAIXTRON did not have any financial liabilities in this category during the periods covered by\nthis report.\n(XI) Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost\nOther financial liabilities, including trade payables, are measured at amortized cost.\n(XII) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange currency\nrates (see note 25). AIXTRON may use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these\n133\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexposures. AIXTRON does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Executive Board,\nwhich provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.\nAIXTRON did not have any derivative financial instruments in the periods covered by this\nreport.\n(H) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of comple-\ntion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using weighted average cost.\nThe cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to\ntheir existing location and condition. In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost\nincludes direct material and production cost, as well as an appropriate share of overheads\nbased on normal operating capacity. Scrap and other wasted costs are expensed on a pe-\nriodic basis either as cost of sales or, in the case of beta tools as research and development\nexpense.\nAllowance for slow moving, excess and obsolete, and otherwise unsaleable inventory is re-\ncorded based primarily on either the estimated forecast of product demand and production\nrequirement or historical usage. When the estimated future demand is less than the inven-\ntory, AIXTRON writes down such inventories.\n(I) Operating Result\nOperating result is stated before finance income, finance expense and tax.\n(J) I mpairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible\nAssets\nGoodwill purchased as part of a business acquisition is tested annually for impairment, irre-\nspective of whether there is any indication of impairment. For impairment test purposes, the\ngoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. Impairment losses are recognized to the ex-\ntent that the carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value\nin use of the cash-generating unit. Details of impairment test are shown in note 12.\nProperty, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets are tested for impairment,\nwhere there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. The Group assesses at the end\nof each period whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment\n134\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlosses on such assets are recognized, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds both\nthe fair value that would be obtainable from a disposal in an arm’s length transaction, and\nthe value in use.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present\nvalue using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks\nassociated with the asset.\nImpairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determi-\nne the recoverable amount. Reversals are made only to the extent that the carrying amount\nof the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no\nimpairment loss had been recognized.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n(K) Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average\nnumber of issued common shares for the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the poten-\ntial dilution that could occur if options issued under the Company’s stock option plans were\nexercised unless such exercises had an anti-dilutive effect.\n(L) Employee Benefits\n(I) Defined Contribution Plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an ex-\npense in the income statement as incurred.\n(II) Share-based Payment Transactions\nStock Option Programs\nThe stock option programs from 2007 and 2012 allow members of the Executive Board, ma-\nnagement, and employees of the Group to acquire shares of AIXTRON SE. The contractual\nterms of these share programs are presented in note 22. These stock option programs are\naccounted for according to IFRS 2 for equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The\nfair value of options granted is recognized as personnel expense with a corresponding increa-\nse in additional paid-in capital. The fair value is calculated at grant date and spread over the\nperiod during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair\nvalue of the options granted is measured using a mathematical model, taking into account\nthe terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The vesting conditions relate\nto a service condition and a market condition in relation to the share price of AIXTRON SE.\nIn the calculation of the personnel expense options forfeited during the performance period\nare taken into account.\n135\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-term Incentive of the Board of Directors (LTI)\nExecutive Board remuneration system at AIXTRON SE consists long-term variable remune-\nration incentives (LTI) granted in shares of AIXTRON SE. These equity-settled share-based\npayments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair\nvalue of the shares granted is measured using a mathematical model, taking into account\nthe terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted. Further details regarding the\nequity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 22 and 31.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period, based on the Group’s esti-\nmate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. For non-market-based vesting\nconditions, the Group reviews its estimate of number of equity instruments at each reporting\ndate during vesting period. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is re-\ncognized in profit or loss and a corresponding adjustment is recognized to equity.\n(M) Provisions\nA provision is recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a\nresult of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required\nto settle this obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the\nexpected future cash flows at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market assessments\nof the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.\n(I) Warranties\nThe Group normally offers one- or two-year warranties on all of its products. Warranty ex-\npenses generally include cost of labor, material and related overhead necessary to repair\na product free of charge during the warranty period. The specific terms and conditions of\nthose warranties may vary depending on the equipment sold, the terms of the contract and\nthe locations from which they are sold. The Group establishes the costs that may be incurred\nunder its warranty obligations and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time\nrevenue is recognized. Factors that affect the warranty liability include the historical and an-\nticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim.\nThe Group accrues warranty cost for systems shipped based upon historical experience. The\nGroup periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty provisions and adjusts the\namounts as necessary.\nExtended warranties, beyond the normal warranty periods, are treated as maintenance ser-\nvices in accordance with (n) below.\n136\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(II) Onerous Contracts\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected economic benefits to\nbe derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting\nits obligations under the contract. The amount recognized as a provision is determined as\nthe excess of the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract over the\neconomic benefits expected to be received. Before making that provision any impairment\nloss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract are recognized. The provision is\ndiscounted to present value if the adjustment is material.\n(III) Restructuring\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan\nfor the restructuring and the parties concerned have been informed. The measurement of\nrestructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring,\nwhich are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not\nassociated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\n(N) Revenue\nAIXTRON enters contracts with customers for goods and services, including combinations of\ngoods and services. Contracts are usually for fixed prices and do not offer any unilateral right\nof return to the customer.\nRevenue is generated from the following major sources:\n• sale of equipment\n• installation of equipment\n• sale and installation of customer specific equipment\n• spare parts\n• services\nRevenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation in contracts with\nits customers by transferring control of goods or services to the customer and it is probable\nthat the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.\nThe sale of equipment involves acceptance tests at AIXTRON´s production facility. After suc-\ncessful completion of this test, the equipment is dismantled and packaged for shipment.\nRevenues from the sale of products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifi-\ncation requirements are recognized at a point in time upon shipment to the customer if full\nacceptance tests have been successfully completed at the AIXTRON production facility and\ncontrol has passed to the customer and the customer can benefit from the product either on\nits own or with other resources that are readily available.\n137\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUpon arrival at the customer site the equipment is reassembled and installed, which is a\nservice generally performed by AIXTRON engineers. Revenue relating to the installation of\nthe equipment is recognized at the point in time when AIXTRON has fulfilled its performance\nobligations under the contract and control of the goods has passed to the customer.\nRevenue related to equipment where meeting the product specification requirements has\nnot yet been demonstrated or the customer cannot benefit from the product either on its\nown or with other resources that are readily available, or where specific rights of return have\nbeen negotiated, is recognized only at the point in time when the customer finally accepts\nthe equipment and has control.\nRevenue for the sale of equipment which is built for a specific customer and does not have\nan alternative use is recognized over time based on milestones for the particular contract\nand the extent to which the Group’s performance obligations have been satisfied. Typically,\nthese contracts relate to a small number of upgrades to equipment already belonging to the\ncustomer.\nRevenue related to spares is recognized at the point in time at which the customer obtains\ncontrol of the goods, generally at the point of delivery.\nRevenue related to services is recognized either at the point in time at which the service,\nsuch as a repair, is delivered and the customer obtains control of the related item, or for ser-\nvices such as extended warranty, revenue is recognized over time during the period in which\nit is provided.\nAIXTRON gives no general rights of return, settlement discounts, credits or other sales in-\ncentives within its terms of sale.\nThe consideration from contracts which include combinations of different performance obli-\ngations such as equipment, spares and services is allocated to each performance obligation\nin an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer.\nThe Group uses a combination of methods such as an estimated cost plus margin approach,\nand allocating discounts from list price proportionately to each performance obligation when\ndetermining the consideration for each performance obligation.\nThe portion of equipment revenue related to installation services is determined based on\neither the fair value of the installation services or, if the Group determines that there may\nbe a risk that the economic benefits of installation services may not flow to the Group, the\nportion of the contract amount that is due and payable upon completion of the installation.\n138\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair value of the installation services corresponds to the part of the transaction price that the\nGroup would be expected to receive as consideration in exchange for this service in the sale\nof such an equipment.\n(O) Expenses\n(I) Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes such direct costs as materials, labor, and related production overheads.\n(II) Research and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of beta tools which do not\nqualify to be recognized as an asset are expensed as research and development costs.\nProject funding received from governments (e.g. state funding) and the European Union is\nrecorded in other operating income, if the research and development costs are incurred and\nprovided that the conditions for the funding have been met.\n(III) Lease Payments\nPayments made under leases for assets which have not been capitalized are recognized as\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(P) G overnment Grants\nGovernment grants awarded for project funding are recorded in other operating income if\nthe research and development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for the\nfunding have been met.\nGovernment grants awarded to support continued employment where work is not allowed\nare recorded as a reduction in the related expense, as this presents the underlying reason\nfor the grant better.\n(Q) Tax\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits can be set off against timing differences and tax losses carried forward or taxable\ntemporary differences exist. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit can be realized. The recoverability of deferred tax assets\nis reviewed at least annually.\n139\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between tax and\ncommercial balance sheets and for losses brought forward for tax purposes as well as for tax\ncredits of the companies included in consolidation. The deferred taxes are calculated, based\non tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date or known to be applicable in the future.\nEffects of changes in tax rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized upon\nsubstantively enacted amendments to the law.\n(R) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in business activities and\nwhose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which\nAIXTRON considers to be its Executive Board, to make decisions about resources to be alloca-\nted to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information\nis available. AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nAccounting standards applied in segment reporting are in accordance with the general ac-\ncounting policies as explained in this section.\n140\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(S) Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement is prepared in accordance with IAS 7. Cash flows from operating\nactivities are prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows from taxes are included in cash\nflows from operating activities.\n(T) Adoption of New and Revised Standards\nNew and Amended IFRS Standards Effective for the Current Year\nIn the current year, the Group has applied the below amendments to IFRS standards and\ninterpretations issued by the Board that are effective for an annual period that begins on or\nafter 1 January 2021. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or\non the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements.\nInitial application of Interest Rate The Group has adopted the Phase 2 amendments\nBenchmark Reform amendments Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. Adopting the-\nto IFRS 9/IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and se amendments enables the Group to reflect the\nIFRS 16 (Phase 2) effects of transitioning from interbank offered ra-\ntes (IBOR) to alternative benchmark interest rates\n(also referred to as ‘risk free rates’ or RFRs) wit-\nhout giving rise to accounting impacts that would\nnot provide useful information to users of financial\nstatements. The change has had no impact on the\nGroup.\nInitial application of COVID-19-Re- In prior year, the IASB issued COVID-19 Related\nlated Rent Concessions beyond Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16) that\nJune 30, 2021 - Amendment to IFRS provides practical relief to lessees in accounting for\n16 rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence\nof COVID-19, by introducing a practical expedient\nto IFRS 16.

Segment Reporting and Revenues\nIFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about\ncomponents of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, as chief ope-\nrating decision maker, in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their\nperformance.\nIn the period 2020 to 2021 the Executive Board regularly reviewed financial information to\nallocate resources and assess performance only on a consolidated Group basis since the\nvarious activities of the Group are largely integrated from an operational perspective. In ac-\ncordance with IFRS, AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nThe Group’s reportable segment is based around the category of goods and services provi-\nded to the semiconductor industry\nRevenues are recognized as disclosed in note 2 (n).\nAIXTRON values the equipment revenue deferred for equipment installation services, using a\nmarket-based approach, based on observed transactions for all such contracts involving two\nelements where revenue has been recognized during the financial year. This is level 2 within\nthe fair value hierarchy described in IFRS 13. The fair value of the installation services is ta-\nken as the most frequently observed (modal value) percentage of the contract price payable\nupon completion of the installation service. For the years 2020 to 2021, 10% of the revenue\nrelated to equipment is allocated for installation services.\nFor contracts where equipment revenue is recognized in two elements, the same method\nis also used to determine the fair value of products delivered, which is taken to be the most\nfrequently observed (modal value) percentage of the contract value payable upon delivery of\nthe equipment to the customer. This is also level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n143\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment revenues and results\nin EUR thousands Note 2021 2020\nEquipment revenues 366,512 223,018\nSpares revenues 57,599 41,348\nServices revenues 4,843 4,881\nRevenue from external customers 428,954 269,247\nInventories recognized as an expense 15 177,983 113,801\nReversals of inventory provisions 15 -585 -1,029\nObsolescence and valuation allowance expense for inventories 15 2,851 1,918\nPersonnel expense 7 79,285 66,081\nDepreciation and impairment 11 8,198 11,525\nAmortization 12 1,631 931\nOther expenses 71,278 53,904\nForeign exchange losses 5 804 1,822\nOther operating income 5 -11,469 -14,536\nSegment profit 98,978 34,830\nFinance income 8 232 348\nFinance expense 8 -279 -104\nProfit before tax 98,931 35,074\nReversals of impairment allowances are included in other operating income as described in\nnote 5.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segment are identical to the Group’s accounting\npolicies as described in note 2.

Generally, the Group demands no securities for financial assets. In accordance\nwith usual business practice for capital equipment however, the Group mitigates its exposure\nto credit risk by requiring payment by irrevocable letters of credit and substantial payments\nin advance from most customers as conditions of contracts for sale of major items of equip-\nment.\nIn 2021 three customers accounted for 28%, 12% and 12% of net trade receivables respec-\ntively. In 2020 three customers accounted for 16%, 11% and 10% of net trade receivables\nrespectively. In determining concentrations of credit risk, the Group defines counterparties\nas having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.\nIncluded in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of kEUR\n2,644 (2020: kEUR 4,111) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has\nnot provided. As there has not been a significant change in credit quality, and although the\nGroup has no collateral, the amounts are considered recoverable.\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to the life-\ntime expected credit loss. Based on its experience, the Group uses a general provision rate\nfor lifetime expected credit loss of 0%, adjusted for factors which are specific to the debtors,\ngeneral economic conditions, and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast\ndirection of conditions at the reporting date. In determining receivables which may be indi-\nvidually impaired the Group has taken into account the likelihood of recoverability based on\nthe past due nature of certain receivables, and our assessment of the ability of all counter-\nparties to perform their obligations.\n161\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

Before the start of a fiscal year, the\nSupervisory Board determines the long-term targets for each Executive Board member for\nthe forthcoming reference period. Each Executive Board member receives forfeitable stock\nawards in the amount of the target LTI as a percentage of the consolidated net income for\nthe year pursuant to the budget adopted for the fiscal year. The number of forfeitable stock\nawards is calculated based on the average of the closing prices on all stock market trading\ndays in the final quarter of the previous year.\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for the\nyear and total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. In this regard, the\nrelative weighting amounts to 50% for consolidated net income for the year, 40% for TSR, and\n10% for sustainability targets.\nAfter the expiry of the three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement is\ndetermined by the Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement, the\nforfeitable stock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise lapse.\nThe maximum number of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection with LTI is\ncapped at 250% of the number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start of the refe-\nrence period. The shares are transferred to the Executive Board member after the four-year\nrestriction period.\nThe fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is recognized as an expen-\nse over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. The fair value\nof the shares granted is measured based on a valuation model taking into account the ves-\nting conditions at which the shares are granted. The TSR ratio is used as a market condition\nin estimating the fair value at the valuation date. For the other non-market-based vesting\nconditions, the Group reviews its estimate of the number of equity instruments during the\nvesting period. Adjustments in the original estimates, if any, are recognized in profit or loss\nand a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.\n168\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the main parameters of the valuation model (Monte Carlo simula-\ntion) for the long-term variable remuneration of the Executive Board (LTI) for the LTI Tranche\n2021 and 2020:\nLTI Tranche 2021 LTI Tranche 2020\nI II I II\nGrant date 09.12.20 21.12.20 26.02.20 08.05.20\nShare price at grant date 12.95 € 13.64 € 9.96 € 9.52 €\nRisk-free interest rate -0.82% -0.79% -0.72% -0.80%\nVolatility AIXTRON 52.47% 52.70% 52.66% 54.77%\nVolatility Peer Group 33.64% 33.73% 33.91% 39.40%\nCorrelation AIXTRON/Index 0.41 0.41 0.37 0.39\nFair Value TSR 18.81 € 20.77 € 15.07 € 14.18 €\nFair Value Plain-Tranche 12.95 € 13.68 € 9.96 € 9.52 €\nIn 2021 and 2022 there were two grant dates each, due to a later entry date of an Executive\nBoard member.

These risks cover all aspects of the business, including financial risks; and the\nrisk management system is in accordance with the corporate governance recommendations\nspecified in the German Corporate Governance Code.\n171\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its existing or future obligations due\nto insufficient availability of cash or cash equivalents. Managing liquidity risk is one of the\ncentral tasks of AIXTRON SE. In order to be able to ensure the Group’s solvency and flexibi-\nlity at all times cash and cash equivalents are projected on the basis of regular financial and\nliquidity planning.\nAs of December 31, 2021 the Group did not have any borrowings (2020: nil). Financial liabili-\nties, all due within one year, of kEUR 26,018 (2020: kEUR 18,225) consisting of trade payables\nand other liabilities and are shown in note 24, together with an analysis of their maturity.\nNon-current payables consist of lease liabilities and other payables. Long term lease liabilities\nof kEUR 3,052 (2020: kEUR 2,245) are shown with an analysis of their maturity in note 27.\nOther non-current payables of kEUR 244 (2020: kEUR 372) are due after more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2021 the Group had kEUR 352,694 (2020: kEUR 309,681) of bank de-\nposits and investments as described in notes 13, 17 and 18.\nCredit Risks\nFinancial assets generally exposed to a credit risk are trade receivables, investments, and\nbank deposits.\nThe Group’s bank deposits and investments are kept with financial institutions that have a\ngood credit standing. Central management of the Group assesses the counter-party risk of\neach financial institution dealt with and sets limits to the Group’s exposure to those institu-\ntions. These credit limits are reviewed from time to time so as to minimize the default risk as\nfar as possible and to ensure that concentrations of risk are managed.\nThe maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk is the total amount of receivables, finan-\ncial assets and bank deposits as described in notes 13, 16, 17 and 18.\nFor contract assets measured at fair value, the maximum amount of the exposure to credit\nrisk is the amount of contract assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 25. There are\nno credit derivatives or similar instruments which mitigate the maximum exposure to credit\nrisk and there has been no change during the period or cumulatively in the fair value of such\nreceivables that is attributable to changes in the credit risk.\n172\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMarket Risks\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates and interest rate risks. Interest rate risks are not material as the Group only receives a\nminor amount of interest income. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments\nto manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Cash deposits are made with the Group’s ban-\nkers at the market rates prevailing at inception of the deposit for the period and currency\nconcerned. The Group’s investments are made into funds bases in the European Union and\nare exposed to changes in the market value of those funds. There has been no change to the\nGroup’s exposure to market risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its expo-\nsure to foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange\nrate risk arising on the export of equipment. The main exchange rates giving rise to the risk\nare those between the US Dollar, GB Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Euro.\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nmonetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:\nAssets Liabilities\nin EUR thousands 2021 2020 2021 2020\nUS Dollars 83,157 60,895 46,041 22,340\nGB Pounds 10,827 14,708 2,198 4,414\nChinese Renminbi 18,726 13,803 3,666 1,302\nExposures are reviewed on a regular basis and are managed by the Group through sensitivity\nanalysis.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity Analysis\nThe Group's global operations expose it primarily to foreign exchange risks by the US Dollar,\nGB Pound and Chinese Renminbi.\nThe following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% change in the value of the Euro\nagainst the US Dollar, GB Pound and Chinese Renminbi. A positive number indicates an in-\ncrease in profit and other equity, a negative number indicates a reduction in profit and other\nequity.\n173\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUSD Currency Effect GBP Currency Effect RMB Currency Effect\nIncrease in value of Euro by 10%\nin EUR thousands 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nProfit or loss -2,400 -2,634 -188 12 -845 -676\nOther comprehensive income -707 856 -485 844 -496 431\nUSD Currency Effect GBP Currency Effect RMB Currency Effect\nDecrease in value of Euro by 10%\nin EUR thousands 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nProfit or loss 2,400 2,634 188 -12 845 676\nOther comprehensive income 707 -856 485 -844 496 -431\nThe sensitivity analysis represents the foreign exchange risk at the year-end date only. It is\ncalculated by revaluing the Group's financial assets and liabilities, existing at 31 December,\ndenominated in US-Dollars, GB Pounds or Chinese Renminbi by 10%. It does not represent\nthe effect of a 10% change in exchange rates sustained over the whole of the financial year,\nonly the effect of a different rate occurring on the last day of the year.\nFair Values and Contract Assets\nCash and cash equivalents, receivables are stated at amortized cost. Other financial assets\nin 2021 comprise financial assets measured at FVTPL.

Advance Payments – Contract Liabilities\nContract liabilities for advance payments from customers occur when a contract requires the\ncustomer to pay a deposit to the Group and the deposit has actually been paid, typically near\nthe commencement of the contract, or if it reflects an unconditional payment claim. Usually,\nadvance payments are up to 50% of the total contract price.\nThe Group records the liability as the advance payment is received and eliminates the liability\nat the same time and up to the same amount as it records revenue until the liability is fully\nextinguished. Changes in contract liabilities for advance payments in the year reflect the\nchanging level of outstanding customer orders.\nRevenues of kEUR 40,278 were realized in 2021 from the kEUR 50,824 of contract liabilities\nfor advance payments outstanding at the end of 2020. Revenues of kEUR 45,341 were rea-\nlized in 2020 from the kEUR 51,051 of contract liabilities for advance payments outstanding\nat the end of 2019. In 2021 no revenue was recognized from performance obligations that\nwere settled in prior years.\n176\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27.

A similar portfolio of short-\nterm leases exists at the reporting date.\nThe Group leases certain buildings, equipment and vehicles under various leases. Under\nmost of the lease commitments for buildings the Group has options to renew the leasing\ncontracts. The leases typically run for a period between one and ten years. None of the lea-\nses include contingent rentals.\n177\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n28. Restructuring Costs\nIn the second quarter of 2021, the Group’s OLED activities were initially restructured and\nfocused on the Chinese market. In the course of this, the workforce of APEVA Co. in Korea\nand of APEVA SE in Germany were reduced. In the first half year, costs of kEUR 3,233 were\nincurred in scope of these activities, mainly for severance payments and other personnel-re-\nlated expenses.\nAs customers in this market are also opting for Micro LED as the technological basis for the\ndevelopment of the next generation of displays even faster than originally expected the\nshareholders of APEVA have decided not to make further investments in APEVA and to wind\nup the APEVA Group. In course of this development, an additional impairment, and other\ncosts according to the restructuring in the amount kEUR 655 were recognized in the fourth\nquarter 2021.\nExpenses incurred in the following areas:\nin EUR thousands 2021 2020\nCost of sales 42 0\nGeneral administration expenses 704 0\nResearch and development cost 3,142 0\nTotal 3,888 0\n178\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n29.

Contingencies\nAIXTRON is involved in various legal proceedings or can be exposed to a threat of legal pro-\nceedings in the normal course of business. The Executive Board regularly analyses these\nmatters, considering any possibilities of avoiding legal proceedings or of covering potential\ndamages under insurance contracts and has recognized, where required, appropriate pro-\nvisions. It is not expected that such matters will have a material effect on the Group’s net\nassets, results of operations and financial position.\n31.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of\nEstimation and Uncertainty\nThe preparation of AIXTRON’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make\ncertain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that the Group believes are reasonable ba-\nsed upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported\namounts and related disclosures and are made in order to fairly present the Group’s financial\nposition and results of operations. The following accounting policies are significantly impac-\nted by these estimates and judgments that AIXTRON believes are the most critical to aid in\nfully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue for the supply of most equipment to customers is generally recognized in two stages,\npartly on delivery and partly on final installation and acceptance (see note 2 (n)). The Group\nbelieves, based on past experience, that this method of recognizing revenue fairly states the\nrevenues of the Group. The judgements made by management include an assessment of the\npoint at which control has passed to the customer.\nValuation of Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This requires the Group to\nmake judgments concerning obsolescence of materials. This evaluation requires estimates,\nincluding both forecasted product demand and pricing environment, both of which may be\nsusceptible to significant change. The carrying amount of inventories is disclosed in note 15.\n184\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs disclosed in notes 3 and 15, during the years 2021 and 2020 the Group incurred expenses\nof kEUR 2,851 and kEUR 1,918 respectively arising mainly from changes to past assumpti-\nons concerning net realizable value of inventories and excess and obsolete inventories. In\nfuture periods, write-downs of inventory may be necessary due to (1) reduced demand in\nthe markets in which the Group operates, (2) technological obsolescence due to rapid de-\nvelopments of new products and technological improvements, or (3) changes in economic\nor other events and conditions that impact the market price for the Group’s products. These\nfactors could result in adjustment to the valuation of inventory in future periods, and signifi-\ncantly impact the Group’s future operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether the realization of future tax benefits\nis sufficiently probable to recognize deferred tax assets. This assessment requires the exercise\nof judgement on the part of management with respect to future taxable income. The parent\ncompany AIXTRON SE does generally not exceed a planning horizon of twelve months. The\nrecorded amount of total deferred tax assets could be reduced or increased if estimates of\nprojected future taxable income are lowered or increased, or if changes in current tax regu-\nlations are enacted that impose restrictions on the timing or extent of the Group’s ability to\nutilize future tax benefits. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is disclosed in note 14.\nProvisions\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. At each balance sheet date, the Group\nassesses the valuation of the liabilities which have been recorded as provisions and adjusts\nthem if necessary. Because of the uncertain nature of the timing or amounts of provisions,\njudgement has to be exercised by the Group with respect to their valuation. Actual liabilities\nmay differ from the estimated amounts. Details of provisions are shown in note 23.\nLegal proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and\nclaims. The Company, based upon advice from legal counsel, believes that the matters the\nGroup is aware of are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition\nor results of operations. The Group is not aware of any unasserted claims that may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation.\n185\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCOVID-19\nEffects of COVID-19 on the business are discussed in the Group Management Report.

In addition, we have audited the\ncombined management report for the parent and the group of AIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath/\nGermany, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2021. In accordance with the\nGerman legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the corporate governance\nstatement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d German Commercial Code (HGB), including\nthe further reporting on corporate governance included therein, nor the content of the con-\nsolidated non-financial report pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c HGB, each of which is\nreferred to in the combined management report.\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects,\nwith the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German\ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these\nrequirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of\nthe Group as at December 31, 2021 and of its financial performance for the financial\nyear from January 1 to December 31, 2021, and\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate\nview of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this combined management\nreport is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German\nlegal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future\ndevelopment.

Our responsibilities under those requirements and prin-\nciples are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolida-\nted Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s\nreport. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of\nEuropean law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other\nGerman professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in\naccordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have\nnot provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We\nbelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a\nbasis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined\nmanagement report.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi-\ncance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from Janua-\nry 1 to December 31, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we\ndo not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\nIn the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our\naudit:\n1.R evenue Recognition for Multiple-element Arrangements Including Cut-off\n2.M easurement of Deferred Tax Assets\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\na) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated\nfinancial statements)\nb) a uditor’s response\n189\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n1. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-element Arrangements Including Cut-off\na) The revenue as stated in the consolidated income statement amounts to kEUR 428,954. A\nsubstantial proportion of this revenue comprises the settlement of customer contracts that\ninclude multiple performance obligations. These arrangements primarily deal with the cus-\ntomer-specific manufacturing and supply of semiconductor equipment and its installation\nat the customer’s site. Furthermore, in specific cases, the Group and the customer agree\non the supply of related spare parts and/or the provision of services such as maintenance\nservices and/or certain rights of return. These services are to be measured separately. As\npart of the technical acceptance process with regard to the equipment, additional services\nmay be required. These additional services also have to be considered when recognizing\nrevenue. Generally, the contract with the customer provides for a transaction price for the\nequipment and the remaining elements such as installation, spare parts packages, services\nand specific rights of return. Consequently, the transaction price needs to be allocated to\neach performance obligation based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Except for\ncertain rights of return that exceed the common periods, the performance obligations are\nsatisfied at a certain point in time and the related revenue is realized. The determination of\nthe time of revenue recognition regarding arrangements comprising multiple performance\nobligations and the cut-off as part of revenue recognition are subject to the executive di-\nrectors’ judgment and assumptions due to the highly individual customer contracts and\ncomplex equipment. As a consequence, we considered this issue to be a key audit matter.\nThe information of the executive directors on revenue is provided in section 2 “Significant\nAccounting Polices” in note N “Revenue” as well as in section 3 “Segment Reporting and\nRevenues” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nb) F irst, we recorded and assessed the major processes from order confirmation until settle-\nment including the audit of the design, implementation and effectiveness of the accoun-\nting-related controls regarding revenue recognition. In this context, our audit primarily\ncovered the effectiveness of the controls regarding the allocation of the transaction price\nto the individual performance obligations, the complete provision of the supply and ins-\ntallation services and the recognition of the supplied equipment and installation services\non an accrual basis.\nWe performed the following audit procedures based on a stratified and random selection\nof a sample taken from equipment supplies and installation services by means of a repre-\nsentative sampling method:\n• equipment supplies: audit of an existent customer contract, evaluation of the\nallocation of the transaction price on a relative stand-alone selling price basis to\nthe individual supply and service elements by verifying the underlying contract,\nreviewing the time of revenue recognition pursuant to contract terms, primarily\nthe incoterms based on the acceptance test records and based on the acceptance\n190\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nand supply records of the dispatch company.\n• installation services: audit of an existent final acceptance record signed by the\ncustomer including the review of estimations made by the executive directors\nregarding work to be done yet as well as any additional agreements to the contract\nwith the customer as regards additional services to be rendered and review of the\nrelated cut-off of revenue.\n• assessment of the completeness and appropriateness of the corresponding\ninformation provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n2. Measurement of Deferred Tax Assets\na) Total deferred tax assets of kEUR 24,735 (accounting for 3.3% of the Group’s total assets)\nare stated as “Deferred tax assets” in the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThese deferred tax assets were determined based on the Group’s tax planning and main-\nly result from tax loss carry-forwards (kEUR 23,649) and deductible differences between\nIFRS carrying values and their tax base to be reversed in the following years (kEUR 1,086).\nThe majority of the deferred tax assets (kEUR 20,714) results from the parent company\nAIXTRON SE, which has comprehensive tax loss carry-forwards. The executive directors are\nof the opinion that for the parent company a reasonable derivation of an estimation of\ntaxable results beyond a period of twelve months after the reporting date is not possible\nfor a technology company characterized by highly fluctuating demand and volatile results.\nAccordingly, deferred taxes on tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences concer-\nning the parent company AIXTRON SE were only recognized insofar as they are expected to\nbe used in 2022. The deferred tax assets concerning the parent company AIXTRON SE are\nmeasured using a tax rate of 32.8%, which is the currently applicable income tax rate. The\nother deferred tax assets result from tax loss carry-forwards and deductible differences\nconcerning the foreign subsidiaries of AIXTRON SE. As they are largely secured by cost-\nplus agreements with the parent company, which bears the major risks, these deferred tax\nassets are based on tax planning strategies over a period of three years using the corre-\nsponding local tax rates.\nThe result of the computation of the deferred tax assets depends on whether tax benefits\ncan be realized from tax loss carry-forwards according to estimations and assumptions of the\nexecutive directors and, therefore, are subject to uncertainties. Accordingly, we considered\nthe measurement of deferred taxes to be a key audit matter.\nInformation on deferred taxes is provided by the executive directors of the parent company\nin note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nb) A s part of our audit, we used the knowledge and audit results gained in previous ye-\nars. For the purpose of risk assessment, we obtained an understanding of the\npast adherence to the budget. First, we assessed whether the measurement met-\nhods applied are appropriate. General and industry-specific market expectations\nof the executive directors of AIXTRON SE were compared with external sources.\n191\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nAs part of our examination of the tax matters, we consulted internal tax experts, who were\ninvolved in the audit team. They supported us in assessing the installed processes and\ncontrols for validating the budget estimations and recognizing tax matters. In addition,\nwith respect to the tax planning, we queried the recognition of the deferred taxes and the\nexplanations of the executive directors. We assessed the recoverability of the deferred tax\nassets on tax loss carry-forwards on the basis of corporate forecasts and the budget pre-\npared by the executive directors concerning the future taxable profits of AIXTRON SE and\nits major subsidiaries and reviewed the appropriateness of the basis used for the budget.\nFurthermore, we obtained an understanding of the reconciliation between the expected\ntax expense, which was determined by applying the weighted group tax rate, and the re-\ncognized tax expense.\nOther Information\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other informa-\ntion. The other information comprises\n• the report of the supervisory board,\n• the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB,\nincluding the further reporting on corporate governance included therein, referred to\nin section “Legal Disclosures” of the combined management report,\n• the consolidated non-financial report pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c HGB\nreferred to in section “Legal Disclosures” of the combined management report,\n• the executive directors’ confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements\nand the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and\nSection 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and\n• all other parts of the annual report,but not the consolidated financial statements, not\nthe audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor’s report\nthereon.\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive\ndirectors and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Secti-\non 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) concerning the German Corporate Governance\nCode including the further reporting on corporate governance, which is part of the corporate\ngovernance statement, and which is referred to in the combined management report. Other-\nwise the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined manage-\nment report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an\naudit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n192\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified\nabove and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited\ncontent of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit,\nor\n• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the\nadditional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and\nthat the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a\ntrue and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the\nGroup. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they\nhave determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nthat are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible\nfor assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the respon-\nsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are\nresponsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless\nthere is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined\nmanagement report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position\nand is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, com-\nplies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks\nof future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrange-\nments and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation\nof a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal\nrequirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in\nthe combined management report.\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process\nfor the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined manage-\nment report.\n193\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of\nthe Combined Management Report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,\nand whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of\nthe Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated finan-\ncial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal\nrequirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development,\nas well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the combined management report.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit con-\nducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance\nwith German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by\nthe Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Missta-\ntements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined manage-\nment report.\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the au-\ndit. We also:\n• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher\nthan for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of\nthe combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit\nopinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors\nand the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related\ndisclosures.\n• conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern\nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on\nthe Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\n194\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined\nmanagement report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective\naudit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the\ndate of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the\nGroup to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial\nstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial\nstatements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the\nconsolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,\nfinancial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as\nadopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law\npursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of\nthe entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We\nremain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n• evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated\nfinancial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s\nposition it provides.\n• perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive\ndirectors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate\naudit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the\nexecutive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper\nderivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express\na separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions\nused as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ\nmaterially from the prospective information.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant\ndeficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with\nthe relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and\nother matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where\napplicable, the related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those\nmatters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\nfor the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters\nin the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n195\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nOTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nReport on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and of the Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication\nPursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB\nAudit Opinion\nWe have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasona-\nble assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements\nand of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as “ESEF documents”)\nprepared for publication, contained in the provided file, which has the SHA-256 value\n8A92B40D93B1C77570DCC62AD1B3F2E68CBB059EDCCB71E9DE08C9F30C0C7195, meet,\nin all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to\nSection 328 (1) HGB (“ESEF format”).

This is mainly based on the continuing high demand from various end markets, in par-\nticular from the areas of gallium nitride and silicon carbide based power electronics, wireless\nand optical data transmission as well as LED applications for fine pitch displays and indoor\nfarming. Accordingly, at EUR 377.6 million order intake for the first nine months of 2021\nwas significantly higher than the previous year's figure (9M/2020: EUR 209.3 million). As ex-\npected, revenues and earnings also improved significantly in the third quarter of 2021. As a\nresult, at EUR 248.1 million and EUR 41.1 million respectively revenues and EBIT for the first\nnine months of 2021 were also 54% and 299% respectively higher than the previous year's\nfigures (9M/2020 revenues: EUR 161.1 million; 9M/2020 EBIT: EUR 10.3 million). The positi-\nve order and revenue development of the past quarter supports the Executive Board's high\nexpectations for order intake and revenues for the full year 2021. Accordingly, the Executive\nBoard confirms its forecast for the full year 2021.\nAt EUR 114.2 million, order intake in the third quarter of 2021 was significantly higher than\nin the previous year’s quarter (Q3/2020: EUR 70.8 million). Due to the significant volume of\ndeliveries in the past quarter, the equipment order backlog decreased slightly to EUR 267.6\nmillion as at September 30, 2021 (June 30, 2021: EUR 295.0 million).\nAs expected, revenues in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 93% to EUR 130.8 million\n(Q2/2021: EUR 67.7 million) compared to the previous quarter. Q3/2021 revenues were lar-\ngely driven by equipment deliveries for gallium nitride based power electronics, wireless\nand optical data transmission as well as LED applications. Compared to the previous year,\nrevenues in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 104% (Q3/2020: EUR 64.1 million). Gross\nprofit in Q3/2021 was EUR 56.3 million with a gross margin of 43% (Q3/2020: EUR 25.8\nmillion; 40%; Q2/2021: EUR 27.9 million; 41%). Operating expenses were EUR 20.1 million\nin Q3/2021, slightly down from the previous quarter (Q2/2021: EUR 22.3 million; Q3/2020:\nEUR 17.6 million). This resulted in an operating profit (EBIT) of EUR 36.2 million and an EBIT\nmargin of 28% (Q2/2021: EUR 5.6 million; 8%; Q3/2020: EUR 8.2 million; 13%).\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nNet profit in Q3/2021 was EUR 31.4 million (Q2/2021: EUR 7.7 million; Q3/2020: EUR 7.1\nmillion). The development of revenue and earnings in the third quarter of 2021 is therefore\nfully in line with the expectations of the Executive Board.\nFree cash flow in Q3/2021 was EUR -19.0 million (Q2/2021: EUR 18.0 million; Q3/2020:\nEUR 5.0 million). Key drivers were the increase in inventories for planned deliveries in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 and investments in next-generation laboratory equipment.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of EUR 330.7 mil-\nlion as of September 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR 309.7 million; September 30, 2020:\nEUR 292.8 million). The equity ratio was 78% as at September 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020:\n84%). The decrease from the previous year is mainly due to high advance payments from\ncustomers, which are reported as liabilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still posing no significant risk to the AIXTRON Group and our\nbusiness. Strict internal protective measures are in place to ensure safety in operations. This\nincludes the offer to all AIXTRON employees to have a regular COVID 19 screening carried\nout regularly at the worksite or to be vaccinated during working hours. Office occupation is\nat the targeted 50% mark. In total, the pandemic continues to have only a minor impact on\nour business. Logistics and supply chains are tense but remain stable overall.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group AIXTRON\n(“the AIXTRON Group” or “the Company”) can be found in the Annual Report 2020. There\nwere no changes in the first nine months of 2021. The Report is publicly available for down-\nload on the Company’s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nBusiness Performance and Key Developments\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\n9M 2021 9M 2020 +/-\nm EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 377.6 209.3 168.3 80\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 267.6 164.1 103.5 63\nOrder intake in the first nine months of 2021 increased by 80% year-on-year to EUR 377.6\nmillion (9M/2020: EUR 209.3 million). At EUR 114.2 million in Q3 2021, order intake was again\nat the high level of previous quarters (Q2/2021: EUR 139.0 million; Q1/2021: EUR 124.4 mil-\nlion). For comparability reasons, the US dollar-based equipment order intake and equipment\norder backlog received in the 2021 financial year were translated at the internally determi-\nned annual budget rate of 1.25 USD/EUR (2020: USD/EUR 1.20).\nThe total equipment order backlog of EUR 267.6 million as at September 30, 2021 was also\nsignificantly higher than in the previous year (9M/2020: EUR 164.1 million) but, due to the\nlarge volume of deliveries, lower than in the previous quarter (Q2/2021: EUR 295.0 million).\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average USD/EUR exchange rate used by AIXTRON in 9M/2021 was 1.20 USD/\nEUR (Q1/2021: 1.22 USD/EUR; Q2/2021: 1.20 USD/EUR; Q3/2021: 1.18 USD/EUR). This com-\npares to an exchange rate of 1.13 USD/EUR in 9M/2020. Compared to the prior year average,\nthe US dollar depreciated by 6% in 9M/2021, with a corresponding impact on the AIXTRON\nGroup's US dollar-based revenues and earnings over the first nine months. For the US dollar\nbased forecast revenues of Q4/2021, AIXTRON continues to apply the budgeted 2021 USD/\nEUR exchange rate of 1.25 USD/EUR.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of 2021 amounted to EUR 248.1 million and were\nthus EUR 87.0 million or 54% higher than the corresponding previous year’s figure (9M/2020:\nEUR 161.1 million). This is mainly due to the order intake in the relevant previous quarters,\nwhich is now reflected in the revenue development upon delivery of the systems ordered at\nthat time. Compared to the previous quarter, revenues in the third quarter of 2021 increased\nby 93% to EUR 130.8 million (Q2/2021: EUR 67.7 million).\nEquipment revenues in 9M/2021 were EUR 204.3 million, representing 82% of total revenu-\nes in 9M/2021 (9M/2020: EUR 129.5 million; 80%). In Q3/2021, equipment revenues were\nEUR 112.7 million or 86% of revenues (Q3/2020: EUR 53.0 million; 83%; Q2/2021: EUR 53.4\nmillion; 79%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n9M 2021 9M 2020 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 204.3 82 129.5 80 74.8 58\nRevenues from service,\n43.8 18 31.7 20 12.1 38\nspare parts, etc.\nTotal 248.1 100 161.1 100 87.0 54\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRevenues by Region\n9M 2021 9M 2020 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 166.1 67 124.9 78 41.2 33\nEurope 56.5 23 20.7 13 35.8 173\nAmericas 25.4 10 15.6 10 9.8 63\nTotal 248.1 100 161.1 100 87.0 54\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n9M 2021 9M 2020 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR %\nCost of sales 146.6 59 97.9 61 48.7 50\nGross profit 101.4 41 63.3 39 38.1 60\nOperating costs 60.3 24 52.9 33 7.4 14\nSelling expenses 7.2 3 7.3 5 -0.1 -2\nGeneral and administration\n18.2 7 13.7 9 4.5 33\nexpenses\nResearch and development costs 40.5 16 41.2 26 -0.7 -2\nNet other operating (income)\n(5.6) -2 (9.3) (6) (3.7) -40\nand expenses\nGross profit in 9M/2021 was EUR 101.4 million with a gross margin of 41% (9M/2020:\nEUR 63.3 million or 39%; Q3/2021: EUR 56.3 million or 43%; Q2/2021: EUR 27.9 million or\n41%). This reflects both the higher revenues compared to the previous year and a more fa-\nvorable product mix.\nOperating expenses of EUR 60.3 million increased in 9M/2021 compared to the previous\nyear (9M/2020: EUR 52.9 million; Q3/2021: EUR 20.1 million; Q2/2021: EUR 22.3 million),\nwhich includes restructuring costs for APEVA in the amount of approximately EUR 3.2 million\n(see chapter \"Restructuring costs\" in the Explanatory Notes). Furthermore, higher variab-\nle remuneration components were incurred. In the previous year, a special effect due to a\nchange of use for a production facility led to other operating income of EUR 2.9 million.\nR&D expenses in 9M/2021 decreased slightly by EUR 0.7 million year-on-year to EUR 40.5\nmillion (9M/2020: EUR 41.2 million; Q3/2021: EUR 13.7 million; Q2/2021: EUR 14.9 million).\nThis was due to lower running costs for OLED technology, which were offset by increased\nexpenses for next-generation MOCVD equipment.\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nKey R&D Information\n9M 2021 9M 2020 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 40.5 41.2 -2%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 16 26 -10pp\nNet other operating income and expenses resulted in an operating income of EUR 5.6 mil-\nlion in 9M/2021 (9M/2020: EUR 9.3 million; Q3/2020: EUR 1.7 million; Q2/2021: EUR 2.2\nmillion). This reflects in particular R&D grants of EUR 5.2 million. The high positive balance\nin the first nine months of the previous year was significantly influenced by the above-men-\ntioned special effect from the reversal of impairment losses due to the planned change of\nuse of a production facility.\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved from EUR 10.3 million in 9M/2020 to EUR 41.1 million\nin 9M/2021 (Q3/2021: EUR 36.2 million; Q2/2021: EUR 5.6 million). This development main-\nly results from the year-on-year increase in revenues and the corresponding gross margin\nand is due to the business and cost development described above.\nIn the first nine months of 2021, income from income taxes of EUR 1.9 million was reported\n(tax expense 9M/2020: EUR 1.0 million; tax expense Q3/2021: EUR 4.7 million; tax income\nQ2/2021: EUR 2.1 million). This development was significantly influenced by the capitaliza-\ntion of deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards in the first half of 2021 in the amount of\nEUR 7.9 million due to expected future profits. In Q3/2021 a tax expense of EUR 4.7 million\nwas incurred.\nThe AIXTRON Group's net result in 9M/2021 was EUR 42.9 million (9M/2020: EUR 9.6 mil-\nlion; Q2/2021: EUR 7.7 million). In Q3/2021, the result increased significantly to EUR 31.4\nmillion (Q3/2020: EUR 7.1 million). The changes are mainly due to the aforementioned volu-\nme and margin effects.\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinancial Position and Net Assets (Highlights)\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of September 30, 2021, or December\n31, 2020.\nTotal equity increased to EUR 537.6 million as of September 30, 2021, from EUR 496.4 mil-\nlion as of December 31, 2020. This reflects mainly the period’s net result and the dividend\npayment of AIXTRON SE. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2021, was 78% compared to\n84% as of December 31, 2020, due to the significant year-on-year increase in advance pay-\nments received from customers.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets increased to EUR 330.7 million as at Septem-\nber 30, 2021, compared to EUR 309.7 million as at December 31, 2020, mainly due to higher\nadvance payments received from customers during the reporting period. Other financial as-\nsets as at September 30, 2021, include fund investments of EUR 132.0 million (December 31,\n2020: EUR 62.4 million), short-term bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million (December 31, 2020:\nEUR 0 million) and long-term bank deposits of EUR 0 million (December 31, 2020: EUR 60.0\nmillion). The non-current bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million included as at December 31,\n2020, were reclassified to current financial assets as at June 30, 2021.\nProperty, plant and equipment as at September 30, 2021, increased to EUR 70.6 milli-\non compared to December 31, 2020 due to higher investments in laboratory equipment\n(EUR 63.5 million as at December 31, 2020).\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 71.9 million as at September 30, 2021, compared to EUR 71.0\nmillion as at December 31, 2020. There were no impairments in the first nine months of\n2021. The difference is due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components and work in progress, increased by 74% to\nEUR 137.3 million as at September 30, 2021 compared to EUR 79.1 million as at December\n31, 2020, indicating an increase in deliveries planned in subsequent quarters.\nTrade receivables as at September 30, 2021 amounted to EUR 38.0 million (December 31,\n2020: EUR 41.3 million), mainly reflecting the current business volume in the third quarter of\n2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nContract liabilities from advance payments received from customers amounted to EUR 85.9\nmillion as at September 30, 2021, compared to EUR 50.8 million as at December 31, 2020,\nreflecting the current order situation.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCash flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities, adjusted for changes in financial assets -\ninvestments + proceeds from disposals) was EUR 27.1 million in 9M/2021 (9M/2020: EUR- 3.3\nmillion; Q3/2021: EUR -19.0 million; Q2/2021: EUR 18.0 million). This development is mainly\ndue to the positive result taking into account investments made.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first nine months of 2021, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further sig-\nnificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2020 Annual\nReport. The risks associated with COVID-19 continue to be assessed as not significant because\nit turned out that demand for our products was not significantly affected by the pandemic and\nour supply chains, although strained, are still functioning reliably.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2020 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the business development in the first nine months of the 2021 fiscal year, the Exe-\ncutive Board confirms the most recent full-year forecast.\nAccordingly, the Executive Board expects order intake for the 2021 financial year to range\nbetween EUR 440 million and EUR 480 million. In terms of revenues, the Executive Board\nanticipates a range between EUR 400 million and EUR 440 million. AIXTRON also expects to\nachieve a gross margin of approximately 40% of revenues and an EBIT margin of between\n20% and 22% of revenues in 2021. The expectations for 2021 are based on the assumption\nthat the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have no significant impact on the development\nof business operations.\nIn addition, with a view to the AIXTRON Group’s sustainability goals, which were redefined\nin 2020, the Executive Board is aiming for a discernible reduction in energy consumption\nin the medium term, as well as a significant expansion of further training measures for the\nemployees.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the further development of the global eco-\nnomy and the global trade in order to assess any potential effects on AIXTRON’s own supply\nchain and production as well as on customer demand and thus on AIXTRON’s business de-\nvelopment at any time and – if necessary – to initiate appropriate counter measures\nFurther details regarding the annual forecast can also be found in the \"Forecast Re-\nport\" section of the Annual Report 2020, as well as in the \"Outlook\" section of the

Accordingly, order intake for H1/2021 was\nsignificantly higher than the previous year’s figure at EUR 263.3 million (H1/2020: EUR 138.4 million).\nThis is a result of the continued high demand from various end-markets, especially in the fields\nof gallium nitride power electronics, wireless and optical data transmission, as well as LEDs for\nfine pitch displays and indoor farming. Revenue in H1/2021 also improved as expected from the\nprior year and was 21% higher year-on-year at EUR 117.2 million (H1/2020: EUR 97.0 million). The\npositive and better-than-expected order situation in the first six months will lead to an increase\nin deliveries and revenues in the 2021 financial year. Accordingly, the Executive Board raised the\nforecast for the 2021 financial year on June 9, 2021 and communicated it via ad-hoc release. Based\non the very positive order development, the Executive Board is once again raising the forecast\nfor the order intake in the financial year 2021 to a range of EUR 440 million to EUR 480 million\n(previously: EUR 420 million to EUR 460 million). The Executive Board reaffirms the forecast for\nthe financial year 2021, which was raised in June, of revenues between EUR 400 million to\nEUR 440 million, a gross margin of around 40% of revenues and an EBIT margin of 20% to\n22% of revenues.\nAt EUR 139.0 million in Q2/2021, order intake exceeded the high level of the previous quarter\n(Q1/2021: EUR 124.4 million) and reached the highest level since 2011. It was thus about twice as\nhigh as in the same quarter of the previous year (Q2/2020: EUR 69.6 million). This development is\nmainly due to high demand for equipment for the production of gallium nitride power electronics,\ncomponents to build and expand 5G mobile and fibre optical networks, as well as LEDs for fine\npitch displays and indoor farming. This was also reflected in the second quarter in corresponding\nlarge orders placed by our customers for the above-mentioned application. The equipment order\nbacklog as of June 30, 2021, increased to EUR 295.0 million (Q1/2021: EUR 223.5 million).\n4\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe revenue and earnings development in Q2/2021 is fully in line with expectations and in line\nwith our customers’ delivery requests. Compared to the previous year, revenues in Q2 2021\nincreased by 21% to EUR 67.7 million (Q2/2020: EUR 56.0 million) and were 37% higher compared\nto the previous quarter (Q1/2021: EUR 49.5 million). Gross profit for Q2/2021 was EUR 27.9 million\nwith a gross margin of 41% (Q2/2020: EUR 22.9 million; 41%; Q1/2021: EUR 17.3 million; 35%).\nThe gross margin for H1/2021 was 39%. Operating expenses for Q2/2021 were EUR 22.3 million,\nhigher than the previous quarter (Q1/2021: EUR 18.0 million; Q2/2020: EUR 19.6 million), which was\nmainly due to the structural adjustments at our OLED-specialist subsidiary APEVA announced in\nthe supplementary report of the quarterly statement for the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in\nan operating result (EBIT) of EUR 5.6 million and an EBIT margin of 8% (Q1/2021: EUR -0.7 million;\n-1%; Q2/2020: EUR 3.3 million; 6%). The net profit in Q2/2021 was EUR 7.7 million (Q1/2021:\nEUR 3.8 million; Q2/2020: EUR 3.3 million). In this context, the capitalization of deferred taxes on\nloss carryforwards in the amount of EUR 3.4 million in Q2/2021 due to expected future profits had\na positive impact.\nFree cash flow in Q2/2021 was EUR 18.0 million (Q1/2021: EUR 28.1 million; Q2/2020:\nEUR -11.3 million), largely due to the current result and an increase in advance payments by\ncustomers.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of EUR 348.2 million\nas of June 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR 309.7 million; June 30, 2020: EUR 288.6 million). Due\nin particular to the significantly increased liabilities from advance payments by customers, the\nequity ratio was 73% as at June 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020: 84%).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still posing no significant risk to the AIXTRON Group and our business.\nStrict internal protective measures are in place to ensure safety in operations. This includes the\noffer to all AIXTRON employees to have a COVID-19 screening carried out regularly at work. AIXTRON\nwas also able to offer COVID-19 vaccination to all interested employees in Q2. Approximately half\nof our employees have returned to the office from the mobile office since mid-July this year. The\nimpact of the pandemic on our business remains at a low level and our supply chains are stable.\n5\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON”,\n“the AIXTRON Group” or “the Company”) can be found in the Annual Report 2020. There were no\nchanges in the first half of 2021. The Report is publicly available for download on the Company’s\nwebsite at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON’s R&D capability remains of important strategic significance, as it provides for a\ncompetitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the future business development.\nTherefore, AIXTRON is committed to investing specifically in research and development projects\nto retain or to expand the Company’s leading technology position in MOCVD equipment for\napplications such as lasers, specialty LEDs and for the production of wide-band-gap materials for\npower electronics. In addition, the Group is working on novel 2D nanostructures, which are seen\nas having great potential in research in line with international predictions (roadmaps).\nAn example of the Group’s research work in 2021 is the “NeuroSys - Neuromorphic Hardware\nfor Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Systems” future cluster of RWTH Aachen University and\npartners from the region, honoured by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as\npart of the “Clusters4Future” ideas competition.\nAIXTRON SE is a partner of the future cluster “NeuroSys”, developing, building and optimizing the\nnecessary MOCVD tool for the new application.\n“NeuroSys” researches adaptive and energy-efficient neuromorphic AI chips with the aim of\nallowing intelligent and resource-saving on-site data processing and thus creating an essential\nprerequisite for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Resource-efficient neuromorphic hardware\nthat makes neural networks more efficient and ecologically sustainable while also providing for\ndata security as a design component is considered key to the widespread use of AI, especially\nin autonomous vehicles, medical technology, and sensor networks for intelligent production or\nurban regions. “NeuroSys” aims to work out the crucial prerequisites here. AIXTRON is at the\nbeginning of the value chain in this project. Very thin layers of novel 2D materials, only a few\natomic layers thick, are required as the material base for the neuromorphic chips. The production\nof these materials on the largest possible wafers is AIXTRON’s core competence. As part of this\nand other projects, AIXTRON will develop the world’s most powerful technology platform for the\nindustrial production of these materials and operate it in its laboratory in Herzogenrath.\n6\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEnvironmental protection and the responsible use of resources are also an important part of the\nbusiness strategy. The Company’s engineers work to continuously improve AIXTRON’s equipment\nboth in terms of resource-saving design and environmentally friendly operation. Energy efficiency\nand the yield of chemicals used in the operation of the equipment is an important element in this\nstrategy. Further information can be found in our 2020 Sustainability Report (CSR Report) on the\nAIXTRON website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nEconomic Report\nMacroeconomic developments\nThe global economy is on the road to recovery. This is mainly thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines\nthat are now available, but also to additional fiscal policy stimuli, especially in the USA, which\nfurther strengthen the fiscal and monetary policy measures of the past year. However, at the\nsame time the recovery is taking place at many different speeds - depending, for example,\non access to vaccines, national fiscal and monetary policy options, or the different ways in\nwhich individual economies have been affected, e.g. predominantly production versus tourism-\noriented orientations. For example, the economies of China and the USA, which are especially\nimportant for AIXTRON, have already returned to pre-crisis GDP levels in 2020 or will do so again\nin the current year. Many other countries, particularly emerging and developing countries, are\nnot expected to achieve this until 2022 or even 2023. Nevertheless, the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) now assumes that the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will be less\nthan those of the global financial crisis of 2008. Nevertheless, the development is subject to\nnumerous uncertainties. In this environment, the IMF has significantly raised its growth forecast\nfor the current year in its World Economic Outlook of April 2021. For 2021 as a whole, the IMF\nnow expects global economic output to grow by 6.0% (+0.5 percentage points compared to\nJanuary 2021) after a -3.3% decline in 2020. For the advanced economies, the expected growth\nrate is 5.1% (2020: -4.7%), while the growth rate for emerging and developing economies is\nexpected to be 6.7% (2020: -2.2%). World trade is expected to grow by 8.4% (2020: -8.5%). The\nsituation in the strongly export-oriented German mechanical and plant engineering sector also\ndeveloped correspondingly positively. According to reports by the Verband Deutscher Maschinen-\nund Anlagenbau e. V. (VDMA), after a subdued start to the year the first five months of the year\nhave now seen an increase in incoming orders of 25%.\nDemand for AIXTRON’s products is largely dependent on industry-specific developments, such as\nthe introduction of new applications in IT-infrastructure, in consumer electronics, in the field of\nelectromobility or demand in sub-segments of the global semiconductor market, which remained\nquite robust overall, partly as a result of the digitalization trend, which was reinforced by the\npandemic. In addition, we have access to a stable supply chain without interruption.\n7\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIndustry developments\nLasers that can be produced on AIXTRON systems have a wide range of applications in the fields\nof 3D sensor technology and optical data transmission: According to the market research\ncompany Yole Développement, consumer electronics will be the main driver of demand for\nlasers in 3D sensor technology in the coming years. In addition, edge and surface emitting\nlasers are increasingly being used in the industrial and automotive sectors for 3D sensing.\nYole expects a strong increase in demand for these components by 2024, especially from the\nautomotive industry, as an element for distance measurement in driver assistance systems and\nin autonomous vehicles. The market for lasers for ultra-fast optical data transmission will be\npositively influenced in particular by the increasing use of cloud computing and Internet services\nsuch as video on demand and music streaming as well as by the communication of networked\ndevices via the Internet (“Internet of Things”).\nIn addition, the power electronics sector is a significant growth market for AIXTRON: Power\nsemiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials enable the production of very\ncompact and highly efficient AC-DC and DC-DC converters, which are used in a wide range of\napplications. These range from low power (e.g. power supply of smart phones) to high power\n(e.g. fast charging station for electric vehicles). Power components made of the materials silicon\ncarbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) are gaining market share in the overall market for\npower components at an increasing rate. GaN semiconductor devices are mainly used in low and\nmedium power and voltage applications, such as high-performance and energy-efficient power\nsupplies for smartphones and laptops, wireless charging, and power supplies for servers and other\nIT infrastructure. Furthermore, GaN semiconductor devices are increasingly used in high frequency\napplications such as 5G telecommunication networks. Silicon carbide (SiC) WBG power devices\nare particularly suitable for use in higher power and voltage classes. Areas of application are\nprimarily electric vehicles and their fast-charging stations, but also photovoltaic and wind energy\nconverters and other electric drives. In these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in\nconversion losses, resulting in a greater range per battery charge in vehicles and a higher amount\nof energy delivered in the power generation sector. Due to the wide range of applications and\nhigh efficiency, industry experts expect strong growth for both GaN and SiC devices in the coming\nyears.\nIn the optoelectronics sector, the Micro LEDs segment represents the greatest growth potential\naccording to LEDinside. Potential drivers include large-area screens as well as very small displays\nin various end-uses such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and notebooks. According to\nYole, the market for red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) is also predicted to continue\ngrowing due to the worldwide use of direct emitting, large area LED display walls or backlighting\nunits. Another small segment of the LED market addressed by AIXTRON is the market for UV LEDs.\nThese are used for curing plastics, for disinfecting surfaces, air and water. Due to increased hygiene\nawareness, this market could gain importance in the future. According to LEDinside market will\ngrow at a significant double-digit compound annual growth rate in the coming year.\n8\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe growth forecasts for the market segments described here in detail are listed in the economic\nreport of our Annual Report 2020. We consider these forecasts to remain valid.\nAccording to the current analysis of the market research institute Gartner, AIXTRON saw its global\nmarket leadership for MOCVD equipment confirmed in 2020. Once again, AIXTRON has taken\nthe top position: AIXTRON’s market share was 58%, followed by Veeco (USA) with 26% and AMEC\n(China) with 16%.\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\nH1 2021 H1 2020 +/-\nm EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 263.3 138.4 124.9 90\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 295.0 156.6 138.4 88\nH1/2021 order intake increased by around 90% year-on-year to EUR 263.3 million (H1/2020:\nEUR 138.4 million). This reflects the continued strong demand, especially in the fields of power\nelectronics, data transmission and LEDs. At EUR 139.0 million in Q2 2021, order intake exceeded\nthe already high level of the previous quarter (Q1/2021: EUR 124.4 million) and represented the\nhighest value since 2011. The US dollar-based equipment order intake and equipment order\nbacklog received in the 2021 financial year were translated at the internally determined annual\nbudget rate of 1.25 USD/EUR for comparability reasons (2020: USD/EUR 1.20).\nThe total equipment order backlog as at June 30, 2021 was EUR 295.0 million, also significantly\nhigher than both the previous year (H1/2020: EUR 156.6 million) and the previous quarter (Q1/2021:\nEUR 223.5 million). Most of this order backlog is scheduled for delivery in 2021.\nIn line with a strict internal process, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be met for\nthe recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These conditions include the\nfollowing requirements:\n• the receipt of a firm written purchase order,\n• the receipt of an agreed down payment,\n9\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• accessibility to the required shipping documentation,\n• a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Management Board reserves\nthe right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is sufficiently likely to\noccur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, Management comes to the conclusion that\nthe realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or involves an unacceptable degree of risk,\nManagement will exclude this specific order or a portion of this order from the recorded order\nintake and order backlog figures until the risk has decreased to an acceptable level. The order\nbacklog is regularly assessed and - if necessary - adjusted in line with potential execution risks.\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses denominated\nin US dollars in the first six months of 2021 was 1.21 USD/EUR (Q1/2021: 1.22 USD/EUR; Q2/2021:\n1.20 USD/EUR), which compares to 1.11 USD/EUR in H1/2020. Thus, compared to the same period\nof the previous year, the US dollar was 9% weaker in H1/2021, having a corresponding impact on\nAIXTRON Group’s US dollar denominated revenues and earnings in the period.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues for the first six months of 2021 amounted to EUR 117.2 million and were thus\nEUR 20.2 million or 21% higher year-on-year (H1/2020: EUR 97.0 million). This is mainly the\nresult of the order intake in the relevant period of the previous year, which is now reflected in\nthe revenue development - once the systems have been delivered. Compared to the previous\nquarter, revenues in Q2/2021 increased by 37% to EUR 67.7 million (Q1/2021: EUR 49.5 million).\n61% of the equipment revenue in Q2 was generated particularly with equipment for optical\ndata transmission and 5G applications. Another significant share of sales was contributed by the\nbusiness with systems for power electronics, especially for gallium nitride applications.\nEquipment revenues in H1/2021 were EUR 91.6 million, representing 78% of the total H1/2021\nrevenues (H1/2020: 76.4 million; 79%).

The increased revenue\nvolume compared to the previous year was offset by higher expenses for the preparation of\nproduction capacities for the planned increased output in the second half of the year.\nOperating expenses of EUR 40.2 million increased in H1/2021 compared to the previous year\n(H1/2020: EUR 35.3 million; Q2/2021: EUR 22.3 million; Q1/2021: EUR 18.0 million). The increase in\noperating expenses in the first half of 2021 was due to additional restructuring costs for APEVA\nin the amount of approximately EUR 3.2 million (see chapter “Restructuring costs” in the Notes).\nFurthermore, higher variable remuneration components were incurred in the first half of 2021.\nIn the previous year, a special effect due to a change of use for a production facility led to other\noperating income of EUR 2.9 million.\n11\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nR&D expenses in H1/2021 decreased by EUR 1.9 million to EUR 26.7 million compared to the same\nperiod last year (H1/2020: EUR 28.6 million; Q2/2021: EUR 14.9 million; Q1/2021: EUR 11.9 million).\nwhich is mainly due to lower ongoing costs for the OLED technology, while on the other hand\nrestructuring costs for APEVA amounting to EUR 2.8 million were recorded.\nCompared to the previous quarter, R&D expenses increased from EUR 11.9 million in the first\nquarter to EUR 14.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, mainly due to the restructuring expenses\nmentioned above.\nKey R&D Information\nH1 2021 H1 2020 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 26.7 28.6 -7%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 23 30 -7pp\nNet other operating income and expenses resulted in an operating income of EUR 3.9 million\nin H1/2021 (H1/2020: EUR 8.1 million; Q2/2021: EUR 2.2 million; Q1/2021: EUR 1.7 million income).\nThis reflects in particular R&D grants of EUR 3.5 million. The high positive balance in the first half\nof the previous year was significantly influenced by the above-mentioned special effect from the\nreversal of impairment losses due to the planned change of use of a production facility.\nThe operating result (EBIT) improved year-on-year from EUR 2.2 million in H1 2020 to\nEUR 4.9 million in H1 2021 (Q2/2021: EUR 5.6 million; Q1/2021: EUR -0.7 million). This development\nis mainly due to the year-on-year increase in revenue and the corresponding gross margin and is\nattributable to the business and cost development described above.\nThe result before taxes in H1/2021 was EUR 4.9 million (H1/2020: EUR 2.4 million; Q2/2021:\nEUR 5.6 million; Q1/2021 EUR -0.7 million).\nIn H1/2021, income from income taxes of EUR 6.6 million was reported (H1/2020: income from\nincome taxes EUR 0.1 million, Q2/2021: income from income taxes EUR 2.1 million; Q1/2021:\nincome from income taxes EUR 4.4 million). This development is attributable to the recognition of\nEUR 7.9 million of deferred tax assets expected to be used against future taxable profits.\nThe Company’s net result in H1/2021 amounted to EUR 11.5 million (H1/2020: EUR 2.5 million;\nQ2/2021: EUR 7.7 million; Q1/2021: EUR 3.8m).\n12\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\nTotal equity as of June 30, 2021 increased to EUR 503.2 million compared to EUR 496.4 million\nas of December 31, 2020. The main drivers were the net result and the dividend payment of\nAIXTRON SE. The equity ratio as of June 30, 2021 was 73% compared to 84% as at December 31,\n2020 due to the significant increase in customer prepayments compared to the previous year.\nCash, cash equivalents and other financial assets, increased to EUR 348.2 million as of June\n30, 2021, compared to EUR 309.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The difference is mainly due\nto increased advance payments from customers during the reporting period. Other financial\nassets as at June 30, 2021 include fund investments of EUR 132.4 million (December 31, 2020:\nEUR 62.4 million), short-term bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million (December 31, 2020: EUR 0 million)\nand long-term bank deposits of EUR 0 million (December 31, 2020: EUR 60.0 million). The long-\nterm bank deposits of EUR 60.0 million included as at 31 December 2020 were reclassified to\ncurrent financial assets as at 30 June 2021.\nProperty, plant and equipment as of June 30, 2021, increased slightly to EUR 65.9 million\ncompared to December 31, 2020 (EUR 63.5 million as of December 31, 2020).\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 71.7 million as of June 30, 2021, compared to EUR 71.0 million as\nof December 31, 2020. No impairment losses were recognized in the first six months of 2021. The\ndifference is due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components and work in progress, increased by 59% to\nEUR 125.5 million as of June 30, 2021, compared to EUR 79.1 million as of December 31, 2020,\nreflective of an increase in deliveries planned for subsequent quarters.\nTrade receivables as of June 30, 2021, amounted to EUR 34.7 million (December 31, 2020:\nEUR 41.3 million) and thus mainly reflect the current business volume in the second quarter of\n2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Due to country-specific payment modalities, the\naverage days sales outstanding was 44 days (December 31, 2020: 18 days).\nContract liabilities from advance payments received amounted to EUR 122.5 million as of\nJune 30, 2021, compared to EUR 50.8 million as of December 31, 2020, thus reflecting the current\norder backlog.\n13\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCashflow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in financial assets -\ninvestments + proceeds from disposals) was EUR 46.1 million in H1/2021 (H1/2020: EUR -8.4 million;\nQ2/2021: EUR 18.0 million; Q1/2021: EUR 28.1 million). This development is mainly due to advance\npayments received for customer orders and a simultaneous increase in inventories.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first six months of 2021, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further significant\nadditions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2020 Annual Report. The\nrisks associated with COVID-19 continue to be assessed as not significant because it has been\nshown that demand for our products has not been significantly affected by the pandemic and our\nsupply chains continue to function reliably during lockdown periods.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2020 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nIn particular, AIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end\nuser markets could possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term\n• Increasing adoption of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensor systems in\nmobile devices as well as sensors for infrastructure applications\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for optical data transmission of large volumes, such as\nfor video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) for displays and\nother applications\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based components for energy-efficient\npower electronics devices in autos, in consumer electronics, in mobile devices and in IT\ninfrastructure\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based devices in mobile devices (e. g. smartphones) for 5G mobile\ncommunications or 6E WLAN technology\n• Increasing use of GaN-based devices in the field of 5G network infrastructure\n14\nAIXTRON 2021 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMid- to Long-Term\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated power management\n• Adaptation of Micro LED displays in the mass market\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual-light communication\ntechnology or Micro LED displays\n• Increased use of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for autonomous driving\n• Use of GaN-based devices in mobile terminals (e. g. smartphones) for the millimeter-wave\nrange of 5G and 6G mobile communications\n• Order for production-scale qualification of OVPD technology\n• Increased development activities for high performance solar cells made of compound\nsemiconductor\nOutlook\nBased on the results for the first six months of fiscal year 2021, the order intake development\nin particular, and the internal assessment of the development of demand the Executive Board\nraised its previously issued forecast on June 9 of this year and published this in an ad-\nhoc announcement. Due to the very positive order development, the Executive Board once\nagain increases the forecast for order intake in the 2021 financial year to EUR 440 million to\nEUR 480 million (previously: EUR 420 million to EUR 460 million). The Executive Board reaffirms the\nforecast for the 2021 financial year, which was raised in June, for revenues of EUR 400 million to\nEUR 440 million, a gross margin of around 40% of revenues and an EBIT margin of 20% to 22%\nof revenue. The expectations for 2021 are based on the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic\nwill continue to have no significant impact on the development of business operations.\nIn addition, with a view to the AIXTRON Group’s sustainability goals, which were redefined in\n2020, the Executive Board is aiming for a discernible reduction in energy consumption in the\nmedium term, as well as a significant expansion of further training measures for the employees.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the further development of the global economy\nand the global trade in order to assess any potential effects on AIXTRON’s own supply chain and\nproduction as well as on customer demand and thus on AIXTRON’s business development at any\ntime and - if necessary - to initiate appropriate counter measures.\nFurther details on the annual forecast can be found in the “Expected Developments” section of the\nAnnual Report 2020, which is available on the Company‘s website at

This is in particular due\nto the high demand for equipment for the production of gallium nitride power electronics e.g. for\nhigh-performance chargers, followed by equipment for the production of chips for 5G wireless\ntelecommunications. Q1/2021 sales improved year-on-year and amounted to EUR 49.5 million, up\n21% compared to Q1/2020 (EUR 41.0 million). The strong order development in the past quarter\nand the continued high level of customer inquiry activity in the current quarter support the\nExecutive Board’s expectations for order intake in the full year. As expected, sales and earnings in\nQ1/2021 were below the previous quarter. This was largely due to customer requests for deliveries\nto be made in 2020. As in previous fiscal years, we expect sales and earnings to increase in the\ncoming quarters.\nOrder intake of EUR 124.4 million in Q1/2021 exceeded the figure for the strong previous quarter\n(EUR 92.2 million) and was almost twice as high as in the same quarter of the previous year\n(Q1/2020: EUR 68.8 million). The development is attributable to high demand from various end\nmarkets, especially for GaN power electronics. The equipment order backlog as of March 31,\n2021 has increased to EUR 223.5 million.\nThe development of revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2021 is fully in line with\nexpectations after the very strong previous quarter and is in line with our customers’ delivery\nschedules. Revenues in Q1/2021 increased by 21% to EUR 49.5 million compared to the previous\nyear (Q1/2020: EUR 41.0 million). Gross profit in Q1/2021 was EUR 17.3 million with a gross margin\nof 35% (Q1/2020: EUR 14.6 million; 36%). Operating expenses in Q1/2021 were EUR 18.0 million,\nhigher than the corresponding figure for the previous year (Q1/2020: EUR 15.7 million), mainly\ndue to an effect in Q1/2020 from a reversal of impairment reported in other operating income of\nEUR 2.9 million. With a small negative operating result (EBIT) of EUR -0.7 million and an EBIT\nmargin of -1% (Q1/2020: EUR -1.1 million; -3%), a net profit of EUR 3.8 million (Q1/2020: EUR -0.8\nmillion) was reported in Q1/2021 due to further recognition of deferred tax assets.\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nAIXTRON GROUP\nFree cash flow in Q1/2021 was EUR 28.1 million (Q1/2020: EUR 3.0 million).\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents including financial assets of EUR 341.0m as of\nMarch 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR 309.7m; March 31, 2020: EUR 300.8m). This includes non-\ncurrent bank deposits with a maturity of at least 12 months in the amount of EUR 60.0 million\n(December 31, 2020: EUR 60.0 million; March 31, 2020: nil). Due in particular to the significant\nincrease in liabilities from advance payments by customers, the equity ratio was 77% as of\nMarch 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: 84%).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues not to pose a significant risk to the AIXTRON Group and our\nbusiness. Strict protective measures are in place to ensure safety in operations. A large number\nof our employees use the option of working from home. In addition, AIXTRON SE employees and\nvisitors are given the opportunity to have COVID rapid tests performed at the facility. The impact\non our business remains at a very low level and our supply chains are stable.\nGiven the strong demand and order backlog, we expect to reach the upper end of the 2021\nguidance range for order intake and revenues. We confirm the forecast for gross margin and raise\nthe forecast for EBIT margin to around 18%.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON”,\n“the AIXTRON Group” or “the Company”) can be found in the Annual Report 2020. There were\nno changes in the first quarter of 2021. The Report is publicly available for download on the\nCompany’s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nBusiness Performance and Key Developments\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\nQ1 2021 Q1 2020 +/-\nm EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 124.4 68.8 55.6 81\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 223.5 146.3 77.2 53\nUS dollar based order intake and equipment order backlog received in 2021 were each recorded at\nthe annual budget rate of 1.25 USD/EUR (2020: 1.20 USD/EUR; 2019: 1.20 USD/EUR).\nOrder intake in the first quarter of 2021 increased by around 81% year-on-year and by 35%\ncompared to the strong Q4/2020 to EUR 124.4 million, reflecting the continued strong demand in\nall business areas (Q1/2020: EUR 68.8 million; Q4/2020: EUR 92.2 million).\nThe equipment order backlog as of March 31, 2021 increased to EUR 223.5 million compared to\nEUR 150.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses denominated\nin US dollars in the first three months of 2021 was 1.22 USD/EUR (Q1/2020: 1.11 USD/EUR). Thus,\ncompared to the respective previous year’s figure, the US dollar was 10% weaker, having a\ncorresponding impact on AIXTRON Group’s US dollar denominated revenues and earnings in the\nfirst quarter.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nRevenues of EUR 49.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 were EUR 8.5 million or 21% higher than\nthe previous year‘s figure of EUR 41.0 million (Q4/2020: EUR 108.1 million). More than half of the\nrevenues in the 1st quarter were generated from tools for optoelectronics, in particular for 5G\napplications and optical data transmission. Another significant share of revenues was contributed\nby the power electronics equipment business, in particular for gallium nitride applications.\nEquipment revenues accounted for approximately 77% of total revenues at EUR 38.2 million\ncompared to EUR 29.9 million or 73% in Q1/2020 (Q4/2020: 93.5 million or 86%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nQ1 2021 Q1 2020 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 38.2 77 29.9 73 8.3 28\nRevenues from service, spare parts, etc. 11.4 23 11.0 27 0.4 4\nTotal 49.5 100 41.0 100 8.5 21\nRevenues by Region\nQ1 2021 Q1 2020 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 30.9 62 26.3 64 4.6 17\nEurope 15.0 30 7.1 17 7.9 111\nAmericas 3.6 7 7.5 18 -3.9 -52\nTotal 49.5 100 41.0 100 8.5 21\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nQ1 2021 Q1 2020 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev.\nCost of sales 32.2 65 26.4 64 5.8 22\nGross profit 17.3 35 14.6 36 2.7 18\nOperating costs 18.0 36 15.7 38 2.3 14\nSelling expenses 2.2 4 2.7 7 -0.5 -18\nGeneral and administration expenses 5.6 11 4.8 12 0.9 18\nResearch and development costs 11.9 24 14.4 35 -2.6 -18\nNet other operating (income)\n(1.7) -4 (6.2) -15 -4.4 -72\nand expenses\nGross profit in Q1/2021 was EUR 17.3 million with a gross margin of 35% (Q1/2020: EUR 14.6\nmillion or 36%; Q4/2020: EUR 45.0 million or 42%). As expected, effects from the higher revenue\nvolume compared to the previous year, were partially offset by the impact of the weaker US dollar.\nFurthermore, additional expenses were incurred in Q1/2021 to prepare production capacities for\nthe increased output planned for the second half of the year.\nOperating expenses of EUR 18.0 million increased in Q1/2021 compared to the prior-year quarter\n(Q1/2020: EUR 15.7 million; Q4/2020: EUR 20.5 million). In the Q1/2020, a reversal of impairment\nrelated to a production facility led to other operating income of EUR 2.9 million. Higher variable\nremuneration components also contributed to the increase in operating expenses in Q1/2021.\nCompared to the previous quarter, operating expenses decreased by EUR 2.5 million, mainly due\nto lower running costs for OLED technology.\nR&D expenses in Q1/2021 amounted to EUR 11.9 million (Q1/2020: EUR 14.4 million; Q4/2020:\nEUR 17.2 million). This reflects, on the one hand, our ongoing research activities to develop next\ngeneration MOCVD equipment for various applications and, on the other hand, lower running\ncosts for our OLED technology.\nKey R&D Information\nQ1 2021 Q1 2020 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 11.9 14.4 -17%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 24 35 -9pp\nThe net other operating income and expenses resulted in an income of EUR 1.7 million in\nQ1/2021 (Q1/2020: EUR 6.2 million; Q4/2020: EUR 3.3 million income). This reflects in particular\nR&D grants of EUR 1.7 million. The positive income in Q1/2020 was significantly influenced by the\neffect mentioned above.\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOperating profit (EBIT) improved year-on-year from EUR -1.1 million in Q1/2020 to EUR -0.7\nmillion in Q1/2021 (Q4/2020: EUR 24.5 million). This development mainly results from higher year-\non-year revenues and the corresponding gross margin and is thus attributable to the business and\ncost development described above.\nIn Q1/2021, income from income taxes of EUR 4.4 million was reported (Q1/2020: income\nfrom income taxes EUR 0.1 million, Q4/2020: income from income taxes EUR 0.4 million). This\ndevelopment is attributable to the recognition of EUR 4.5 million of deferred tax assets expected\nto be used against future taxable profits.\nThe net result of the AIXTRON Group in Q1/2021 amounted to EUR 3.8 million (Q1/2020: EUR -0.8\nmillion; Q4/2020: EUR 24.9 million).\nFinancial Position and Net Assets (Highlights)\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\nTotal equity as of March 31, 2021 increased to EUR 505.0 million compared to EUR 496.4 million as\nof December 31, 2020 mainly due to the net result in the reporting period. The equity ratio as of\nMarch 31, 2021 was 77% compared to 84% as at December 31, 2020 due to the significant increase\nin customer prepayments compared to the previous year.\nCash, cash equivalents and other financial assets, increased to EUR 341.0 million as of March\n31, 2021, compared to EUR 309.7 million as of December 31, 2020. In addition to fund investments\nof EUR 117.3 million, the financial assets also include bank deposits with a term of more than\n12 months of EUR 60.0 million, which are included in the balance sheet item other long-term\nfinancial assets. The difference is mainly due to increased advance payments from customers\nduring the quarter.\nProperty, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2021 increased slightly to EUR 65.4 million\ncompared to December 31, 2020 (EUR 63.5 million as of December 31, 2020).\nGoodwill recognized was EUR 71.9 million as of March 31, 2021, compared to EUR 71.0 million as\nof December 31, 2020. No impairment losses were recognized in the first three months of 2021.\nThe difference is due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, components and work in progress, increased by 23% to\nEUR 97.3 million as of March 31, 2021, compared to EUR 79.1 million as of December 31, 2020,\nreflective of an increase in deliveries planned for subsequent quarters.\nTrade receivables as of March 31, 2021 amounted to EUR 42.6 million (December 31, 2020: EUR 41.3\nmillion) which mainly reflects the current business volume. The receivables corresponded to an\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\naverage DSO of 59 days (December 31, 2020: 18 days). The increase to the end of Q1/2021 is due\nto the reporting date and partly to country-specific payment modalities.\nContract liabilities from advance payments received amounted to EUR 100.6 million as of\nMarch 31, 2021, compared to EUR 50.8 million as of December 31, 2020, thus reflecting the current\norder backlog.\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in financial assets\n- investments + proceeds from disposals) amounted to EUR 28.1 million in Q1/2021 (Q1/2020:\nEUR 3.0 million; Q4/2020: EUR 17.3 million). This development is mainly attributable to advance\npayments received for customer orders with a simultaneous build-up of inventories.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first three months of 2021, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further\nsignificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2020 Annual\nReport. The risks associated with COVID-19 continue to be assessed as not significant because\nit has been shown that demand for our products has not been significantly affected by the\npandemic and our supply chains continue to function reliably during lockdown periods.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2020 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nOutlook\nBased on the results for the first three months of financial year 2021 and the internal assessment\nof the demand development, the Executive Board specifies the previously issued full-year\nguidance in terms of order intake and revenues. The expectations for the gross margin\nremain unchanged, whereas the expectations for the EBIT margin have been raised. This\nalso takes into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently not considered to\nbe significant for the AIXTRON Group’s business.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAccordingly, the Executive Board expects the order intake for the financial year 2021 to be at\nthe upper end of the range of EUR 340 million and EUR 380 million. It also expects to reach the\nupper end of the range between EUR 320 million and EUR 360 million in terms of revenue. For\nthe 2021 financial year, the Executive Board still expects to achieve a gross margin of around\n40%. Due to the improved revenue outlook, the Executive Board expects to achieve an EBIT\nmargin of around 18% of revenues (previously: 16%).\nIn addition, with a view to the AIXTRON Group’s sustainability goals, which were redefined in\n2020, we are aiming for a discernible reduction in energy consumption in the medium term, as\nwell as a significant expansion of further training measures for our employees.\nAs the customer discussions initiated with the previous Asian customer after qualification of the\nGen2 deposition system did not lead to the envisaged result, AIXTRON’s subsidiary APEVA is\nnow exploring opportunities in China with its technology for the production of OLED. Together\nwith the joint venture partner H&IRUJA, the commercialisation of the OVPD core technology is\nto be driven forward there. To this end, APEVA will focus on the supply of key components.\nSuccessful conclusion of talks with potential customers in China is not expected before 2022.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the further development of the global economy\nand the global trade in order to assess any potential effects on AIXTRON’s own supply chain and\nproduction as well as on customer demand and thus on AIXTRON’s business development at any\ntime and - if necessary - to initiate appropriate counter measures.\nFurther details on the annual forecast can be found in the “Expected Developments” section of\nthe Annual Report 2020, which is available on the Company’s website at www.aixtron.com/en/\ninvestors/publications.\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\nAs announced, Dr. Bernd Schulte resigned from the Executive Board at the end of his contract\non March 31, 2021 and retired. Also as announced on April 1, 2021, Dr. Felix Grawert has been\nappointed Chairman of the Executive Board. As of May 1, 2021, Dr. Christian Danninger will join the\nAIXTRON Group as the new Chief Financial Officer. Until Dr. Danninger takes office, the Executive\nBoard therefore currently consists of two persons, Dr. Grawert and Dr. Linck. The composition of\nthe Supervisory Board has not changed since December 31, 2020.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2021\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated

We further strengthened our\nposition as market and technology leader for MOCVD equipment and its applications, and met our\nfull-year guidance for 2020. Order intake at EUR 301 million exceeded the previous year‘s figure\nby 30%, revenues at EUR 269 million improved by 4%, and we achieved an operating profit of\nEUR 35 million with an EBIT margin of 13%. Together with a gross margin of 40%, this demonstra-\ntes our strong profitability. The consistently high equity ratio of 84% and our total cash of EUR 310\nmillion (both as of December 31, 2020) underline our financial strength. For the consistent further\ndevelopment of our cutting-edge technology and our product portfolio, we have invested more\nthan one in five euros (22%) of sales in research and development (R&D), at EUR 58 million, even\nin the challenging year 2020.\nWe have focused on the development of next-generation MOCVD systems for our target markets.\nIn this way, we are consistently aligning our product portfolio to the requirements of our custo-\nmers‘ fast-growing markets of the future in order to support them in their growth as an innovative\nand reliable partner.\nIn 2020, demand for our equipment to produce gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for power\nand high-frequency applications grew strongly. These devices allow a significant reduction in\nenergy consumption and size of power supplies for servers, smartphones and notebooks, thus\nenabling a reduction in the carbon footprint. They have also become an important component\nof 5G networks. With this, we expect the beginning of a demand trend that will continue in the\ncoming years. To further expand the appeal of the GaN material system, we have strongly pushed\nthe development of the successor generation of our AIX G5+ product series in 2020.\nOur fully automated deposition system for silicon carbide (SiC), which we launched in 2019, has\nconvinced further customers in 2020. It is consistently aligned to the e-mobility megatrend, for\nwhich the SiC material system with its high energy efficiency enables an increase in vehicle range\nand thus a reduction in the carbon footprint. Here, too, we expect further growth in the coming\nyears.\nThe display business has shown strength in 2020, which we expect to continue in the near future.\nCustomers are continuously expanding their capacities for the production of Mini LEDs and are\nworking intensively on the development and qualification of Micro LEDs for the next generation\nof displays for smartwatches, smartphones and TV sets. In order to better meet the requirements\nof these growth markets in the future as well, we also further developed our new MOCVD system\ngeneration for red LEDs and lasers in 2020. It will be delivered to the first customers in the course\nof 2021.\n6\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nIn the field of OLED deposition technologies, our subsidiary APEVA has received final acceptance\nof the Gen 2 OVPD® deposition system from the customer. This phase of the qualification project\non the way to commercialization of APEVA‘s proprietary technology has been completed. APEVA is\ncurrently in talks with customers about a final qualification project for series production.\nOverall, AIXTRON has sustainably strengthened its market position in numerous growth markets\nduring 2020, especially in the IT infrastructure, electro mobility and consumer electronics sectors.\nWe have had a large number of successes in our cooperation with customers. We also increased\nour research and development targeted to strengthen our positioning in the diverse growth mar-\nkets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the dominant global event in 2020, also presented us with challenges.\nWe implemented a comprehensive hygiene concept at an early stage and made even greater use\nof the opportunities offered by digitization, including our Annual General Meeting, which was\nheld virtually for the first time. As a result, the infection rate has remained at a very low level at\nAIXTRON, enabling us to avoid any meaningful productivity bottlenecks.\nIn 2020, we have again made great steps forward in successfully placing our technologies in the\ngrowth markets we address and positioning ourselves accordingly with a strong competitive\nedge. In 2021, we will accelerate our pace even further - despite all challenges we will have to\nface in 2021.\nOur Executive Board Members Dr. Jochen Linck, Dr. Bernd Schulte and Dr. Felix Grawert (from left to right).\n7\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nOur employees are crucial to our success. Without their commitment, their dedication and also\ntheir responsible behavior during the pandemic, this success would not have been possible. We\nwould like to expressly thank our employees for this! We would also like to thank our Supervisory\nBoard for its trusting cooperation in the strategic development and support in the management\nof the company.\nUnfortunately, the news reached us in January of this year that our company founder, long-time\nManaging Director and Chairman of the Board, Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and\nHonorary Chairman of the Supervisory Board Dr. Holger Jürgensen passed away at the age of 63.\nWe mourn the passing of a visionary who, with his pioneering technological spirit and entrepre-\nneurial vision, laid the foundations for today‘s world-leading Group.\nWe thank our shareholders for their trust. With your support, we can continue to develop AIXTRON\nas a sustainably successful and profitable company with great growth potential in the semicon-\nductor industry.\nDr. Jochen Linck Dr. Bernd Schulte Dr. Felix Grawert\n8\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nSupervisory Board Report\nIn fiscal year 2020, the employees of the AIXTRON Group showed extraordinary performance.\nThanks to the great common commitment, all targets set for the year were achieved, despite the\ndifficult environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, AIXTRON showed a robust\ndevelopment of its operating business in this challenging year.\nDemand for AIXTRON equipment today and in the future is strongly influenced by global trends\nsuch as increasing electromobility and its efficiency, expansion of renewable energies, digita-\nlization, and networking. Efficient power semiconductors as components for electric vehicles,\ncompact power supplies, data centers, or power generation from renewable sources are driving\ndemand for our equipment. Further growth is also expected in the optoelectronics sector due to\nthe increasing proliferation of optical sensors and rising demand for optical data transmission. In\nall these markets, AIXTRON has established an excellent position thanks to leading technologies.\nAIXTRON will systematically exploit the resulting opportunities.\nAPEVA‘s joint OLED project with a major customer reached an important milestone in Q4 2020:\nWith the final acceptance of the Gen2 deposition system commissioned in the previous year by\nthe customer, this phase of the qualification project on the way to commercialization of APEVA‘s\nproprietary technology has been completed. APEVA is currently in talks with customers about a\nfinal qualification project for series production.\nSustainability plays a central role in AIXTRON‘s mindset and actions. Since 2019, AIXTRON has been\na climate-neutral Company, and further measures to reduce CO2 emissions were implemented in\nfiscal year 2020.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Jochen Linck to the Executive Board of\nAIXTRON SE as Chief Operating Officer (COO) and resolved to expand the Executive Board by a\nChief Financial Officer to three permanent members. With the appointment of Dr. Christian Dan-\nninger to the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as of July 1, 2021, AIXTRON SE‘s Executive\nBoard succession process was successfully completed in December 2020.\nThroughout the reporting year, the Supervisory Board performed the duties and responsibilities\nentrusted to it by law, the Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure without limitation.\n9\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nCooperation between the Supervisory Board and the\nExecutive Board\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored the Executive Board in its management of the\nCompany and advised it on all matters of importance to the Company, so that the Supervisory\nBoard was always able to verify the legality and regularity, expediency, and economic efficiency\nof the Company‘s management.\nThe Supervisory Board was directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental im-\nportance to the Company. The Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board regularly, prompt-\nly, and comprehensively about the course of business, corporate planning, and the strategic de-\nvelopment of the AIXTRON Group. In addition, the Supervisory Board regularly consulted with the\nExecutive Board on the Company‘s risk situation, risk management, and compliance. Based on\nthe Executive Board‘s reports, business developments and events of importance to the Company\nwere discussed in detail. The Supervisory Board approved the respective resolution proposals of\nthe Executive Board after thorough examination and consultation.\nThe Supervisory Board did not make use of the opportunity to review the Company‘s books and\nrecords (§ 111 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)).\nCooperation with the Executive Board was characterized in every aspect by responsible and tar-\ngeted action. The Executive Board fully complied with its reporting obligations to the Supervisory\nBoard, both verbally and in writing.\nAs Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I was in regular contact with the Executive Board even be-\nyond the Supervisory Board meetings. In addition to the current business situation and important\nbusiness transactions, we discussed questions of strategic realignment.\nFocus of the Discussion in Plenary Sessions\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board held four ordinary meetings on February 26, May 19, September\n21, and December 9, at all but two of which all acting Supervisory Board members were present.\nFrits van Hout was unable to attend the February 26 meeting in person but was connected by\ntelephone for the resolutions. At the May 19 meeting, the Supervisory Board members, with the\nexception of Chairman Kim Schindelhauer, participated by audio and video conference to avoid\nCOVID-19 infection risks. Prof. Dr. Biagosch was unable to attend the December 9 meeting for\npersonal reasons. He explicitly agreed to all resolutions made in the follow-up.\nPrior to these meetings, all Supervisory Board members received detailed quarterly reports on\nthe Company‘s situation, as well as other information, such as internal control reports, meeting\nminutes, Company presentations, analyst reports, consensus estimates, press releases, and the\nAIXTRON financial reports or financial notifications. These are made available via an encrypted\ndigital platform specially set up for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board obtained a\n10\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nreasonable picture of the business situation before and during the meetings based on current\nfinancial figures as well as updated forecast reports and development plans (orders, revenues,\ncompetition, marketshares). Deviations in the course of business from the planned budgets were\nexplained and justified in detail.\nIn view of the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders‘ Rights Directive (ARUG II), which came\ninto force at the beginning of 2020, and the associated introduction of the revised German Cor-\nporate Governance Code 2020 (DCGK 2020), a Remuneration Committee was formed within the\nSupervisory Board to deal with the revision of the Executive Board remuneration system. In ad-\ndition, the wording of the Rules of Procedure for the Executive Board was amended to reflect the\nregulation on transactions requiring approval.\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board was intensively involved in the development progress of new\nequipment generations, in order to optimally seize the opportunities arising from the imminent\ngrowth in the future markets addressed by AIXTRON in a targeted manner to ensure the sustaina-\nble and profitable business development of the Company.\nOn April 20 and December 9, extraordinary Supervisory Board meetings were held to discuss\nthe appointment and remuneration of the newly created COO and CFO positions.\nSupervisory Board Meetings in 2020\nThe meeting on February 26, 2020 focused on the annual and consolidated financial statements\nand the combined management report for fiscal year 2019 and the corresponding discussions and\nresolutions. We also discussed the draft agenda for the 2020 Annual General Meeting, which we\napproved after clarification of outstanding items. The agenda for the 2020 Annual General Mee-\nting included for the first time a resolution on the approval of a new remuneration system for\nExecutive Board members in accordance with the requirements of the EU Shareholder Rights Di-\nrective (ARUG II). Furthermore, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the proposed Cor-\nporate Governance Report. The non-financial report of AIXTRON SE and the Group (CSR report) for\nfiscal year 2019 to be prepared by AIXTRON and reviewed by the auditor was reviewed, discussed,\nand approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to extend the Executive Board service\ncontract with Dr. Felix Grawert by five years based on the new remuneration system, which would\nbe presented to the General Meeting for approval.\nIn the meeting on May 19, 2020, the Executive Board explained the business development for\nthe current year and reported on the measures implemented to deal with the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed in detail the strategy and roadmap of the\nAIXTRON Group in view of the realignment and continuous development of the technology portfo-\nlio. In particular, the addressable markets for MOCVD technologies for GaN- and SiC-based power\nelectronics applications, as well as the development in the optoelectronics market, including the\nopportunities for Micro LED Displays, were subject to in-depth discussion. It was noted that the\nGaN-based power electronics market is currently in transition from an R&D market to an applica-\ntion market, with the first end-use applications, such as for wireless charging, already entering\n11\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nvolume production. Regarding SiC-based power electronics, it was pointed out that electromo-\nbility will become a major driver of demand when the second generation of pure e-vehicles\nenters volume production. Furthermore, possible approaches to use AIXTRON‘s know-how for the\ndevelopment of new business areas were discussed. This was followed by a report on the status\nof the OLED project of the subsidiary APEVA.\nDuring the ordinary meeting on September 21, 2020, the Executive Board reported on the busi-\nness development in the first half of the year and provided an outlook for the full year 2020. We\nreceived an update on the corporate strategy and the development planning of various applicati-\nons and uses in the optoelectronics technology area. In addition, the Executive Board reported on\nthe status of APEVA‘s business activities and informed us about the status in some strategy pro-\njects. The Supervisory Board adopted the updated Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board,\nwhich came into force at the end of the meeting.\nOn December 9, 2020, the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE met for its last ordinary meeting of\nthe year. The budget for 2021 presented by the Executive Board was discussed in detail and ap-\nproved. The 2021 budget includes, among other things, the detailed revenue, earnings, financial\nand investment planning as well as the planned personnel development of the AIXTRON Group.\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board discussed the agenda for the next Annual General Meeting\non May 19, 2021. Finally, each member of the Supervisory Board underwent a self-evaluation of\ntheir Supervisory Board activities, with the result that the Supervisory Board and its committees\nwork efficiently. In addition, I informed the Supervisory Board that I had approved Dr. Schulte‘s\nacceptance of the Supervisory Board mandate at SUSS MicroTec SE.\nCommittees\nThe Supervisory Board has formed four committees, an Audit Committee, a Capital Markets Com-\nmittee, a Nomination Committee, and a Remuneration Committee. They prepare resolutions and\nissues to be dealt with in the plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board.\nThe Audit Committee deals with the monitoring of accounting, the accounting process, corporate\ngovernance & compliance, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management\nsystem, the internal audit system and the audit of the financial statements. The Chairwoman\nof the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Anna Gersbacher, as a member of the Supervisory Board, has\nexpertise in the areas of accounting and auditing (§ 107 (4), § 100 (5) of the German Stock Cor-\nporation Act (AktG)) as well as special knowledge and experience in the application of internal\ncontrol procedures.\nIn the year under review, the Supervisory Board commissioned Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprü-\nfungsgesellschaft, as proposed by the Audit Committee, with the audit of the annual and con-\nsolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report of AIXTRON SE as of\nDecember 31, 2020, the audit of the Company‘s early risk detection system within the meaning of\n§ 91 (2) AktG, the preparation of a „Management Letter“, the findings pursuant to Section 7.2.3 of\nthe German Corporate Governance Code and, pursuant to § 111 (2) AktG, with the content review\n12\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nof the separate Group non-financial report to be prepared for 2020. In addition, the key audit\nmatters (KAM) to be mentioned in the auditor‘s report on the AIXTRON Annual and Consolidated\nFinancial Statements 2020 were discussed with the auditor.\nThe Audit Committee met four times in 2020 (February 26, May 19, September 21, December 8).\nAll members of the Audit Committee attended the meetings in person or by video link. For the\nquarterly financial statements as of March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, the\nAudit Committee held discussions with the auditors and accounting representatives in each case\nand discussed the publication of the quarterly figures in detail with the Executive Board. In ad-\ndition to the above-mentioned tasks and the quarterly accounting issues, the Audit Committee\ndealt with the following special topics, among others:\n• Declaration of independence and ongoing monitoring of auditor independence\n• Group non-financial report (sustainability report)\n• Compliance training plan for 2020\n• Internal audits 2020 and audit plan for the following year\n• Information security - status and focus topics in 2020\n• Internal (accounting-related) control system\n• Extension of risk management and compliance to APEVA Group incl. JV partners\n• Tax audits, particularly at AIXTRON SE\n• Assessment of the quality of the audit of the financial statements\nThe Capital Market Committee is concerned with the evaluation of activities with potential ca-\npital market relevance. It consists of two members. No meetings were held in 2020.\nThe Nomination Committee consists of three members and makes appropriate proposals to the\nfull Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to the corporate bodies. In doing so, it\nalso considers the targets for the composition of the corporate bodies defined for the first time in\n2010 and renewed in the reporting year.\nIn 2020, the Nomination Committee met eight times, on March 12, April 2, April 9, April 20, August\n18, September 2, September 20, and December 9. These meetings, the majority of which were\nheld by telephone, were attended by all members of the Nomination Committee and invited\nguests. These meetings were all related to the election of candidates to be appointed for the\nnew Executive Board positions of COO and CFO.\nIn the past fiscal year, issues relating to the Remuneration Committee were addressed at the\nmeetings of the Nomination Committee. This was considered reasonable as the members of both\ncommittees are identical, and the main issues concerned the remuneration of the new members\nof the Executive Board.\n13\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nCorporate Governance and Declaration of Conformity\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitors the development of corporate governance stan-\ndards and prepares a joint corporate governance report together with the Executive Board. We\nwill continue to support the Executive Board in its efforts to fully comply with the recommenda-\ntions of the German Corporate Governance Code.\nIn the current Declaration of Conformity pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n(AktG) dated February 4, 2020, full compliance with the recommendations of the German Corpo-\nrate Governance Code is declared, except for the deviations explained.\nNo conflicts of interest involving members of the Supervisory Board or Executive Board were\nreported in the fiscal year.\nAudit and Annual Financial Statements\nPursuant to the resolution of the general shareholders meeting on May 20, 2020, the Supervisory\nBoard commissioned Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf, with the audit\nof the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the com-\nbined management report of AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2020.\nThe audits also covered the measures taken by the Executive Board to identify risks at an early\nstage that could jeopardize the success and continued existence of the Company, as well as the\nlawful, proper, and appropriate reporting of non-financial information in the Sustainability Report\nfor 2020. It was also agreed that the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board or make a note\nin the audit report if, during the performance of the audit, it ascertains facts that show a missta-\ntement in the Declaration of Conformity issued by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in\naccordance with § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). As in previous years, such a\ndetermination was not necessary for the 2020 fiscal year.\nThe annual financial statements and the management report of AIXTRON SE as of December 31,\n2020 were prepared in accordance with the rules of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the\nconsolidated financial statements and the group management report as of December 31, 2020\nwere prepared in accordance with § 315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting\nStandards IFRS. The independent auditing Company Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-\nschaft audited both the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements\nand combined management report prepared by AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2020 and reviewed the\nseparate Group non-financial report. Both the financial statements and the non-financial consoli-\ndated report were issued with an unqualified auditor‘s report or opinion. The auditors found that\nthe combined management report of the Company and the Group accurately presents the current\nbusiness and future development of the Company and the Group.\n14\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nThe audit of the financial statements of AIXTRON SE in fiscal year 2020 by Deloitte GmbH Wirt-\nschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was performed by the audit team with the lead auditor Mr. André\nBedenbecker.\nThe financial statement documents (annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE and consolida-\nted financial statements as of December 31, 2020 as well as the combined management report\nof AIXTRON SE and the Group), the separate Group non-financial report as well as the auditor‘s\nreports were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.\nThese documents were reviewed in detail by us. In the meeting of the Audit Committee and the\nfull Supervisory Board on February 22, 2021, both the annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE\nand the consolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report and the\nGroup non-financial report were discussed and debated in detail, considering the audit reports\nof the auditor. The auditor, who attended both the Audit Committee meeting and the Supervisory\nBoard meeting, reported on the main results of its audit, which also included the internal control\nand risk management system regarding the accounting process, and was available to the Audit\nCommittee and the Supervisory Board, respectively, for any additional questions and information.\nThe results of our own review did not give rise to any objections either to the Group non-financial\nreport or to the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the com-\nbined management report. The combined management report is consistent with our own assess-\nment of the situation of the Company and the Group. We concurred with the auditor‘s findings,\nwith which we fully agreed in terms of content, and approved the annual financial statements\nand the consolidated financial statements as well as the combined management report prepared\nby the Executive Board, as well as the Group non-financial report of the Company for fiscal year\n2020, by resolution dated February 24, 2021. The annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE are\nthus formally adopted.\n15\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nNote of thanks from the Supervisory Board\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Executive Board\nand all employees worldwide for their extraordinary dedication in fiscal 2020, which was marked\nby the COVID-19 pandemic. The entire Supervisory Board would also like to thank the employee\nrepresentatives for their constructive cooperation with the corporate bodies of the Company in\nthis challenging year.\nHerzogenrath, February 2021\nAIXTRON SE\nKim Schindelhauer\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n16\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nThe AIXTRON share is listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and is included\nin the two benchmark indices MDAX and TecDAX of Deutsche Börse AG. According to the index\nranking of Deutsche Börse the AIXTRON share is ranked 57th in the MDAX, which comprises 60\nstocks, in terms of market capitalization as of December 31, 2020 (December 2019: 22nd place in\nthe SDAX) and 49th in terms of transaction volume in 2020 (2019: 3rd place in the SDAX). Among\nthe 30 TecDAX members, AIXTRON’s shares ranked 22nd (2019: 26th) in terms of market capitali-\nzation and 19th (2019: 18th) in terms of transaction volume for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition to traditional trading venues such as XETRA and the German regional stock exchanges,\nAIXTRON shares are also traded to a not inconsiderable extent on other trading platforms such as\nTradegate, Quotrix and Chi-X Europe.\nAIXTRON Share Price Development and Trading Volumes during 2020\nAIXTRON TecDAX SDAX MDAX\nAIXTRON share in € January 2, 2020 = 100%\n15.16 170\n14.27 160\n13.38 150\n12.50 140\n11.60 130\n10.70 120\n9.81 110\n8.92 100\n8.03 90\n7.14 80\n6.25 70\n5.35 60\n4.46 50\nJan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20\nVolume Quotes increased Quotes decreased\nShares\n4,29M\n2,86M\n1,43M\n0\nJan 20 Feb 20 Mar 20 Apr 20 May 20 Jun 20 Jul 20 Aug 20 Sep 20 Oct 20 Nov 20 Dec 20\n17\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nAIXTRON stock withstands COVID-19 pandemic\nThe trading year 2020 was dominated worldwide by the COVID-19 pandemic, the respective con-\ntainment measures and the consequences for global economic development. Towards the end of\nthe year, the widely observed presidential election in the USA also had an increasing impact on\nshare prices. The pandemic led to a sharp rise in demand for digital services of all kinds, with the\nresult that particularly technology stocks continued their upward trend of recent years. However,\nmany other share prices and indices also left their annual lows of March 2020 well behind them\nand in some cases even ended the trading year with price gains. This was mainly due to sustai-\nned investment pressure from the high level of liquidity in the market supported by the central\nbanks. In addition, positive news on vaccine developments and hopes of an imminent economic\nrecovery had a beneficial effect. Particularly on the last trading days of the year, the start of vac-\ncinations in important countries such as the USA, the UK and also Germany once again provided\na significant boost to share prices.\nAt the end of the year, the leading German index DAX was slightly above the previous year‘s level\nand thus in the midfield of the world‘s major stock exchanges. The COVID-19 shock in February\nand March, which caused the DAX to lose almost 40% of its value within three weeks, was follo-\nwed by a recovery lasting several months, which brought the index back up to the previous year‘s\nlevel with major fluctuations. Investors were constantly torn between future economic hope\nand poor current economic conditions - this also depending on the development of the infection\nfigures. In the second half of the year, the DAX moved mostly sideways within a comparatively\nnarrow range. Thanks to the positive investor sentiment at the end of the year, the DAX ended\nthe year 2020 with a slight increase of 3.5%.\n18\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nThe AIXTRON share price already clearly outperformed the general stock market environment at\nthe beginning of the year, thanks to positive analyst comments and a good business outlook.\nHowever, the share could not escape the general COVID-19 crash, during which it reached its low\nfor the year of EUR 6.26 on March 19. As our business subsequently proved to be very robust, the\nshare price also clearly outperformed in the subsequent recovery and rose to an interim high of\nEUR 12.38 by July 20 in the run-up to the announcement of the results for the first half of 2020.\nDemand for lasers for optical data transmission as well as demand for particularly energy-effi-\ncient power electronics or specialty LEDs for display and disinfection applications were among the\ndrivers of our order development. Although good quarterly figures, as expected, were repeatedly\nused for profit-taking, positive analyst comments and the successful completion of Phase II of the\njoint OLED project with one of the world‘s largest display manufacturers gave the share another\nsignificant boost at the end of the year. Thus, the share price also reached its high for the year\nof EUR 14.53 on December 28. Overall, the AIXTRON share price significantly outperformed the\noverall market, with a 67.3% gain for the year to a closing price of EUR 14.27 (2019 year-end price\nof EUR 8.53). In comparison, the MDAX and TecDAX indices did not improve quite as strongly until\nthe end of 2020 with 30,796 points (+8.8% compared to 28,313 points) and 3,123 points (+6.6%\ncompared to 3,015 points), respectively, but nonetheless enjoyed a pleasing end to this difficult\ntrading year.\n19\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nTHE AIXTRON SHARE\nBroadly Diversified Shareholder Structure\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 20% of AIXTRON shares were held by private individuals\n(2019: 30%), most of whom are domiciled in Germany. Approximately 79% of AIXTRON’s outs-\ntanding shares were held by institutional investors (2019: 69%). The majority of institutional in-\nvestors are located in North America (34%), followed by United Kingdom and Ireland (32%) and\nGermany (16%). The remaining investors came from other parts of Europe and the world. At the\nend of 2020, the largest shareholders according to the received voting rights notifications were T.\nRowe Price International, Artisan Partners and Invesco, each holding more than 5% of AIXTRON\nshares through their funds. 99% of the shares were in free float as defined by Deutsche Börse\nand approximately 1% of AIXTRON’s shares were held by the Company.\nAccording to the voting rights notifications and public disclosures pursuant to § 33 para. 1 WpHG,\nthe following institutional investors held shares of more than 3% in AIXTRON SE at the end of\n2020:\n• T.

Our investor relations work is aimed at strengthening confidence in\nour shares in the long term and achieving a fair valuation on the capital market. To this end, we\nprovide our shareholders and the capital market with accurate, timely and relevant information\nabout the AIXTRON Group’s business and our market environment. In addition, AIXTRON is com-\nmitted to complying with the principles of good corporate governance.\nIn individual or group discussions at investor roadshows and conferences our management and\ninvestor relations team answered questions from national and international investors and finan-\ncial analysts on the AIXTRON Group’s business strategy and development as well as industry and\nmarket trends. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in spring 2020, these roadshows\nand conferences were held exclusively virtually.\nDespite the shift of all investor relations activities to virtual platforms, the AIXTRON Executive\nBoard and Investor Relations team communicated just as intensively with the global financial\ncommunities as in the previous year, even though the personal contacts created during Company\nvisits, investor conferences, and roadshows could not be completely replaced. In total, over 200\nmeetings, telephone calls and conference calls were held with financial market participants in\nfiscal year 2020.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated contact restrictions, the General Meeting of\nAIXTRON SE also took place in virtual form for the first time on May 20, 2020. The Annual General\nMeeting, which was streamed completely live on the internet for shareholders, was followed on-\nline by more than 300 shareholders and interested persons. 56.9 percent of the share capital was\nrepresented. The Executive Board provided a comprehensive overview of the results for the 2019\nfinancial year, the first quarter of 2020, and the Group‘s technologies, and answered the questions\nsubmitted by shareholders in advance of the Annual General Meeting.\n22\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDeclaration of Corporate Governance\nAIXTRON is committed to the principles of transparent, responsible corporate governance aimed\nat creating sustainable value. Through appropriate management and supervision of the Company,\nwe - the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board - aim to underpin the trust placed in us by\nour shareholders, the financial markets, our customers, business partners, employees and the\ngeneral public. We are convinced that good corporate governance is an essential basis for the\nsuccess of our Company.\nThe declaration of corporate governance in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)\nas well as the current joint declaration of conformity by the Executive Board and the Supervisory\nBoard in accordance with § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) are published in the\nAnnual Report and on the AIXTRON website in German and English language.\nDeclaration of Conformity\nThe German Corporate Governance Code was revised on December 16, 2019 and became the\nbasis for the Declaration of Conformity upon publication in the Federal Gazette on March 20,\n2020 (“DCGK 2020”). The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE declare that\nAIXTRON SE has complied with the recommendations of the DCGK 2020 and will continue to com-\nply with them in the future, in each case with the following exception:\nConsideration for the Chairmanship and Deputy Chairmanship of the Super-\nvisory Board as well as the Chairmanship and Membership of Committees in\nSupervisory Board Compensation (G.17 DCGK 2020)\nAccording to G.17 DCGK 2020, Supervisory Board compensation shall take into account the Chair\nand Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board as well as the Chair and membership of committees.\nThe Supervisory Board compensation resolved by the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2018\nonly takes into account the chairmanship and deputy chairmanship of the Supervisory Board and\nthe chairmanship of the Audit Committee in addition to membership of the Supervisory Board.\nFurther consideration of the deputy chairmanship of the Audit Committee and a chairmanship\nand deputy chairmanship of the other committees is not considered appropriate, as the time\nand effort involved in these activities is already adequately covered by the Supervisory Board\ncompensation.\nFurthermore, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE declare that\nAIXTRON SE has complied with the recommendations of the version of the German Corporate\n23\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nGovernance Code dated February 7, 2017 (“DCGK 2017”) applicable until March 20, 2020, with the\nfollowing exceptions (in addition to the deviation from recommendation No. 5.4.6 para. 1 senten-\nce 2 DCGK 2017 already described above, which corresponds to recommendation G.17 DCGK 2020):\nComposition of the Executive Board (4.2.1 Sentence 1 DCGK 2017)\nAccording to Section 4.2.1 Sentence 1 of the DCGK 2017 recommends that the Executive Board\nshould consist of several persons and have a chairman or spokesman. The Executive Board of\nAIXTRON SE consisted of two persons in the past fiscal year until September 30, 2020, and was\nexpanded by one person as of October 1, 2020. A chairman or spokesman of the board was not\nappointed for the fiscal year 2020. In the course of the expansion of the Executive Board, the\nSupervisory Board has appointed Dr. Grawert as Chairman of the Executive Board with effect from\nApril 1, 2021.\nMaximum limits for Executive Board remuneration\n(4.2.3 para. 2 Sentence 6 DCGK 2017)\nAccording to Section 4.2.3 para. 2 sentence 6 DCGK 2017, the remuneration of the members of\nthe Executive Board as a whole and with regard to its variable remuneration components should\nhave maximum limits in terms of amounts. The total remuneration of the members of the Exe-\ncutive Board of AIXTRON SE under the previous remuneration system, which was still applicable\nin the period relevant here until March 20, 2020, includes both a fixed remuneration and various\nvariable remuneration components. Accordingly, the variable remuneration is limited with regard\nto the variable bonus for the entire Executive Board to a maximum of EUR 6.5 million, whereby in\nthe case of the commitment to shares the point in time of the commitment is decisive, i. e. any\nincreases in value of the shares after their transfer to the Executive Board member are possible\nin excess of the aforementioned maximum limit.\nThe current remuneration system, which applies to Executive Board contracts signed after March\n20, 2020, provides for maximum limits in terms of amount.\nStandard limit for length of service on the Supervisory Board and age limit\nfor Supervisory Board members (5.4.1 para. 2 Sentence 2 DCGK 2017)\nAccording to Section 5.4.1 (2) Sentence 2 DCGK 2017, the Supervisory Board shall specify concrete\nobjectives for its composition which, with due regard to the Company-specific situation, shall take\ninto account, among other things, a standard limit to be specified for the length of membership of\nthe Supervisory Board. An optimum length of membership is difficult to define and the Supervi-\nsory Board considers it advantageous to retain the experience and knowledge currently available\non the Board. This includes, for example, many years of knowledge of the Company and the niche\nmarkets addressed by the Company as well as comprehensive knowledge of capital market and\n24\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nfinancially relevant issues of a globally positioned Group. The Supervisory Board has therefore not\nset a regular limit for the length of membership of the Supervisory Board in the relevant period.\nHerzogenrath, February 22, 2021\nAIXTRON SE\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE\nDr. Jochen Linck Dr. Bernd Schulte Dr. Felix Grawert\nFor the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE\nKim Schindelhauer\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n25\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation on Corporate Governance Practices\nCompliance Management\nSince 2006, AIXTRON SE has had a Code of Ethics for Executive Board members and certain\nmanagers in finance. The aim of this Code is to promote upright and ethical conduct, including\nthe ethical handling of conflicts of interest, the complete, fair, precise, timely and transparent\ndisclosure of quarterly and annual reports, compliance with prevailing laws, rules and regulations\nand the immediate internal reporting of breaches of the Code where necessary and to ensure\naccountability for compliance with the Code. The complete text of the Code can be found on the\nAIXTRON website under “Code of Ethics” in the Investors/Corporate Governance section.\nIn addition, a Compliance Code of Conduct applies to the Executive and Supervisory Boards, to\nthe senior management team as well as all to employees Group-wide, holding them accounta-\nble for conscientious conduct in conformity with the law. Among the topics addressed, this Code\ncovers the following issues: responsibility and respect towards people and the environment,\ncompliance with the legal conditions, legal and ethical conduct by each individual employee, loy-\nalty to the Company, fair and respectful treatment of fellow employees, rejection of any form of\ndiscrimination, dealing responsibly with corporate risks, acting in an environmentally responsible\nmanner, security in all operating areas, working in a professional manner, reliability and fairness\nin all business relationships, compliance with guidelines on giving/accepting unfair advantages,\ndealing with insider information and the treatment of Company property. The full texts of the\nCompliance Code of Conduct can be downloaded from the AIXTRON website in the Investors/\nCorporate Governance section under “Code of Conduct”.\nFurthermore, AIXTRON issued a Group-wide Compliance Manual in 2010 which applies to all\nmembers of the Executive and Supervisory Boards as well as senior management and which is\nbased on the principles of the Compliance Code of Conduct. The Compliance Manual provides de-\ntailed explanations on the compliance organization at AIXTRON, the legal and regulatory require-\nments and on the resulting conduct requirements applicable to the Executive Board, Supervisory\nBoard, senior management and employees. This Compliance Manual is regularly updated to ref-\nlect new/amended legal and regulatory requirements as well as Company internal specifications,\nmost recently in January 2021. The teaching of the contents is an elementary component of the\nCompany-wide compliance training offer. Compliance training is mandatory for members of the\nsenior management team as well as for all other employees of the Group. This is controlled and\nmonitored by our Compliance Office.\nIn addition, every quarter, the Group-wide members of the senior management as well as select\nkey staff members declare in writing that the compliance requirements were observed in their\narea of responsibility. If the Compliance Manual has been updated, they also declare that they will\ntake note of the updated version and follow and communicate its contents within their area of re-\nsponsibility. In addition, management principles were defined for the Company’s senior managers\nwhich include what is required of senior managers when dealing with employees.\n26\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAIXTRON has a whistleblower system. Notifications of violations of legal, regulatory and internal\nCompany requirements can be sent confidentially to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of\nAIXTRON SE via a specified e-mail address or in the form of a letter. The Chairman of the Supervi-\nsory Board decides together with the Compliance Department, depending on the subject matter\nand scope of the report, whether to involve other persons and/or bodies. In the event of proven\nviolations or grievances, the involved persons/body will work out proposed solutions with the\naim of a prompt remedy, including any necessary sanctions and improvements to the manage-\nment and monitoring processes. Any reports or indication received will be treated discreetly,\nconfidentially and anonymously by the persons/bodies involved. AIXTRON will not impose any\nreprisals against employees who report violations.\nFurthermore, AIXTRON has established a Vendor Code of Conduct, which defines ethical, moral\nand legal standards related to the purchase and use of what are known as conflict minerals (gold,\ntantalum, tungsten, tin) within the AIXTRON supply chain. The key content of this code includes\ninformation on U.S. rules regarding the use of conflict minerals, the expectations placed on sup-\npliers and the consequences in the event of non-compliance.\nThe full text of the Vendor Code of Conduct can be accessed on the AIXTRON website in the Com-\npany/Suppliers/Compliance section or in the Supplier Management section respectively.\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board Operating Procedures as\nwell as Composition and Mode of Operation of Committees\nAIXTRON SE is a European stock Company (Societas Europaea) and is subject not only to the Ger-\nman stock corporation law but also to the superordinate European SE regulations and the German\nSE Implementation Act. The Company has a dual management and control structure consisting of\nan Executive Board and a Supervisory Board.\nThe Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company and informs the Supervisory Board\nregularly, comprehensively and without delay about all relevant issues involving strategy, plan-\nning, business development, the risk situation, risk management and compliance.\nThe Supervisory Board appoints the Executive Board members and oversees and advises the\nExecutive Board in its management duties. To perform certain transactions and measures speci-\nfied in the Articles of Association of AIXTRON SE or the Executive Board’s Rules of Procedure, the\nExecutive Board must obtain the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board is\nrequired to report to the Supervisory Board on the conclusion, amendment or termination of im-\nportant agreements that do not require approval under the Articles of Association or the Executive\nBoard’s Rules of Procedure. The Executive Board is also required to notify the Supervisory Board of\nall material events, even those that do not require the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board worked closely together\nthroughout 2020 for the benefit of the Company. The shared objective is to secure AIXTRON’s lea-\nding market positions in the long term in order to benefit from growing end markets.\n27\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nNo committees have been set up by AIXTRON SE’s Executive Board.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has established four committees, an Audit Committee,\na Nomination Committee, a Capital Market Committee and a Remuneration Committee (since\nSeptember 2019). The Supervisory Board is authorized to establish additional committees from\namong its members.\nThe Audit Committee consists of a Chairwoman and two other members. As an independent\nmember, the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Anna Gersbacher, has expertise in\nthe areas of accounting and auditing (§ 107 para. 4, § 100 para. 5 AktG) and special knowledge\nand experience in the application of internal control procedures. The members are also familiar\nin their entirety with the sector in which AIXTRON is represented, which is partially due to their\nmany years of experience. The Audit Committee deals in particular with the monitoring of ac-\ncounting, the accounting process, corporate governance & compliance, the effectiveness of the\ninternal control system, the risk management system, the internal audit system and the audit\nof the financial statements. Furthermore, the Audit Committee submits to the full Supervisory\nBoard a reasoned recommendation for the appointment of the auditor. It monitors the necessary\nindependence of the auditor and the additional services provided by the auditor. Finally, it deals\nwith the issuing of the audit mandate to the auditor, the determination of auditing focal points\nand the fee agreement.\nThe committee chairwoman, Prof. Dr. Anna Gersbacher, reports regularly to the Supervisory Board\non the work of the Audit Committee.\nThe Nomination Committee, which consists of three members of the Supervisory Board, makes\nelection proposals to the full Supervisory Board in the event of new appointments to executive\nbodies and discusses issues relating to the replacement of members of the Supervisory Board.\nFor the purpose of evaluating, supporting and implementing projects with capital market rele-\nvance, a Capital Market Committee has existed since 2014, consisting of two members, the Chair-\nman of the Supervisory Board and another member elected from among the Supervisory Board\nmembers.\nIn addition, a Remuneration Committee was established, consisting of Chairman Kim Schindel-\nhauer and two other members of the Supervisory Board, which deals with the application of the\nnew remuneration system in accordance with the revised DCGK.\nFurther details on the work of the Executive Board, Supervisory Board and committees during\nfiscal year 2020 can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board, which is part of the Annual\nReport and can be downloaded from the AIXTRON website. Full details of the composition of the\ncommittees can be found in the section “Supervisory Board and its composition”.\n28\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nExecutive Board and its composition\nAccording to Article 8 of AIXTRON SE’s Articles of Association, the Executive Board consists of\ntwo or more people. The Supervisory Board determines the precise number of Executive Board\nmembers. It also decides whether there should be a Chairman and whether deputy members or\na Deputy Chairman should be appointed.\nAt the time of reporting, AIXTRON SE’s Executive Board is comprised of three members who jointly\nmanage the business as equal members of the Executive Board:\nExecutive Board\n(as of December 31, 2020)\nName Position Since End of Term\nDr. Felix Grawert President August 14, 2017 August 13, 2025\nDr. Bernd Schulte President April 1, 2002 March 31, 2021\nDr. Jochen Linck President October 1, 2020 September 30, 2023\nThe appointment of Executive Board member Dr. Bernd Schulte will regularly expire at the end of\nMarch 31, 2021. At his own request, Dr. Bernd Schulte is no longer available for further appoint-\nment. On December 21, 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Christian Danninger as a new\nmember of the Executive Board in the function of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) with effect from July\n1, 2021 or earlier. The appointment was made for three years.\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board appointed Executive Board member Dr. Felix Grawert as\nChairman of the Executive Board effective April 1, 2021.\nNotwithstanding the Executive Board’s overall legal responsibility and the obligation of the Execu-\ntive Board members to collaborate closely and in confidence with their colleagues, the assigned\nresponsibilities of the individual members of the Executive Board are as follows in accordance\nwith the currently valid business distribution plan as of October 1, 2020:\nWithin the AIXTRON GROUP, Executive Board member Dr. Grawert is responsible for Strategic\nPlanning, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Human Resources, Finance and Reporting.\nWithin the Group, Executive Board member Dr. Schulte is responsible for Research and Develop-\nment, Investor Relations & Communications, Corporate Governance, Environment, Social Affairs\nand Corporate Governance, Compliance & Risk Management, Legal Affairs, and until September\n31, 2020, Information Technology, Procurement, Quality Management, Manufacturing, Logistics\nand Facility Management. Following the resignation of Dr. Schulte, the areas not covered by Dr.\nLinck will initially be taken over by Dr. Grawert.\n29\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nSince October 1, 2020, Executive Board member Dr. Linck has been responsible within the Group\nfor Procurement, Product Cost Management, Manufacturing and Logistics, Quality Management,\nIT, Facility Management and - since February 1, 2021 - Research and Development.\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board has adopted Rules of Procedure\nwhich are regularly reviewed for their appropriateness and topicality. Among other things, they\ncontain a list of matters of fundamental or significant importance on which the Executive Board\nmust formally resolve. This concerns, for example, decisions on: the Company‘s strategies, busi-\nness plans and budgets; material changes to the Company and Group organization; the commen-\ncement or cessation of the Company‘s activities; the acquisition and sale of land or land rights;\nthe conclusion, amendment and termination of corporate or significant license agreements; the\naward of major external consulting and research contracts; fundamental issues relating to hu-\nman resources and personnel policy; determining the principles for representation in business\norganizations and associations; appointments to the management and supervisory bodies of\nsubsidiaries and associated companies; important publications and information to the public out-\nside the regular publicity; initiating lawsuits and legal disputes; providing collateral and assuming\nguarantees.\nThe Rules of Procedure for the Executive Board and the Articles of Association each contain a\ncatalog of significant transactions and measures that additionally require the prior approval of\nthe Supervisory Board. The transactions and measures requiring approval under the Articles of\nAssociation or the Rules of Procedure include, for example, decisions on the establishment or sale\nof business premises, the acquisition or sale of land, the commencement or discontinuation of\nbusiness activities or the granting or taking out of loans.\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure, meetings of the Executive Board take place at least\ntwice a month and when the well-being of the Company so requires. Meetings of the Executive\nBoard are convened and chaired by the Executive Board. Each member of the Executive Board can\narrange an additional meeting on a specific topic at any time. The Executive Board constitutes a\nquorum if all members have been invited and more than half of its members are present at the\ntime the resolution is adopted, whereby members of the Executive Board connected by telepho-\nne or video conference are deemed to be present. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Articles\nof Association or the Rules of Procedure, the Executive Board shall decide by a simple majority of\nthe votes cast. In the case of a Board of Management consisting of two members, the Chairman\nof the Supervisory Board had to be consulted and asked for mediation in the event of a tie.\nEach member of the Executive Board will disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board\nwithout delay and inform the other members of the Executive Board accordingly. Members of the\nExecutive Board may only take on secondary activities, in particular Supervisory Board mandates\noutside the Company, with the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n30\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nLong-term succession planning for the Executive Board and age limit for the\nExecutive Board\nAIXTRON is a global Company operating in a very dynamic and technologically demanding market\nenvironment. Therefore, it is of strategic importance for AIXTRON to have a competent Executive\nBoard and to appoint suitable candidates to the Executive Board. After the complete change of\ngeneration in the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board will also pursue a long-term succession\nplanning. As part of the succession planning, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board will\nalso discuss suitable internal candidates to be appointed to the Executive Board. The age limit for\nthe Executive Board is 65 years and is set out in the Executive Board‘s Rules of Procedure.\nSupervisory Board and its composition\nPursuant to Article 11 of AIXTRON SE’s Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board consists of\nfive members. The members of the Supervisory Board are generally appointed until the end of\nthe Annual General Meeting in which the shareholders represented ratify the approval of the\nSupervisory Board’s activities for the fourth fiscal year after the term of office begins, whereby\nthe fiscal year in which the appointment was made is not included.\nThe Supervisory Board elects a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman from among its members. The\nSupervisory Board Chairman or – if he is unable to do so – his Deputy convenes and conducts the\nSupervisory Board meetings.\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted Rules of Procedure. They govern the tasks, rights and obliga-\ntions of the Supervisory Board, the organization of meetings and resolutions and the formation\nof committees. The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board were last revised in fiscal year\n2020. In 2019, the wording of the transactions requiring approval in the Rules of Procedure was\nadapted to the wording of the Articles of Association. The Audit Committee has separate Rules of\nProcedure established by the Supervisory Board.\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board is generally available for discussions with investors but\nonly to the extent that such discussions take place within a reasonable framework and the topics\nfall within the sole competence of the Supervisory Board.\nIn order to enable gradual personnel changes in the Supervisory Board, the election periods were\nno longer set uniformly for the Board as a whole when the Supervisory Board was voted in at the\nAnnual General Meeting in May 2016, but instead with differing terms. The term of office of the\nSupervisory Board members therefore expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting up to the\nend of which the respective individual was elected.\nCurrently, the composition of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Articles of Association\nand as determined by the General Meeting is as follows:\n31\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nComposition of the Supervisory Board\n(as of December 31, 2020)\nName Position Since End of Term\nChairman of the\nSupervisory Board\nKim Schindelhauer1)2)3)4)5) 2002 AGM 2022\nChairman of the Remuneration\nCommittee\nChairwoman of the Audit\nProf. Dr. Anna Gersbacher1) Committee, independent 2019 AGM 2024\nfinancial expert\nProf. Dr. Andreas Biagosch1)4) 2013 AGM 2021\nProf. Dr. Petra Denk2)3) 2011 AGM 2021\nDeputy chairman of the\nFrits van Hout2)3) 2019 AGM 2024\nSupervisory Board\n1) Member of the Audit Committee\n2) Member of the Remuneration Committee\n3) Member of the Nomination Committee\n4) Member of the Capital Market Committee\n5) Former AIXTRON Executive Board member\nComposition of Committees\nAudit Committee Nomination Committee Capital Market Committee Remuneration Committee\nProf. Dr. Anna Gersbacher Kim Schindelhauer\nFrits van Hout Kim Schindelhauer\n(Chairwoman) (Chairman)\nKim Schindelhauer Prof. Dr. Petra Denk Prof. Dr. Andreas Biagosch Prof. Dr. Petra Denk\nProf. Dr. Andreas Biagosch Kim Schindelhauer Frits van Hout\nBoth Prof. Dr. Denk and Prof. Dr. Biagosch will apply for re-election to the Supervisory Board at the\n2021 Annual General Meeting.\nIndependence of Supervisory Board Members\nThe Supervisory Board shall include what it considers to be a sufficient number of independent\nmembers. A Supervisory Board member shall be deemed independent if he or she is independent\nof the Company and its Executive Board and independent of a controlling shareholder (Recom-\nmendation C.6 para. 2 DCGK 2020). Pursuant to Recommendation C.7 (1) Sentence 2 DCGK 2020, a\nSupervisory Board member shall be deemed independent if he or she has no personal or business\nrelationship with the Company or the Executive Board that could give rise to a material conflict of\ninterest that is not merely temporary. The Supervisory Board has set itself the goal that at least\nhalf of its members must be independent. Since all members of the Supervisory Board, which\nconsists exclusively of elected shareholder representatives, are to be regarded as independent\nthis objective is also met. The independent members of the Supervisory Board are not named\nseparately here, as the list would include the entire Supervisory Board (see table of Supervisory\nBoard members).\nWith Mr. Schindelhauer, the Supervisory Board includes one former member of the Executive\nBoard whose term of office as a member of the Executive Board, however, dates back more than\n32\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\ntwo years (refer also to C.7 DCGK 2020). In particular, the Supervisory Board thus includes no more\nthan two former members of the Executive Board (recommendation C.11 DCGK 2020).\nIn the run-up to the Supervisory Board meeting on December 11, 2020, the members of the\nSupervisory Board received the self-evaluation questionnaire prepared annually by the Chair-\nman of the Supervisory Board. After evaluation of the questionnaire, it was determined that the\nSupervisory Board performs its activities efficiently in accordance with recommendation D.13 of\nthe DCGK 2020.\nFurther mandates of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are listed in\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements in section 34 “Supervisory Board and Manage-\nment Board”.\nThe Company did not enter into or carry out any material transactions with any related parties in\nthe 2020 fiscal year.\nThe Audit Committee is chaired by an independent and knowledgeable member of the Supervi-\nsory Board in accordance with recommendation D.4 of the DCGK 2020. This is not the Chairman of\nthe Supervisory Board.\nLike the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board holds four regular meetings per calendar year.\nExtraordinary Supervisory Board meetings as well as meetings of the Nomination Committee and\nthe Capital Market Committee are convened as required.\nThe Executive Board reports in writing and orally on the individual agenda items and draft resolu-\ntions of the Supervisory Board meetings and answers the questions of the individual Supervisory\nBoard members. Between meetings, all members of the Supervisory Board receive detailed quar-\nterly reports from the Executive Board on the situation of the Company. In addition, the Chairman\nof the Supervisory Board or the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee are informed by the Execu-\ntive Board about important developments and upcoming important decisions in telephone calls\nand personal discussions.\nAs a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board and its committees are passed at the meetings.\nIn justified exceptional cases, Supervisory Board members may also participate in a meeting of\nthe Supervisory Board or a committee by telephone or video conference. The Supervisory Board\nand its committees shall each constitute a quorum if two thirds of its members participate in the\nadoption of the resolution (outside of meetings by means of a vote conducted in writing, by fax,\nby telephone or by e-mail or by a combination of these aforementioned communication media,\nprovided that no member of the Supervisory Board objects to this procedure). Resolutions require\na simple majority of the votes cast. In the event of a tie, the chairman of the meeting has the\ncasting vote.\nEach member of the Supervisory Board shall disclose to the Supervisory Board any conflicts of\ninterest, in particular those that may arise as a result of a consultancy or directorship function\nwith customers, suppliers, lenders or other third parties. Material and not only temporary conflicts\n33\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nof interest in the person of a member of the Supervisory Board result in that person having to\nresign from office.\nSelf-evaluation of the Supervisory Board\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal self-evaluation based on a ques-\ntionnaire, taking into account AIXTRON-specific topics. The results were discussed by the Super-\nvisory Board and confirmed that the cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the\nExecutive Board was characterized by a high degree of trust and openness and was always pro-\nfessional and constructive. The Supervisory Board and its committees were also considered to be\nadequately informed and efficient in their work. Hence there is no fundamental need for change.\nInformation on the equal representation of men and women as\nper § 76 para. 4 and § 111 para. 5 AktG\nPursuant to §§ 76 para. 4 and 111 para. 5 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervi-\nsory boards and Executive Boards of companies that are listed on the stock exchange or subject to\nco-determination must set target figures for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Boards,\nExecutive Boards and the two management levels below the Executive Board. The DCGK reflects\nthese regulations in principle 9 sentence 2 DCGK 2020 for the Executive Board and in recommen-\ndation C.1 sentence 2 DCGK 2020 for the Supervisory Board.\nAIXTRON aims to increase both the proportion of women and the internationality of its employees\nand managers. In doing so, the Company is primarily committed to the professional and social\nqualification of all employees. In particular, due to the continuing low proportion of women in\ntechnical courses of study, the availability of qualified female applicants is very limited.\nThe Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE had set the following target figures for the proportion\nof women to be reached by 31 December 2021:\nWomen’s quota as\nLevel Target per 31.12.2021 of 31.12.2020 Determined by\nSupervisory Board 16,7% 40% Supervisory Board\nExecutive Board 0% 0% Supervisory Board\nSince the initial determination of the target figures for achievement by December 31, 2021, the\nSupervisory Board of AIXTRON SE has been reduced from six to five members. The five-member\nSupervisory Board includes two women, bringing the proportion of female Supervisory Board\nmembers to 40%.\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE has set itself the goal of specifically promoting women in the\nCompany. In line with this, the Executive Board has now raised the targets for the proportion\n34\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nof women to 10% for the first level below the Executive Board and to 20% for the second level\nbelow the Executive Board. These targets are to be achieved by December 31, 2025.\nNew target per Former target per Women’s quota as\nLevel 31.12.2025 31.12.2021 of 31.12.2020 Determined by\n1. tier management 10% 3% 4% Executive Board\n2. tier management 20% 17% 17% Executive Board\nThe target figure for the Executive Board corresponded to the current status at the time of resolu-\ntion. The proportion of women at the first tier below the Executive Board was 4% as of December\n31, 2020 (applicable target as of December 31, 2020: 3%) and 17% at the second tier below the\nExecutive Board (applicable target as of December 31, 2020: 13%).\nThe Company has therefore achieved the targets set.\nDiversity concept for the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard; targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board\nand status of implementation\nExecutive Board\nAs provided for by the DCGK 2020, AIXTRON has addressed diversity objectives (“diversity”) in\ncorporate governance (recommendations B.1 and C.1).\nWhen proposing the appointment of new members to the Executive Board by the Nominating\nCommittee, the Supervisory Board takes into account their personal and professional suitability,\ninternational experience and leadership quality, the age limit set for members of the Executive\nBoard, and diversity, including aspects such as age, gender, and educational and professional\nbackground. The Executive Board should consist of members with different, complementary com-\npetence profiles as well as a sufficient age mix and possess different personalities.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, members of the Executive Board should, as\nfar as possible, have different knowledge and experience as well as educational and professional\nbackgrounds, both individually and in their entirety as a team. International experience is an ad-\nvantage against the background of the Company‘s international orientation.\nIn its search for suitable candidates for vacant positions on the Executive Board, the Supervisory\nBoard took the diversity concept into account and, as part of this, also considered female candi-\ndates. The Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Linck and Dr. Danninger as members of the Executive\nBoard in each case after weighing up the interests of the Company. Based on the structure now\nin place, no changes in the composition are planned, so the target for the proportion of women\non the Board of Management valid until December 31, 2021 has consequently been set at 0%\npercent.\n35\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nSupervisory Board\nThe Supervisory Board has set the target for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board at\n16.7% and the deadline for achieving this target on December 31, 2021. With Prof. Dr. Petra Denk\nand Prof. Dr. Anna Gersbacher, two of the five members of the Supervisory Board are women\ncurrently (40%).\nThe targets for the compositions of the Supervisory Board are shown in detail below:\n• When proposing candidates for election to the Supervisory Board, the Nomination\nCommittee ensures that the Supervisory Board always includes members who, individually\nand collectively as a team, have the knowledge, skills and professional experience required\nto properly perform their duties. Furthermore, the members should be independent. In this\nway, the nomination committee contributes to increasing the efficiency and transparency\nof the selection process. As a general rule, Supervisory Boards should be elected for the\nlongest period of time permitted by the statutes.\n• AIXTRON is strongly export-oriented. Experience in AIXTRON’s specific global electronics and\nsemiconductor markets is therefore a great advantage.\n• As a general rule, an age limit of 70 years should be appropriate for Supervisory Board\nmembers upon retirement. New Supervisory Board members should be available to the\nCompany for at least two election periods.\n• It is desirable that the individual members of the supervisory board have the most diverse\neducation, qualifications, expertise and international experience possible in order to have\nthe knowledge, skills and professional experience necessary to properly perform their\nduties. Company- and product-oriented coverage with an understanding of the business\nmodel, the industry-specific features and the processes in the various corporate areas of\nbusiness administration, accounting, auditing, corporate development, capital market,\ntechnology, equipment business, markets/distribution, semiconductor market etc. are\nadvantageous.\n• It is in the best interests of the Company to utilize the potential of well-trained and\nmotivated employees of different nationalities and genders. The Supervisory Board\nconsiders appropriate participation of women on the Supervisory Board to be very\nimportant, which is reflected in the current proportion of women on the Supervisory Board\nof 40%.\n• In its opinion, the Supervisory Board should have a sufficient number of independent\nmembers, whereby a member of the Supervisory Board shall not be considered\nindependent in particular if he or she has a business or personal relationship with the\nCompany, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder or a Company affiliated with the\nlatter that could give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n• At least half of the Supervisory Board shall consist of independent members.\n• No more than two former members of the Executive Board shall be members of the\n36\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nSupervisory Board.\n• The members of the Supervisory Board shall not exercise directorships or similar positions\nor advisory tasks for important competitors of the enterprise.\n• The Supervisory Board must have at least one member who is independent in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the DCGK 2020 and who has expertise in the areas of\naccounting, internal control procedures and auditing. This member of the Supervisory Board\nis then also a member of the Audit Committee.\n• Due to the increased demands on the professionalization of the Supervisory Board and in\norder to simultaneously ensure the greatest possible efficiency of the Supervisory Board’s\nactivities as in previous years, new Supervisory Board members should not hold more\nthan five mandates in other listed companies or other companies if they have comparable\nrequirements.\nIn addition to the goals set for its composition, the Supervisory Board has also drawn up a compe-\ntence profile for the entire Board. In view of AIXTRON’s business activities and the markets addres-\nsed by the Company, the Supervisory Board shall have competencies in the areas of technology,\nfinance/accounting, capital markets, strategy and corporate governance. Furthermore, a grown\nnetwork of contacts and many years of experience in the respective disciplines are advantageous.\nThe requirement for diversity within the Supervisory Board (recommendation C.1 sentence 2 DCGK\n2020) is taken into account, among other things, as a result of the diverse competencies of the\nindividual Supervisory Board members (with regard to areas such as finance, capital markets,\nM&A, and technology and markets).\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE are convinced that the composition\nof the Supervisory Board fully complies with its own objectives and competence profile as well\nas with the requirement of the DCGK for appropriate diversity and an appropriate number of in-\ndependent Supervisory Board members.\nInformation on the remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory\nBoard and on the remuneration system of the Executive Board\nDetailed information on the structure and amount of remuneration paid to the individual Execu-\ntive Board members in accordance with principle 25 DCGK 2020 and on the remuneration of the\nmembers of the Supervisory Board as well as an exact list of the outstanding Board stock options\ncan be found in the remuneration report as part of the Group’s consolidated management report.\nThe new remuneration system approved by the 2020 Annual General Meeting pursuant to §\n87a (1) and (2) sentence 1 AktG has been made publicly available on the Company‘s website at\nhttps://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/remuneration-policy. In accordan-\nce with the transitional provisions of § 26j (1) and (2) of the Introductory Act to the Stock Corpo-\n37\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nration Act (EGAktG), there is currently no remuneration report on the last financial year prepared\nin accordance with § 162 AktG, nor is there a resolution on remuneration by the Annual General\nMeeting in accordance with § 113 (3) AktG. In accordance with §§ 289a (2), 285 No. 9 of the Ger-\nman Commercial Code (HGB) in the version applicable pursuant to Art. 83 (1) of the Introductory\nAct to the German Commercial Code (EGHGB), the compensation of the members of the Executive\nBoard is described in the remuneration report in accordance with the provisions of the German\nCommercial Code as part of the Group management report.\nShareholders and Annual General Meeting\nIn the 2020 fiscal year, the Annual General Meeting was held in completely virtual form for the\nfirst time on May 20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated contact restrictions.\nThe invitation to the Annual General Meeting was published in due time in the German Federal\nGazette (Bundesanzeiger) in accordance with the statutory requirements and contained, among\nother things, the agenda with the proposed resolutions of the administration or the Supervisory\nBoard as well as the conditions for attending the Annual General Meeting and exercising voting\nrights. All reports and documents required by law were available on the AIXTRON website from\nthe time the General Meeting was convened. Immediately after the Annual General Meeting,\nAIXTRON published the attendance and voting results in a press release and on its website.\nFive out of six agenda items were put to the vote. All resolutions were passed with clear majori-\nties, with almost 57% of AIXTRON‘s share capital represented at the AGM.\nTransparency\nTo ensure maximum transparency, AIXTRON regularly and promptly informs interested parties\nsuch as customers, suppliers, shareholders, shareholder associations, potential investors, finan-\ncial analysts and the media of the Group’s business developments. The internet is the primary\ncommunication channel used for this purpose.\nReports on the business situation and financial results of AIXTRON SE and the AIXTRON Group are\nmade available in German and/or English, in the form of:\n• The Annual Report with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group Management\nReport and the Supervisory Board Report, including also the Financial Statements and the\nManagement Report of AIXTRON SE\n• The Non-financial Group Report (Sustainability Report)\n• Interim financial reports\n• Quarterly conference calls for the press and analysts and respective transcripts\n• Company presentations\n38\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n• Publication of insider information, as well as Company and press statements.\nThe date of the Annual General Meeting or the publication dates of the financial reports are\nsummarized in the Company’s financial calendar on the AIXTRON website in the section Inves-\ntors/events and dates. This calendar, as well as the reports, speech manuscripts, presentations,\nwebcasts, and announcements listed above, can be freely viewed on the AIXTRON website for a\ncertain period of time.\nAccounting and Audit of the Annual Financial Statements\nThe quarterly reports as of March 31, June 30, September 30, and the consolidated financial state-\nments as of December 31, 2020 were prepared in accordance with the International Financial\nReporting Standards - IFRS. The separate financial statements of AIXTRON SE for fiscal year 2020\nwere prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\nThe consolidated financial statements and the individual financial statements of AIXTRON SE were\naudited by the auditor and approved by the Supervisory Board. It was agreed with the auditors\nthat the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairman of the Audit Committee would be\ninformed immediately of any reasons for exclusion or exemption or any inaccuracies in the De-\nclaration of Conformity that arise during the audit. No such duties to inform were triggered in the\nyear under review.\nRemuneration Report\nAIXTRON SE has introduced a new Executive Board remuneration system (“new remuneration\nsystem”), which was approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020. This system\nis applicable to all contracts concluded with members of the Company’s Executive Board sub-\nsequent to May 20, 2020. In parallel to the new remuneration system, the former remuneration\nsystem approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2018 continues to apply to existing\ncontracts with members of the Executive Board (“former remuneration system”). This means that\ntwo remuneration systems were applied in the 2020 year under report. The following remunera-\ntion report sets out the principles underlying these remuneration systems for the Executive and\nSupervisory Boards of AIXTRON SE as applicable in the 2020 year under report and explains the\nstructure and amount of remuneration. The description of the former remuneration system has\nbeen limited to those elements which were applied in fiscal year 2020. Furthermore, the remune-\nration report also includes individualized disclosures on the remuneration of individual members\nof the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The remuneration report also includes disclosures made\nin accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and of International\n39\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as well as select disclosures already provided on a volunta-\nrily basis in accordance with the material requirements of the German Act on the Transposition\nof the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechte-\nrichtlinie, ARUG II).\nPrinciples of former remuneration system\n(Application to former Executive Board contracts)\nThe former remuneration system for members of the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE is aligned\nnot only with the commercial and financial situation and future prospects of the Company and the\ncustomary level and structure of Executive Board remuneration at comparable companies but also\nwith the remuneration structure in place in other areas of the Company. In addition, the respon-\nsibilities, experience and contribution of each individual Executive Board member, and the long-\nterm commitment to the Company, are taken into account when calculating the remuneration.\nExecutive Board remuneration consists of three components: fixed remuneration (including be-\nnefits in kind and payments into a private pension insurance), variable remuneration, and share-\nbased remuneration.\nScope of application in 2020\nIn fiscal year 2020, the former remuneration system was applied to former Executive Board con-\ntracts as follows:\n• Dr. Bernd Schulte: from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020\n• Dr. Felix Grawert: from January 1, 2020 to August 13, 2020.\nFixed remuneration in former remuneration system\nThe Executive Board employment contracts stipulate an annual income for the fixed remuneration\ncomponent. The fixed remuneration component is non-performance-related and is paid out as\na monthly salary. Additional payments in kind are provided, mainly in the form of Company car\nusage and payments for individual private pension insurance.\nVariable remuneration in former remuneration system\nThe limited variable remuneration scheme for the collective Executive Board (profit-sharing) is\nbased on consolidated net income for the year and is paid from an “accrued internal bonus pool”,\ndefined as up to 10% of the consolidated net income for the year, but not to exceed EUR 6.5 mil-\nlion in total. The consolidated net income for the year is obtained from the Company’s consolida-\nted financial statements (IFRS) certified by the auditor.\n40\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe variable remuneration per member of the Executive Board – paid out of the above mentioned\n“accrued internal bonus pool” – amounts to 2.5% of the Group’s net income per board member\nand is paid half in cash and half in stocks. The portion of the variable bonus that is payable in\nstocks is converted into whole numbers of stocks of the Company and deferred to the third bank\nworking day after the Annual General Meeting in the third fiscal year after being granted to the\nBoard members. The number of stocks to be granted for the part of the variable bonus payable in\nstocks is determined by reference to the closing price of the Company’s stock on the third banking\nday after the Annual General Meeting to which the annual and consolidated financial statements\nare presented for the fiscal year for which the bonus is granted. The stocks are serviced from\ntreasury stocks. During the multiyear qualifying period, the Executive Board members participate\nin both positive and negative developments in the stock price. This means the variable remune-\nration structure is clearly aligned to sustainable Company performance.\nShare-based remuneration in former remuneration system\nIn addition, as a variable component with a long-term incentive effect and risk character, Execu-\ntive Board members may receive share-based remuneration in the form of option rights granted\nunder AIXTRON’s stock option plans or of AIXTRON stocks. Under a historic contract, Dr. Grawert\nthus receives stocks in the Company worth EUR 50,000 per fiscal year. The number of shares is\ndetermined on the basis of the closing price of the Company’s share on the third banking day\nafter the Annual General Meeting to which the annual and consolidated financial statements are\npresented for the corresponding fiscal year. No stock options were granted in fiscal year 2020.\nDetails of the outstanding Executive Board options and of their allocation to individual stock\noption plans and tranches can be found below in the section “Remuneration of Executive Board\nmembers in fiscal year 2020”.\nOther aspects of former remuneration system\nThe former remuneration system does not provide any individual pension commitments for the\ncurrent Executive Board members. In view of this, no provisions for pensions have been stated.\nExecutive Board members also do not receive any loans from the Company.\nPrinciples of new remuneration system\n(Application to new Executive Board contracts)\nThe new remuneration system was introduced at AIXTRON SE following the approval provided\nby the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020. It takes into account selected requirements\nof the German Act on the Transposition of the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur\nUmsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechterichtlinie, (ARUG II)) and is aligned to the recommen-\ndations made in the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code taking effect on\nMarch 20, 2020 (DCGK 2020).\nScope of application in 2020\nThe new remuneration system was applied to new Executive Board employment contracts in\n41\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nfiscal year 2020 as follows:\n• Dr. Felix Grawert: from August 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020\n• Dr. Jochen Linck: from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.\nPrinciples of new remuneration system\nExecutive Board remuneration at AIXTRON SE is structured in a way that creates incentives for\nthe sustainable, long-term development of the Company and for the long-term commitment of\nExecutive Board members.\nThe Supervisory Board sets the specific remuneration for each Executive Board member on the\nbasis of the remuneration system. To the extent legally permissible, the Supervisory Board seeks\nto offer Executive Board members remuneration that is both in line with the market and com-\npetitive, also in order to be able to recruit outstanding individuals to AIXTRON SE and gain their\nlong-term commitment.\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board sets target total remuneration for\neach individual Executive Board member for the forthcoming fiscal year. This consists of three\ncomponents:\n• fixed remuneration,\n• short-term performance-related variable remuneration (short-term incentive, STI), and\n• long-term performance-related variable remuneration (long-term incentive, LTI).\nRemuneration structure\n3 years\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\n(reference period)\n1 year\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI)\n(fiscal year)\nFixed remuneration Fixed\nFixed remuneration consists of fixed, non-performance-related base remuneration, which is\npaid out as a monthly salary. Other components of fixed remuneration include fringe benefits,\nsuch as the provision of a Company car, allowances for individual private pensions, and the as-\n42\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nsumption of costs for other insurance policies.\nVariable remuneration is tied to the performance of the AIXTRON Group and consists of short-\nterm variable remuneration (STI) and long-term variable remuneration (LTI). The amount of both\ncomponents depends on the achievement of financial and non-financial performance indicators.\nShort-term performance-related variable remuneration (STI) in new remuneration system\nThe short-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the short-term incentive\n(STI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group in the given fiscal year and is paid out\nin full in cash.\nThe STI is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for the year, the market posi-\ntion of the AIXTRON Group, as well as financial and operational targets. In this regard, the relative\nweighting amounts to 70% for consolidated net income for the year, 15% for market position, and\n15% for financial and operational targets.\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI)\nTarget Setting Calculation\nTarget Value (amount) Target\nachievement\nTargets (key figures)\nFiscal year Amount (cash)\nPayment\nThe targets are set prior to the start of a fiscal year: The Supervisory Board establishes the STI’s\ntarget value and the targets based on the aforementioned indicators. In the event of 100% target\nachievement, the target STI varies from 1.1% to 1.75% of the consolidated net income for the year\npursuant to the budget approved by the Supervisory Board for the fiscal year.\nSTI target achievement is determined after the expiry of the fiscal year. This is capped at a ma-\nximum of 250% target achievement. No STI is paid if the consolidated net income for the year is\nnegative, i.e. in years in which the Company posts a loss. STI is paid out in cash after the Super-\nvisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements.\nLong-term performance-related variable remuneration (LTI) in new remuneration system\nThe amount of long-term performance-related remuneration, also referred to as the long-term\nincentive (LTI), is geared to the performance of the AIXTRON Group over a 3-year reference\nperiod and is granted entirely in AIXTRON shares. Executive Board members may first dispose\nof these shares following a four-year holding period calculated from the start of the reference\nperiod.\n43\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nBefore the start of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board determines the long-term targets for\neach Executive Board member for the forthcoming reference period. Each Executive Board mem-\nber receives forfeitable stock awards in the amount of the target LTI, which varies from 1.4%\nto 2.25% of the consolidated net income for the year pursuant to the budget adopted by the\nSupervisory Board for the fiscal year. The number of forfeitable stock awards is calculated based\non the average of the closing prices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter of the\nprevious year. If consolidated net income for the year is budgeted to be zero or negative, and if a\nreturn to profitability is expected during the reference period, the Supervisory Board may within\nreasonable limits specify a LTI value for the fiscal year.\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI)\nTarget Setting Calculation\nTarget Value (amount) Target\nachievement\nTargets (key figures)\nReference period\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nRestriction period\nAIXTRON\nForfeitable stock awards Vested stock awards\nshares\nConversion Transfer\nLTI target achievement is determined using the indicators consolidated net income for the year\nand total shareholder return (TSR), as well as sustainability targets. In this regard, the relative\nweighting amounts to 50% for consolidated net income for the year, 40% for TSR, and 10% for\nsustainability targets.\nFor the first LTI key figure, the consolidated net income for the year, before the start of each\nfiscal year the Supervisory Board sets a target value that the aggregate consolidated net incomes\nfor must achieve during the reference period. After the reference period ends, the ratio of the\nactual value to the target value is calculated. If the two values are identical, target achievement\namounts to 100%. Target achievement is capped at a maximum of 250%. If the ratio is zero or\nnegative, target achievement amounts to 0%. A linear interpolation takes place between the\nvalues of 0% and 250%.\nThe second LTI key figure, the TSR, denotes the total shareholder return over the reference peri-\nod and is calculated as the ratio of the change in the stock price, plus paid dividends, at the end\nof the reference period to the value at the start of the reference period. The TSR for AIXTRON stock\nis determined by the weighted TSR for a comparative group, which consists of the shares of six\nsemiconductor equipment manufacturers – Veeco Instruments, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron,\nLam Research, ASML, and ASMI – and is weighted in proportion to their market capitalization.\n44\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nChanges in the share prices are determined by reference to the difference between the average\nvalues of the closing prices on all stock market trading days in the final quarter before the start\nof the reference period and in the final quarter of the reference period. After the reference period\nends, the ratio of the development in the TSR for AIXTRON shares to the development in the TSR\nfor the comparative group is calculated. Target achievement is capped at a maximum of 250%\nand amounts to 0% if the ratio is less than 50%. A linear interpolation takes place between\nthese values. If during the period under consideration the enterprises in the comparative group\nexperience extraordinary changes (such as mergers, changes in business activities, etc.), the\nSupervisory Board may take this appropriately into consideration with regard to the composition\nof the comparative group. In such case, the Supervisory Board will report on this in the annual\nremuneration report.\nThe third LTI key figure is calculated by reference to sustainability targets set by the Supervi-\nsory Board at the start of each reference period. These targets refer to the areas of environment,\nsocial affairs, and good corporate governance. Target achievement corresponds to the ratio of\nthe actual values to the target values and is capped at 250%. Before the start of each fiscal year,\nthe Supervisory Board sets two to three sustainability targets that are to be achieved by the end\nof the reference period. The sustainability targets that the Supervisory Board may choose from\nbefore the start of a fiscal year when setting targets for the respective Executive Board member\ninclude, among others: efficient use of energy and raw materials, reduction of emissions, emp-\nloyee satisfaction and development, customer satisfaction, innovation achievements, successor\nplanning, and compliance.\nAfter the expiry of the three-year reference period, the degree of LTI target achievement is deter-\nmined by the Supervisory Board. Depending on the degree of target achievement, the forfeitable\nstock awards are then converted into vested stock awards or otherwise lapse. The maximum\nnumber of vested stock awards that may be granted in connection with LTI is capped at 250% of\nthe number of forfeitable stock awards granted at the start of the reference period.\nFollowing expiry of the four-year restriction period, the shares are transferred to the Executive\nBoard member, with due compliance with the maximum remuneration limits set out below. The\nExecutive Board member is not entitled to receive dividends during the restriction period.\nRemuneration limits in new remuneration system\nThe remuneration system is intended to provide appropriate rewards for successful Executive\nBoard work and to ensure that the Executive Board and shareholders all benefit from the Compa-\nny’s positive development.\n45\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAt the same time, to prevent the taking of inappropriate risks and ensure an appropriate relation\nto the situation of AIXTRON SE, Executive Board remuneration is limited by setting maximum\nremuneration and a remuneration cap.\nMaximum remuneration (expenditure cap), i.e. the total remuneration owed to the Executive\nBoard for a fiscal year, may not exceed EUR 6.5 million in the case of two Executive Board mem-\nbers or EUR 10.0 million in the case of three or more Executive Board members. This represents\nthe expenditure cap, i.e. the maximum expense for the Company.\nThere is also a remuneration cap (allocation cap) for the aggregate of fixed remuneration, STI,\nand LTI. The actual allocation for each Executive Board member for a fiscal year is capped at four\ntimes the Executive Board member’s target total remuneration. This is the allocation cap. If the\nremuneration cap is exceeded, a portion of the vested stock awards previously awarded is forfei-\nted to ensure compliance.\nFixed remuneration will generally account for 20% to 40% of target total remuneration, while\nvariable remuneration will make up 60% to 80%. Long-term remuneration will account for a\ngreater share of remuneration in order to provide incentives for long-term and sustainable ac-\ntions. No additional remuneration is paid for group-internal mandates, such as at subsidiaries.\nFurther provisions governing new remuneration system\nTo ensure that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of shareholders, the\nCompany has a stockholding policy. Following a four-year build-up phase, each Executive Board\nmember is obliged to hold AIXTRON stock worth 100% of their base remuneration on a permanent\nbasis throughout their term of office. The value of vested stock awards is set off against the re-\nspective target shareholding value. Executive Board members may sell shares only if they exceed\nthe respective target value.\nFurthermore, a sanctioning mechanism, i.e. claw-back provision, applies for breaches of duty\nor compliance. Based on this mechanism, in the event of such breaches the Supervisory Board\nmay reduce variable remuneration components not yet paid out, allow stock awards to lapse,\nor even claw these back. These possibilities may be exercised even when the Executive Board\nmember is no longer in office and is no longer employed by the Company.\nIn justified exceptional circumstances, such as severe economic crises, the effects of which render\nthe original Company targets invalid, the Supervisory Board may resolve a temporary divergence\nfrom the remuneration system if such divergence is in the interests of AIXTRON SE. As a general\nrule, the targets and target values do not change during the periods relevant for the respective\ntarget achievement, even if developments in the overall market are unfavorable.\nA detailed description of the new Executive Board remuneration system adopted by\nthe Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020 can be found on AIXTRON’s website at\nhttps://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/remuneration-policy.\n46\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nComparison of remuneration in new remuneration system\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the appropriateness of the various components of remuneration\non an annual basis. The remuneration system is presented to the Annual General Meeting for\napproval in the event of any material changes to the system and at least every four years.\nFor the purposes of external comparison, the Supervisory Board refers to remuneration data\nat the semiconductor equipment manufacturers Veeco Instruments, Applied Materials, Lam Re-\nsearch, ASML, and ASMI, as well as to those companies listed in the TecDAX that have market\ncapitalizations between 50% and 200% of that at AIXTRON SE.\nFor the internal comparison, the Supervisory Board defines the senior management level as the\nten senior managers whose remuneration is not tied to collective bargaining agreements and\nwho have the greatest managerial responsibility and decision-making powers.\nReporting in new remuneration system\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board prepare a remuneration report each year in ac-\ncordance with statutory provisions. The remuneration report for fiscal year 2020 already includes\nselect disclosures that are provided on a voluntary basis in accordance with the material re-\nquirements of the German Act on the Transposition of the Second Shareholder Rights Directive\n(ARUG II). A remuneration report consistent with the requirements of stock corporation law pur-\nsuant to § 162 AktG as amended by ARUG II will be published for the first time for fiscal year 2021.\nIn this, the Supervisory Board will explain which performance criteria were applied and how the\namounts of the respective variable remuneration components are calculated.\nRemuneration reports for previous fiscal years each contain an outlook on application of the\nremuneration system in the respective current fiscal year. The outlook provides advance informa-\ntion about the selection of financial performance criteria. By contrast, non-financial performance\ncriteria and the specific targets set for financial indicators are only explained once the periods\nrelevant for STI and/or LTI have expired. This avoids the premature disclosure of any strategic\nprojects with a bearing on competition.\nArrangements upon contract termination\nShould a contract with an Executive Board member be terminated, then the outstanding variable\nremuneration components attributable to the time through to termination of the contract will be\npaid out in accordance with the originally agreed targets and comparison parameters and with\nthe due dates or holding periods specified in the contract. If an Executive Board contract ends\nduring a fiscal year, STI and LTI are granted on a prorated basis relative to the length of service in\nthis fiscal year.\nThe foregoing does not apply to cases in which the employment contract is terminated without\nnotice for cause inherent in the Executive Board member for which he or she is responsible. In\nsuch case, variable remuneration will not be paid for the year in which termination becomes\neffective.\n47\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nIn the case of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate by reason of revocation\nof the appointment, the Executive Board member will be paid a severance equal to the remune-\nration expected to be owed by the Company for the remaining term of the employment contract,\nbut not more than two years of remuneration (severance cap).\nWhen agreeing employment contracts with Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board\nmay stipulate that, in the event of the contract being terminated due to a change-of-control\nevent, severance will be paid in the aforementioned maximum amount. A change-of-control\nevent in the foregoing sense exists where a third party, or a group of third parties who combine\ntheir shareholding by contract in order to act as a single third party, directly or indirectly holds\nmore than 50% of the Company’s share capital.\nNo benefits in excess of this severance payment are permitted.\nIn the event of premature termination of the Executive Board mandate based on mutual agree-\nment to end the employment contract, the total value of benefits pledged by the Company to\nthe Executive Board member in connection with such agreement may not exceed the amount\nof remuneration expected to be owed by the Company for the original remaining term of the\nemployment contract and may not exceed a maximum of two annual remuneration packages.\nRemuneration of Executive Board members in fiscal year 2020\nExecutive Board remuneration\nThe following section describes the specific application of the remuneration system for members\nof the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE in fiscal year 2020. It includes details and background infor-\nmation about the total remuneration of the Executive Board, the setting and achievement of tar-\ngets for variable remuneration, and individualized disclosures on the remuneration of individual\nExecutive Board members for fiscal year 2020.\nTotal remuneration for fiscal year 2020\nTotal Executive Board remuneration for fiscal year amounted to EUR 2,956,429 (2019: EUR 2,459,339;\n2018: EUR 3,133,032). The non-performance-related fixed remuneration of the Executive Board for\nfiscal year 2020, comprising base remuneration, allowances for pension schemes, and benefits in\nkind, amounted to a total of EUR 911,530 (2019: EUR 785,469; 2018: EUR 789,932).\n48\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nBase remuneration for fiscal year 2020\nBase remuneration comprised the following amounts in fiscal year 2020:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 343,000\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: EUR 390,000\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 75,000 (October 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020)\nPension allowances for fiscal year 2020\nThe Executive Board members in office in the year under report do not have individual pension\ncommitments, as a result of which no provisions are stated for pensions. The Company rather\npays pension allowances to Executive Board members together with their salaries or makes con-\ntributions to an insurance contract with a pension fund.\nPension allowances form a constituent component of the non-performance-related fixed remu-\nneration of the Executive Board. They comprised the following amounts in fiscal year 2020:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 30,000\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: EUR 40,000\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 7,500 (October 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020)\nVariable remuneration for fiscal year 2020 under former remuneration system\nThe former remuneration system was applied in fiscal year 2020 to determine the variable re-\nmuneration payable to Dr. Felix Grawert from January 1, 2020 to August 13, 2020 and to Dr. Bernd\nSchulte from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Variable remuneration under the former re-\nmuneration system amounts to 2.5% of consolidated net income for the year per Executive Board\nmember and is paid out on a prorated basis, with half being paid in cash and half in shares. Under\nthe former remuneration system, this resulted in the following variable remuneration for fiscal\nyear 2020:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 267,000 in cash and EUR 267,000 to be granted in shares,\n• for Dr. Bernd Schulte: EUR 431,000 in cash and EUR 431,000 to be granted in shares.\n49\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nFurthermore, under his former contract Dr. Felix Grawert received AIXTRON shares worth\nEUR 50,000 per full fiscal year. On a prorated basis for the period from January 1, 2020 to August\n13, 2020, this resulted in the following claim:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 31,000 to be granted in shares.\nShort-term variable remuneration (STI) for fiscal year 2020 under new\nremuneration system\nIn fiscal year 2020, the new remuneration system was applied to determine the short-term va-\nriable remuneration for Dr. Felix Grawert from August 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and for Dr.\nJochen Linck from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.\nTarget dimension “consolidated net income for the year”\nIn December 2019, the Supervisory Board set a target value of EUR 19,000 for the consolidated net\nincome for 2020. The actual figure of EUR 34,470k results in a target achievement of 181%.\nTarget dimension “market position”\nFor the “market position” target position, the Supervisory Board set targets in respect of existing\nmarkets and of growth markets which the Company should penetrate for the first time. Strong\nsales performance in existing markets and success in growth markets resulted in a target achie-\nvement of 162%.\nTarget dimension “financial and operational targets”\nThe “financial and operational targets” target dimension was determined by setting performance\ncriteria in the OLED business and further strategic objectives. Target achievement in this area\namounted to 11% in the past fiscal year.\nBased on the target achievement in these three target dimensions, short-term variable remune-\nration (STI) under the new remuneration system can be calculated as follows for fiscal year 2020:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 193k in cash,\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 81k in cash.\nLong-term variable remuneration (LTI) for fiscal year 2020 under new\nremuneration system\nIn 2020, the new remuneration system was applied to the new contracts with Dr. Felix Grawert\nand Dr. Jochen Linck.\n50\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nTarget achievement for the 2020 LTI tranche is calculated by reference to the results achieved in\nthe period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. It is determined by the following perfor-\nmance criteria:\n• Consolidated net income for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (50% share)\n• Change in total shareholder return (TSR) from Q4 / 2019 to Q4 / 2022 (40% share)\n• Sustainability (10% share), measured in terms of energy consumption in kWh normed to\nthe most important drivers of consumption and employee training measured in terms of\nthe number of lessons.\nThe share price of AIXTRON SE relevant for the TSR target remuneration for 2020 amounts to\nEUR 8.682. This corresponds to the average of XETRA closing prices on all stock market trading\ndays in the 4th quarter of 2019. The degree of achievement for the performance criteria will be\ndetermined by the Supervisory Board upon the expiry of fiscal year 2022. Depending on the target\nachievement, the forfeitable stock awards will then be converted into vested stock awards. The\nstock awards will be transferred to the Executive Board after a restriction period of at least four\nyears which, for fiscal year 2020, will expire at the earliest on December 31, 2024.\nFor the long-term variable remuneration (LTI) for 2020, the Supervisory Board stipulated the va-\nlues of target LTI as follows:\n• for Dr. Felix Grawert: EUR 163k in forfeitable stock awards for the period from August 14,\n2020 to December 31, 2020\n• for Dr. Jochen Linck: EUR 66k in forfeitable stock awards for the period from October 1, 2020\nto December 31, 2020.\nVariances from new remuneration system\nThere were no variances and no adjustments to the comparative group of companies in 2020\ncompared with the resolution adopted by the AGM in respect of the remuneration system in May\n2020.\nBenefits granted and payments made in fiscal year 2020\nThe tables below show the values of the benefits granted to the respective Executive Board\nmembers in office in fiscal year 2020 pursuant to DCGK as well as the payments actually made to\nthe respective Executive Board members in fiscal year 2020 (“allocation” column).

The Executive Board\nis responsible for managing the Company at its own responsibility while being advised and mo-\nnitored by the Supervisory Board. In 2020, there were the following personnel changes in the\nCompany’s management and supervisory bodies:\nIn its meeting on May 8, 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Jochen Linck as Executive\nBoard member and Chief Operating Officer (COO) as of October 1, 2020. Executive Board member\nDr. Bernd Schulte will retire at his own request when his contract expires on March 31, 2021. Furt-\nhermore, the Supervisory Board renewed Dr. Felix Grawert‘s contract for five years and appointed\nhim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with effect from April 1, 2021. Finally, it was resolved to expand\nthe Executive Board by a Chief Financial Officer to three members. With the resolution to appoint\nDr. Christian Danninger to the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) no later than July 1, 2021,\nthe succession planning for the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE was successfully completed in\nDecember 2020.\nDetailed information on the composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, the\nallocation of responsibilities between them, the operating procedures of the Supervisory Board\ncommittees and the Company‘s diversity concept can be found in the Corporate Governance\nDeclaration according to § 289f HGB in conjunction with § 315d HGB, including the Declaration\nof Conformity according to § 161 AktG are part of the annual report and also available on the\nAIXTRON website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/rules-of-pro-\ncedure-supervisory-board.\nTechnology and Products\nAIXTRON’s product range includes customer-specific systems for the deposition of complex semi-\nconductor materials on a diverse range of different substrate sizes and materials.\nThe MOCVD process (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition) is used for the vapor phase\ndeposition of so-called compound semiconductor materials for the manufacture of power and\noptoelectronic components such as LEDs, lasers, other optoelectronic components or power elec-\ntronics.\nIn the field of optoelectronics, our customers use our systems to manufacture lasers for optical\ndata transmission and 3D sensor technology, whether for facial recognition and environment\ndetection in smartphones or for environment detection in robots, autonomous vehicles or other\napplications that require context recognition. Other applications include the production of special\nLEDs, such as Micro LEDs or red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY) for display applications, among\nothers, high-power LEDs for automotive lighting or UV LEDs for environmentally friendly disinfec-\ntion of water or air.\n61\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIn the area of power electronics, our systems are used, for example, for the production of gal-\nlium nitride (GaN) semiconductor devices for more compact and more powerful power supplies in\nconsumer electronics, for the efficient power supply of data centers and mobile communications\ninfrastructure. In addition, GaN is used on the other hand for wireless data transmission in mobile\ncommunications (especially in 5G). The GaN components required for this are also manufactured\non our systems. Finally, customers use our CVD systems to manufacture silicon carbide (SiC) com-\nponents which are used, for example, in electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure and in\ninverters for renewable energies (solar and wind).\nFor the fabrication of complex carbon nanostructures (carbon nanotubes and wires or graphene)\nthe PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) process is used.\nMoreover, AIXTRON’s subsidiary APEVA offers the OVPD (Organic Vapor Phase Deposition) pro-\ncess for the deposition of thin film materials for organic electronic applications, including organic\nlight emitting diodes (OLEDs).\nAIXTRON is constantly working on the improvement of existing technologies and products. In re-\ncent years, AIXTRON has introduced several new system generations and technologies, such as\nthe fully automated AIX G5+C for opto & power electronics applications or the AIX G5 WW C for the\nmass production of next-generation silicon carbide (SiC) epitaxial wafers for applications such as\npower electronics.\nBusiness Processes\nManufacturing and Procurement\nAIXTRON’s manufacturing activities focus on the assembly, testing and qualification of prototype\nand customer equipment. The Group purchases components and most of the assemblies required\nto manufacture the equipment from third-party suppliers and contractors. For strategic reasons,\nthere are typically several suppliers for each equipment component/assembly. However, for a\nfew key components with distinctive technical features, we are dependent on single suppliers.\nAssembly is performed at AIXTRON’s own production facility with the help of external ser-vice\nproviders and is managed and supervised by AIXTRON employees. Final testing is performed by\nAIXTRON employees.\nBoth of AIXTRON’s manufacturing facilities have process-oriented quality management systems\ncertified in accordance with ISO 9001:2015. In 2020, the certification of the quality management\nsystems of AIXTRON SE and AIXTRON Ltd. was confirmed without any deviation by external audi-\ntors.\n62\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEmployees\nAIXTRON’s success is very much determined by the achievements and motivation of its staff. The\nemployees are recruited based on professional and personal qualifications and experience. The\nGroup uses a variety of communication and recruitment channels to attract new, qualified emp-\nloyees. Apart from the direct advertising of job opportunities to attract new employees, AIXTRON\nregularly participates in job fairs and other career events, has local press coverage, and enjoys\nclose collaborative relationships with universities worldwide, including the RWTH Aachen Univer-\nsity and the University of Cambridge.\nLeadership culture in an organization also has a great impact on the success of the Company. The-\nrefore, AIXTRON promotes this culture through individual measures in which managers acquire\nknowledge and qualifications for leadership and team building.\nThe continuous training of our employees is both important and a matter of course. Our offering\nranges from individual training programs to acquire professional and personal skills, through a\nbroad range of in-house training courses, to personal coaching.\nIn 2020, the total number of employees in the Group increased by approximately 6%, from 688\nemployees at the end of 2019 (2018: 628) to 728 as of December 31, 2020. This is particularly due\nto new hires resulting from the positive business development. As in previous years, the majority\nof AIXTRON’s worldwide employees were based in Europe.\nCustomers and Geographic Regions\nAmong other areas of activity, AIXTRON’s semiconductor device customers are engaged in the\nmanufacturing of LEDs, lasers, high frequency devices, power electronics and other optoelectronic\ndevices. Some of these customers are vertically integrated device manufacturers who serve the\nentire value chain as far as the end consumer. Others are independent manufacturers of compo-\nnents or epitaxial wafers who deliver the products made on AIXTRON equipment to the next link\nin the value chain, namely, the electronic device manufacturers. The Company’s customers also\ninclude research centers and universities. Most of the world’s leading electronic device manufac-\nturers produce in Asia and consequently, the majority of AIXTRON sales continue to be delivered\ninto this region.\nSee also “Development of Revenues” in this report for a breakdown of revenues by region.\n63\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nObjectives and Strategies\nAs recognized technology leader in the field of complex deposition processes, AIXTRON currently\nfocuses on its core competencies in this area. With the development, manufacture, distribution\nand maintenance of thin film deposition systems for complex materials, AIXTRON addresses gro-\nwing future markets along a variety of end-user applications, such as consumer electronics, auto-\nmotive, telecommunications, and data transmission technology.\nTechnology Portfolio for Complex Material Deposition\nOLED: OVPD® / PVPD® Carbon – PECVD\nNANO: Innovation Pool\n64\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nscinortceleotpO\n/\nsDEL\nPower\nManagement\nLasers (VCSEL/EEL) GaN Power | GaN RF\n(e.g. 3D Sensing; Consumer (e.g. Wireless Charging; 5G,\nElectronics; Telecom/Datacom) Fast Charging, Power Supply)\nAIXTRON\nMOCVD Core Technology\nSpecialty LEDs\nSiC Power\n(e.g. Fine Pitch-, MiniLED-,\n(e.g. Electric Vehicles,\nMicro LED-Displays; Horticulture;\nCharging Stations, Infrastructure)\nPurification)\nIt is our objective to secure and further expand our market position in the addressed focus mar-\nkets in the long term through innovation and technology leadership, and to access adjacent\nmarkets by leveraging our core competencies. Increasing revenues and profitability are the focus\nof our strategic planning.\nAs in the previous year, AIXTRON‘s strategy is to target applications and markets that are attracti-\nve to AIXTRON in terms of size, growth, profitability and differentiation potential. These applica-\ntions, from the consumer electronics, IT infrastructure, and electromobility sectors, are subject to\nlargely independent growth dynamics. AIXTRON is not only dependent on a single segment but\nstrives to be robust against fluctuations in individual application markets across the entire range\nof applications. To this end, AIXTRON actively develops a broad technology portfolio through in-\nhouse or sponsored developments, through collaborations, or through targeted acquisitions. In\naddition, AIXTRON works closely with its customers to establish new technologies, which in turn\naddress new applications.\nAIXTRON focuses on markets where the use of AIXTRON technology allows for a clear differentia-\ntion from competitors and thus creates value added for customers. These include, among other\nthings, achieving high yields on the wafer by realizing high uniformity of the physical properties\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nof the deposited layers while simultaneously maintaining high throughput, low material and\nmaintenance costs. Markets with not enough potential for technical differentiation offer only low\nmargins.\nAIXTRON pursues a platform strategy with its AIX 2800G4 and AIX G5 and AIX G5 WW families\nof systems that are based on the planetary concept. With a high proportion of identical parts,\nthe systems can be configured according to customer’s specification. As outlined in the previous\nsection, this allows for a broad diversification and the addressing of numerous applications. In ad-\ndition to the AIX 2800G4 and AIX G5/G5WW system families, which address customers with high\nproduction volumes, AIXTRON sells a showerhead-based system series, to universities and niche\nmarkets. This allows AIXTRON to come into contact with emerging applications at an early stage\nand to understand customer needs in new markets.\nIn addition to the MOCVD product line, AIXTRON is developing a second product line for thin-film\ndeposition of organic materials, primarily for OLED displays. In 2018, AIXTRON SE signed a joint\nventure agreement with H&IRUJA Co. Ltd. of South Korea to invest in APEVA, the subsidiary re-\nsponsible for this application area. This was followed by the evaluation of APEVA‘s Organic Vapor\nPhase Deposition (OVPD) technology in collaboration with a major Asian OLED display manufactu-\nrer, with a Gen1-sized prototype and a larger Gen2 prototype deployed at that customer‘s facility.\nIn December 2020, APEVA received final acceptance of the Gen2 deposition system from the\ncustomer. This phase of the qualification project on the way to commercialization of APEVA‘s pro-\nprietary technology has been successfully completed. APEVA is currently in talks with customers\nabout a final qualification project for series production.\nIn addition, AIXTRON works on innovation projects for the development and industrialization of\nnew technologies for the production of graphene and carbon nanotubes based on the plasma-en-\nhanced CVD process (PECVD) as part of its innovation projects.\nManagement and Control System\nSince the various activities of the Group are largely integrated from an operational perspective,\nmanagement by means of performance indicators is carried out by the Executive Board of AIX-\nTRON SE at Group level. The Executive Board‘s development projections for the Group therefore\nalso apply to AIXTRON SE.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators\nThe most relevant performance indicators for the AIXTRON Group are order intake, revenues,\ngross margin and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to revenues (EBIT margin).\nThey are determined monthly in the AIXTRON reporting system and made available to manage-\nment in a comprehensive report. This enables the Executive Board to identify growth drivers at\nan early stage, to analyze developments during the year and take prompt countermeasures in the\nevent of any discernible deviations.\n65\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAIXTRON aims to achieve organic revenue growth, exchange rate effects are excluded when\nsetting revenue targets. Order intake reflects the investment behavior of our customers and thus\nserves as an early indicator for revenues. The period between receipt and delivery of an order for\nan MOCVD system is generally between six and eight months.\nGross margin, which expresses gross profit in relation to sales, provides information on the profi-\ntability and return on investment of AIXTRON’s operating business. The EBIT margin is used as an\nadditional important indicator for operational management and analysis of the earnings situation.\nAdditional Performance Indicators\nFree cash flow is no longer used as a key performance indicator at AIXTRON since fiscal year 2020,\nas the exact timing of large cash inflows from ongoing customer orders is difficult to forecast.\nNevertheless, management still attaches great importance to always generating sufficient cash\nflow to secure the Group’s financial resources in the medium and long term.\nWith the introduction of the new Executive Board remuneration system approved by the Annual\nGeneral Meeting on May 20, 2020, AIXTRON has defined sustainability targets for the Executive\nBoard and included corresponding non-financial performance indicators in Group management\nfor the first time. The following non-financial performance indicators have been defined for fiscal\nyears 2020 and 2021:\n• AIXTRON Group’s energy consumption\n(measured in kWh standardized to the most important consumption drivers)\n• the further training of AIXTRON Group’s employees\n(measured in hours of training completed)\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nIn addition to the R&D center at its headquarters in Herzogenrath, AIXTRON also operates a R&D\nlaboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. These in-house laboratories are equipped with AIX-\nTRON systems and are used to research and develop new equipment, materials and processes for\nthe production of semiconductor structures.\nFocus on Innovation\nAIXTRON’s R&D activities in 2020 included development programs for new products as well as\ncontinual improvement programs for AIXTRON’s existing products. Design-to-Cost-activities and\nstrategic approaches to the optimization of maintenance intervals have been implemented for\nnumerous R&D projects in order to continuously reduce costs e. g. through design improvements\nin externally provided components or through enhanced data analyses. Furthermore, AIXTRON is\nworking on customer-specific development projects and often does research within the frame-\nwork of publicly funded projects.\n66\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe Group’s R&D capability remains of important strategic significance, as it provides for a com-\npetitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the future business development. The-\nre-fore, AIXTRON is committed to investing specifically in research and development projects to\nretain or to expand the Company’s leading technology position in MOCVD equipment for applica-\ntions such as lasers, specialty LEDs and for the production of wide-band-gap materials for power\nelectronics. In addition, the Group is working on novel 2D nanostructures, which are seen as\nhaving great potential in research in line with international predictions (roadmaps).\nAPEVA is still evaluating the OVPD technology to achieve customer qualification for OLED display\nmanufacturing. In Q4 2020, the Gen2 OLED qualification project was completed together with\nengineers from a renowned display manufacturer. Further information on APEVA’s field of activity\ncan be found, among other things, in the opportunities report and the earnings development\nchapter of this report.\nFor the consistent technological enhancement of our product portfolio, we continued to invest\nmore than one in five euros (around 22%) of our revenues in research and development (R&D) in\nthe challenging year 2020, totaling EUR 58 million. At year-end 2020, 254 of AIXTRON Group’s total\n728 employees were engaged in research and development activities.\nTechnology protection through patents\nAIXTRON aims to secure its technology by patenting and protecting inventions, provided it is stra-\ntegically expedient for the Company to do so. As of December 31, 2020, the Group had 274 (thereof\nAIXTRON SE: 250) patent families available (December 31, 2019: 248 patent families). For 34 patent\nfamilies (AIXTRON SE: 22), patent protection was applied. Usually, patent protection for inventions\nis applied for in those markets relevant to AIXTRON, specifically in Europe, China, Japan, South Ko-\nrea, Taiwan and the United States. Patents are maintained and renewed annually and will expire\nbetween 2021 and 2040. AIXTRON continuously conducts a worldwide patent analysis in order to\nidentify and assess changes in the competitive environment at an early stage.\nResearch projects 2020\nAIXTRON is working on targeted research projects in areas that are considered to have growth\npotential in the future. While the „HEA2D“ research project was successfully completed in 2019,\nwork on the previous year‘s „UltimateGaN“ project continues. The research topic „MOCVD 4.0“ was\ncontinued with the project „MOCVD 4.2“ in the 2020 fiscal year.\nExamples of the Group‘s research work include the “MOCVD 4.2”, “MehrSi” and “SiTaSol” as well as\n“2D-EPL” and “AdaptAR” projects, on which AIXTRON worked intensively in 2020:\nOur research work on optimizing the production of compound semiconductors „MOCVD 4.2“,\nwhich began in 2019, is already delivering important results regarding the digitalization and op-\ntimization of industrial production. The collected and analyzed data provide input values for net-\nworked and automated machine concepts, intelligent software and improved process control.\nThe foundations developed in this context are to serve the introduction of new software-based\nservices. The aim is to successfully complete the project at the end of 2021.\n67\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAs part of the funded „MehrSi“ project, AIXTRON together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar\nEnergy Systems ISE, the Technical University of Ilmenau, the Philipps University of Marburg aims\nat an increase in efficiency of solar cells. A multi-junction solar cell grown directly on a silicon\nsubstrate, for example, achieved an efficiency of 25.9 percent for the first time. Thus, a central\nstage in the development of economic solutions for the industrial use of multi-junction solar cells\nfor power generation has been reached. This was achieved in the project thanks to the improved\nsystem technology developed by AIXTRON and the good cooperation with the project partners.\nIn the EU-funded „SiTaSol“ project, also addressing the topic of efficient energy generation with\nsolar cells, the aim is to make tandem solar cell technology accessible to the broad photovoltaic\nsector by means of cost-effective processes. AIXTRON has already been working on such III-V\nmulti-junction solar cells on silicon with several partners for many years. As part of the project,\nAIXTRON has built and tested a specially optimized epitaxy system in its own laboratory.\nAIXTRON is involved as one of eleven partners in the 2D Experimental Pilot Line „2D-EPL“ ini-\ntiative of the European Commission’s „Graphene Flagship“ project. The project was launched on\nOctober 1, 2020 and aims to create a suitable European environment for prototype production of\nelectronics, photonics, and sensors made from graphene and related materials. In order to bring\ngraphene and 2D materials to market and integrate them into semiconductor devices, AIXTRON\nwill develop a MOCVD reactor as part of this initiative. This growth technology can be used to\nproduce industrial grade 2D materials and associated heterostructures. Future application areas\nfor large scale integration of graphene and 2D materials could include logic, memory, photonics\nand sensor devices.\nAIXTRON is also working on innovative manufacturing processes as part of research projects. For\nexample, an augmented reality system with a digital twin as the data basis is being developed\nas part of the „AdaptAR“ research project. In the project, which is funded by the German Federal\nMinistry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the „Innovations for tomorrow’s production,\nservices and work“ program, every product in the factory is given a so-called digital twin or digital\nshadow. AIXTRON expects that a solution combining Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twin will\nmake it easier and more intelligent to create, use and maintain technical manuals than before.\nThe AR-supported technology can be linked to a remote service offering to increase efficiency.\n68\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nReport on Economic Position\nGlobal Economy\nAs a manufacturer of capital goods, AIXTRON may be affected by the development of the general\neconomic environment, as this could impact its own suppliers, manufacturing costs, and sales\nopportunities, driven by customers’ willingness to invest.\nAfter a strong contraction in 2020, the global economy is not yet back on track for the broad-\nbased recovery that had been hoped for. After a modestly positive start to 2020, the COVID-19\npandemic quickly became the dominating factor for economic development in many sectors. The\nglobal spread of the virus and its mutations, and the sometimes drastic containment measures,\nhave led to severe distortions in sales and procurement markets and in international supply\nchains, confronting countries, companies and consumers with a multi-faceted crisis. A number\nof vaccine approvals and the start of vaccination in some countries have raised hopes for a pos-\nsible end to the pandemic. The major burden of the economic downturn was in the first half of\n2020. Unprecedented fiscal, monetary, and regulatory measures helped to substantially mitigate\nthe economic impact of the pandemic in many places and allow for a swift recovery. This is also\nreflected in the forecast of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook\nof January 2021. For 2020 as a whole, the IMF expects global economic output to slump by -3.5%\nfollowing 2.8% growth in 2019. The expected growth rate for the advanced economies is -4.9%\n(2019: +1.6%), while the growth rate for the emerging and developing countries is expected to\nbe -2.4% (2019: +3.6%). Global trade is expected to contract by 9.6%. The situation in the strong-\nly export-oriented German machinery and plant engineering sector is correspondingly difficult.\nAccording to reports by the German Engineering Federation (Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und\nAnlagenbau e. V. (VDMA)), a 12%1 decline in order intake is reported for the first eleven months\nof 2020. In contrast, investment in manufacturing equipment for semiconductor wafers (wafer\nfront-end equipment) increased by 17% to almost USD 59 billion in 2020, according to estimates\nby investment bank UBS AG.\n1) VDMA: Order intake in mechanical engineering: Eastern Germany and Germany, November 2020\nIn terms of the AIXTRON Group’s business development, the downturn in the general global\neconomic environment in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, had only a minor impact.\nDemand for AIXTRON’s products is largely dependent on industry-specific developments, such as\nthe introduction of new applications in consumer electronics, or demand in sub-segments of the\nglobal semiconductor market, which remained stable overall, partly as a result of the digitaliza-\ntion trend, which was reinforced by the pandemic. Like many technology hardware companies,\nwe have so far weathered the COVID-19 pandemic wave without any significant impact on value\ncreation. In addition, we were able to maintain operations throughout the past fiscal year while\nadhering to strict protective measures for the safety of our employees. In addition, we were able\nto access a stable supply chain without interruption.\n69\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAfter the US dollar exchange rate was still very strong during the first wave of the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic in spring with rates around 1.08 USD/EUR, it weakened significantly in the further course\nof 2020. This was partly due to statements by the US Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) to focus more\nstrongly on high employment in the future and to keep interest rates low for a longer period of\ntime even as economic output and inflation picked up. The US dollar closed the year at 1.2232\nUSD/EUR on December 31, 2020 (2019: 1.122 USD/EUR), thus depreciating by almost 9% overall.\nAIXTRON applied an average USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.14 USD/EUR in fiscal year 2020 (Q1/2020:\n1.11 USD/EUR; Q2/2020: 1.10 USD/EUR; Q3/2020: 1.17 USD/EUR; Q4/2020: 1.18 USD/EUR), which\nwas about 2 percent above the prior year average (2019: 1.12 USD/EUR). This had a corresponding\nnegative impact on the Group’s sales revenues invoiced in US dollars.\nAIXTRON Management continues to carefully monitor the developments of the global economy\nand the financial markets to decide what can potentially be done to mitigate negative exogenous\neffects on AIXTRON’s business. In 2020, no forward exchange contracts or other hedging trans-\nactions were entered into. As of December 31, 2020, no currency hedging contracts were in place.\nThe Executive Board reserves the right to carry out hedging transactions in the future, should this\nbe deemed appropriate.\nCompetitive Positioning\nCompetitors in the market for CVD/MOCVD equipment are Veeco Instruments, Inc. (USA, “Veeco”),\nTaiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan, “TNS”), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan, “TEL”), Advanced Micro-Fabrica-\ntion Equipment Inc. (China, “AMEC”), Tang Optoelectronics Equipment Corporation Limited (China,\n“TOPEC”) as well as LPE (Italy) and Nuflare Technology Inc. (Japan, “Nuflare”). Other companies\nare also continuing to try to qualify their own MOCVD systems with their customers. For example,\nTechnology Engine of Science Co. Ltd. (South Korea, “TES”) and HERMES Epitek (Taiwan, “HERMES”)\nare working on the development of their own MOCVD system solutions and are trying to establish\nthem in the market.\nBased on the published financial results of competitors and own estimates, AIXTRON sees its\nglobal market leadership for MOCVD equipment in 2019 confirmed. AIXTRON thus holds the top\nposition for the fourth year in a row: accordingly, AIXTRON‘s market share amounted to 56%, fol-\nlowed by AMEC (China) with 25% and Veeco (USA) with 14%. At the same time, the global market\nfor MOCVD equipment stagnated in 2019 compared to the previous year, totaling USD 524 million\n(2018: USD 553 million).\nIn particular due to the limited differentiation potential in the blue LED market, AIXTRON is in-\ncreasingly focusing on markets for high-quality products, such as lasers for sensors or optical data\ncommunications, wide-band-gap power electronics or other LED applications (ROY LEDs or Micro\nLEDs).\nAIXTRON’s subsidiary APEVA competes with established manufacturers of vacuum thermal eva-\nporation (“VTE”) technologies such as Canon Tokki Corporation (Japan), Ulvac, Inc. (Japan), SNU\nPrecision (South Korea), Sunic System (South Korea), YAS (South Korea) as well as manufacturers\n70\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nof wet chemical printing technologies for e. g. polymer OLEDs such as Kateeva (USA), Panasonic\n(Japan), SEMES (South Korea), and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan) („TEL“) as well as a number of smal-\nler companies for equipment used in organic semiconductor applications. While these companies\nuse VTE and polymer technologies to produce OLEDs, APEVA uses the innovative organic vapor\ndeposition (OVPD) technology for large area coatings. APEVA believes that these technologies are\ntechnically superior to traditional VTE and polymer technologies and enable lower costs for ma-\nnufacturing OLEDs. APEVA positions itself as an alternative supplier of deposition equipment for\nthe large-scale production of next generation OLEDs as well as for applications such as displays,\nsolar cells and other OLED applications.\nKey Target Markets\nLED Market\nThe market for LEDs, which can be produced with AIXTRON compound semiconductor equipment,\nis divided into various applications, which are addressed by AIXTRON with appropriately adapted\nstrategies.\nRed, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) are used in mini-LED displays in large-format color dis-\nplays for sports stadiums, airports and shopping malls, as well as in automotive taillights or for\nagricultural technology, among other applications. In addition, televisions and monitors in the\npremium segment are increasingly being equipped with mini-LEDs. Thus, the market for red,\norange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) grew by 9% to USD 1.6 billion in 2019. The market for infrared\nand ROY LED manufacturing equipment is expected to double from 2020 to 2025, reaching USD\n108 million (Epitaxy Growth Equipment for More than Moore Devices Report, Yole, 2020). Accor-\nding to Yole, the demand for the global area of direct-emitting, large-area LED display walls is\ngrowing at an average rate of 63% per year between 2017 and 2024.\nAccording to LEDinside, the greatest growth potential in the field of LEDs is the market for Micro\nLEDs. Analysts expect Micro LEDs to be used initially in very small displays such as smartwatches\nand very large displays such as large-screen premium TVs. In the long term, other potential ap-\nplications include displays in smartphones, tablets and notebooks. The Micro LED technology is\nstill in the development stage, so that estimates of the future market size of various analysts\ndiverge widely. LEDinside, for example, predicts that the Micro LED market will grow from USD\n318 million in 2020 to USD 2.9 billion in 2025. As Micro LED technology matures, AIXTRON expects\nthat both the individual application fields and market sizes and the technical requirements will\nbecome clearer.\nAnother small segment of the LED market addressed by AIXTRON is the market for UV LEDs. These\nare used for curing plastics and - driven especially in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic - for disin-\nfecting surfaces, circulating air and (drinking) water. Due to increased hygiene awareness, this\nmarket could gain importance in the future. According to LED Inside (Deep UV LED Application\nMarket and Branding Strategies, LED Inside 2020), the ultraviolet LED (UV LED) market will grow at\n71\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\na very rapid rate from USD 305 million in 2019 to USD 1,021 million in 2024, at a compound annual\ngrowth rate of 27%.\nFor the application of blue LEDs for general lighting, only moderate growth is projected due to\nsaturation of the required production capacity on the one hand and due to continuously decrea-\nsing prices on the other hand. AIXTRON had already withdrawn from this application in 2017, in\nparticular due to the prevailing low price level.\nLaser based 3D Sensor Market\nLaser-based 3D sensors have been increasingly used in mobile phones since they were introdu-\nced to the market with the iPhone X in 2017. Apple is using this technology in its smartphones\nin the third generation and is now also using it in the tablet series. In addition, more and more\nmobile phone manufacturers are equipping their models with 3D sensors. In addition to sensors\non the display side of the mobile phone for facial recognition, more and more models are using\nadditional 3D sensors with a longer range on the back of the mobile phones, which can be used\nto detect the surroundings in three dimensions. Thus, consumer electronics will be the major\ndemand driver for laser-based 3D sensors in the next few years, according to market research firm\nYole Développement (Yole). Yole expects surface emitting lasers to grow from USD 738 million in\n2018 to USD 3.775 billion in 2024, representing a compound annual growth rate („CAGR“) of 31%.\nIn addition to consumer electronics applications, edge and surface emitting lasers are increasingly\nbeing used in the industrial and automotive sectors for 3D sensing. Yole expects a strong increase\nin demand for these components by 2024, especially from the automotive industry, as an element\nfor distance measurement in driver assistance systems and in automotive vehicles.\nLaser based Optical Data Transmission Market\nThe volume of data transmitted via fiber optic cable continues to grow exponentially, driven by\nthe increasing use of cloud computing and Internet services. Especially the growing use of vi-\ndeo-on-demand, as well as the communication of networked devices via the Internet (“Internet\nof Things”) contribute to increasing data volumes. In addition to data volumes, the enormously\nhigh transmission at the speed of light that is possible with optical data transmission also plays\na major role. Lasers, which can be produced on AIXTRON equipment, are key components for\nhigh-speed optical data transmission. The growth in global data traffic due to mobile telecommu-\nnications, the switch to 5G standards, and data transfer via optical fibers increase the demand for\nlasers as optical signal generators, photodiodes as receivers, and optical amplifiers and switches.\nMarket research companies such as OVUM, IDC or Frost & Sullivan expect that investments in\nlaser-based communication will continue to increase to enable the growing data traffic. For this\nreason, market research firm Strategies Unlimited predicts that the total number of lasers used\nin telecommunications will increase from 2020 to 2025 with an annual growth rate of 20.9%.\n72\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nMoreover, for the year 2025, Strategies Unlimited estimates a total market volume of more than\nUSD 5.8 billion.\nWide-Band-Gap (WBG) Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC)\nPower Semiconductor Market\nPower semiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials, which can be produced with\nAIXTRON equipment, enable the manufacture of very compact and highly efficient AC-DC and\nDC-DC converters. They are therefore increasingly used in a wide range of applications, from low\npower (e. g. power supply units for smart phones) to high power (e. g. fast charging stations for\nelectric vehicles). WBG power semiconductors reduce conversion losses by up to 50% and thus\ncontribute significantly to an increase in energy efficiency and reduction of CO2 emissions.\nGaN semiconductor devices are mainly used in low and medium power and voltage applications,\nsuch as power supplies for smartphones and laptops, wireless charging, and power supplies for\nservers and other IT infrastructure.\nAfter a long qualification phase, GaN devices in compact power supplies for smartphones and\nnotebooks reached significant volume for the first time in 2020. Compact chargers based on\nGaN devices are now offered by a variety of aftermarket companies. Similarly, GaN-based power\nswitches have been qualified for a variety of high-efficiency server power lines, which will be\nproduced in volume in the coming years. Other applications of GaN devices, such as use in the\ncompact on-board charger (OBC) for electric vehicles, are currently being prepared by customers.\nBased on the wide range of applications, Omdia analysts expected the GaN power semiconductor\nmarket to grow 63% to USD 41.4 million in 2020. Annual growth is expected to remain very high\nin 2022 and subsequent years, with a compound annual growth rate (CGAR) of 49.1% from 2019\nto 2029 to reach USD 1,376 million in 2029.\nFurthermore, GaN semiconductor devices are increasingly used in high frequency applications. In\n5G telecommunication networks and - likely - in subsequent network generations, the advantage\nof GaN technology of lower power losses at high frequencies comes into play. As a result, more\nand more manufacturers are shifting their production of high-frequency switches to GaN. Yole\nanalysts expect the market for GaN high-frequency semiconductor devices to grow from USD 740\nmillion in 2019 to USD 2 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%.\nSilicon carbide (SiC) WBG power devices have also seen strong tailwinds in 2020. They are particu-\nlarly suitable for use in higher power and voltage classes. Areas of application are primarily elec-\ntric vehicles and their fast-charging stations, but also photovoltaic and wind energy converters\nand other electric drives. In these applications, SiC enables a significant reduction in conversion\nlosses, resulting in a greater range per battery charge in vehicles and a higher amount of energy\ndelivered in the power generation sector.\nDriven by significantly increased awareness for the importance of CO2 reduction, both in the re-\n73\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\ngulatory and private sectors, vehicle manufacturers worldwide have been raising their targets for\npowertrain electrification. Volkswagen and BMW, for example, expect to deliver 30% and 50% of\ntheir vehicles with an electric powertrain by 2030.\nBased on this trend, the financial services firm Cannacord Genuity predicts that the market for SiC\ncomponents will grow from less than USD 1 billion at present to USD 10 billion in 2030. According\nto Cannacord, this is mainly due to the development of electric cars and the corresponding fast-\ncharging infrastructure.\nOLED Display Market\nIn recent years, the market for OLED displays has been significantly shaped by their use in mobile\nphones. In the coming years, APEVA expects the use of OLED displays to continue to increase in\nmobile devices, especially in the Chinese market. In addition, further growth in the OLED market\nis expected to result from the increasing prevalence of OLED televisions.\nDue to rising demand for OLED displays, this market segment is expected to show substantial\ngrowth potential in the medium to long term. For example, analysts at DSCC (Display Supply Chain\nConsultants), expect the market for OLED TV panels to grow from approximately 4 million square\nmeters in 2020 to approximately 15 million square meters in 2025. Foldable and flexible displays\nfor mobile applications are also important drivers for the OLED market. For these form factors,\nthe DSCC analysts expect the market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23%\nand the required display area to grow from 2.5 million square meters in 2020 to about 7 million\nsquare meters in 2025.\nBusiness Development\nThe 2020 fiscal year was significantly impacted by the ongoing tensions in global trade and un-\ncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom‘s exit from the EU (BREXIT) on the one hand and the\noutbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. Both events had a significant impact on the\neconomic situation of many companies and on global trade volumes. At AIXTRON, the negative\neffects were limited to isolated delays of equipment installations at customers, mainly in the first\nhalf of the year. Our supply chains as well as our production and administration functioned smoo-\nthly for the most part during the pandemic. We countered the BREXIT with a preventive increase\nin inventories of important components in both the UK and Germany. As a result, we have fully\nmet the forecast we made before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and which we maintained\nthroughout the year.\nDemand for AIXTRON products remained at a high level. High customer demand was mainly seen\nin systems for the production of lasers for optical data communication and 3D sensing, and in\nsystems for the production of energy-efficient power electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN)\nand silicon carbide (SiC), as well as in systems for the production of LEDs for display applications.\nOverall, we recorded an order intake of EUR 301.4 million in fiscal year 2020 (2019: EUR 231.9\n74\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nmillion), on par with the 2018 level of EUR 302.5 million. Revenues developed as expected and,\nat EUR 269.2 million (2019: EUR 259.6 million), were around 4% above the previous year‘s level.\nAt 40%, the gross margin was in line with expectations. Slightly higher operating costs combined\nwith continued significant future expenditures in R&D led to an operating result of EUR 34.8 mil-\nlion with an operating margin of 13% (2019: EUR 39.0 million; 15%). This resulted in a net profit\nof EUR 34,5 million (2019: EUR 32.5 million). Free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities\nadjusted for changes in financial assets - investments + proceeds from disposals) of EUR 14.0\nmillion (2019: EUR 35.1 million) was reported for the fiscal year 2020.\nWe achieved important milestones in the 2020 fiscal year for the fully automated AIX G5 WW C\nplanetary system for the efficient high-volume production of high-performance silicon carbide\npower electronics, which was introduced at the end of 2019. For example, the system has already\nbeen qualified by two customers for the production of SiC power semiconductors and additional\ncustomers have purchased the system to qualify our technology. Silicon carbide is a key com-\nponent of advanced power electronics systems currently being used in next-generation electric\nvehicles and will play a critical role in vehicle electric powertrains.\nAs part of our OLED qualification project, which is jointly run by engineers from our customer and\nour subsidiary APEVA, we achieved an important milestone in Q4 2020: With the final acceptance\nof the Gen2 deposition system by the customer, this phase of the qualification project on the way\nto commercialization of APEVA‘s proprietary technology has been successfully completed. APEVA\nis currently in talks with customers about a final qualification project for series production.\nIn order to continue to achieve a sustainable profitable development of the AIXTRON Group in the\nfuture, our product portfolio focuses exclusively on product lines with a positive contribution to\nearnings or those that promise a significant return on investment (ROI) in the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\n2020 2019 2018 2020-2019\nm EUR m EUR m EUR in EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 301.4 231.9 302.5 69.5 +30\nEquipment order backlog (end of period) 150.9 116.7 138.3 34.1 +29\nThe 2020 US dollar-based order intake and order backlog have been recorded at the budget\nexchange rate of 1.20 USD/EUR (2019: 1.20 USD/EUR; 2018: 1.20 USD/EUR). Spares & service orders\nare not included in the order backlog.\nIn 2020, total order intake including spares & services stood at EUR 301.4 million, thus higher\nthan the previous year’s figure. This development was driven in particular by increased demand\nfrom the fields of power electronics, especially GaN power electronics, and optoelectronics, espe-\ncially optical data communication. In Q4/2020, order intake at EUR 92.2 million was up 30%\nagainst the previous quarter (Q3/2020: EUR 70.8 million).\n75\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAt EUR 150.9 million, the equipment order backlog as of December 31, 2020 was also higher\nthan the order backlog of EUR 116.7 million at the beginning of 2020 (both at the budget rate of\n1.20 USD/EUR). Compared to the end of the previous quarter, the order backlog decreased by 8%\nat year-end (September 30, 2020: EUR 164.1 million).\nIn line with strict internal procedures, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be met for\nthe recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These conditions include the\nfollowing requirements:\n1. the receipt of a firm written purchase order,\n2. the receipt or securing of the agreed down payment,\n3. accessibility to the required shipping documentation,\n4. a customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date.\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Management Board reserves\nthe right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is sufficiently likely to\noccur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, Management comes to the conclusion that\nthe realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or involves an unacceptable degree of risk, Ma-\nnagement will exclude this specific order or a portion of this order from the recorded order intake\nand order backlog figures until the risk has decreased to an acceptable level. The order backlog is\nregularly assessed and - if necessary - adjusted in line with potential execution risks.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nThe development of revenues in fiscal year 2020 was primarily influenced by the demand for\nMOCVD systems, especially for the production of optoelectronics, particularly lasers for optical\ndata communication, for the production of power electronics, particularly GaN power electronics,\nand Specialty LEDs.\nRevenues in fiscal year 2020 amounted to EUR 269.2 million and were thus about 4% higher than\nin the previous year (2019: EUR 259.6 million; 2018: EUR 268.8 million). EUR 46,2 million or 17%\nof revenues in fiscal year 2020 were generated from the sale of spare parts and services. While\nrevenues from MOCVD systems for power electronics increased strongly compared to the previous\nyear, the optoelectronics business remained below the previous year‘s level, in particular due to\nthe expected low demand for laser systems for 3D sensor technology. The Specialty LEDs business\nwas also below the prior-year level overall. Systems for the manufacture of optoelectronic com-\nponents continued to make the largest revenue contribution, accounting for 33% of equipment\nrevenues. Systems for the manufacture of power electronics contributed 31% of equipment reve-\nnues, while systems for the manufacture of LEDs, incl. ROY-LEDs, accounted for 27%.\n76\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n2020 2019 2018 2020-2019\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 223.0 83 207.3 80 221.8 82 15.7 8\nService, spare parts, etc. 46.2 17 52.4 20 47.1 18 -6.1 -12\nTotal 269.2 100 259.6 100 268.8 100 9.6 4\nAt EUR 197.0 million, demand from customers in Asia continued to account for the majority of\ntotal revenues in 2020.

This was mainly due to a less favorable USD/\nEUR exchange rate especially in the second half of the year, a changed product mix and costs of\nunderutilization in production and service in the first half of the year. Consequently, the gross\nprofit for the fiscal year was EUR 108.3 million, corresponding to a gross margin of 40%.\nDevelopment of Results\n2020 2019 2018 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev.\nCost of sales 161.0 60 150.9 58 151.2 56 10.1 7\nGross profit 108.3 40 108.7 42 117.6 44 -0.4 0\nOperating expenses 73.5 27 69.7 27 76.2 28 3.8 5\nSelling Expenses 9.7 4 9.9 4 9.4 4 -0.2 -2\nGeneral and administra-\n18.0 7 16.5 6 18.4 7 1.5 9\ntion expenses\nResearch and develop-\n58.4 22 55.0 21 52.2 19 3.4 6\nment costs\nOther operating expenses\n(12.6) 5 (11.6) 4 (3.8) 1 1.0 9\n(income)\n77\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased slightly year-on-year in 2020, both in absolute terms and relative\nto revenues. In absolute terms, operating expenses increased from EUR 69.7 million in 2019 to\nEUR 73.5 million in the past fiscal year. This is mainly due to higher R&D expenses and an increase\nin general and administrative expenses.\nThe following individual effects must be taken into account:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were slightly higher in a year-on-year compa-\nrison at EUR 27.7 million (2019: EUR 26.4 million; 2018: EUR 27.7 million). Relative to revenues,\nselling, general and administrative expenses were stable at 10% (2019: 10%; 2018: 10%). The\nincrease was mainly due to higher variable cost components and higher recruitment costs for new\nemployees and the appointment of new members to the Executive Board.\nResearch and development expenses, including expenses for OLED development activities, in-\ncreased by 6% year-on-year to EUR 58.4 million. The increase is mainly due to the development of\nnext-generation MOCVD systems for applications within the defined core markets. Research and\ndevelopment expenses for OLED activities in 2020 were EUR 17.3 million (2019: EUR 16.7 million;\n2018: EUR 23.7 million).\nKey R&D Information\n2020 2019 2018 2020-2019\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 58.4 55.0 52.2 6%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 22 21 19\nNet other operating income and expenses in 2020 resulted in a stable income of EUR 12.6 mil-\nlion (2019: income of EUR 11.6 million, 2018: income of EUR 3.8 million).\nThese include grants of EUR 8.1 million for publicly funded development projects (2019: EUR 7.9\nmillion; 2018: EUR 4.7 million). Please refer to the section Research & Development included in\nthe chapter “Fundamental Information on the Group” for more information. In addition, due to\na change in use for one of the two production facilities in Germany, there was a reversal of an\nimpairment loss, which resulted in other operating income of EUR 2.9 million.\nIn fiscal year 2020, a net foreign exchange loss of EUR 0.8 million (2019: EUR 1.3 million gain;\n2018: EUR -1.8 million loss) was recorded from transactions in foreign currencies and the trans-\nlation of balance sheet items.\nTotal personnel costs, including production and service, were 10% higher in fiscal 2020 than in\nthe previous year at EUR 66.1 million (2019: EUR 60.3 million). This increase was mainly due to\nnew hires in the areas of development and production as well as higher variable compensation.\n78\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOperating Result (EBIT)\nThe operating result (EBIT) decreased year-on-year by 11% and amounted to EUR 34.8 million\nin the fiscal year 2020 (2019: EUR 39.0 million; 2018: EUR 41.5 million). This resulted in an EBIT\nmargin of 13% (2019: 15%; 2018: 15%). This development is mainly due to the revenue and cost\ndevelopment described above. For further information please refer to the “Consolidated income\nstatement” on page 107 of this report.\nResult before Tax\nProfit before tax decreased slightly from EUR 39,7 million in 2019 (2018: EUR 42.5 million) to\nEUR 35.1 million in 2020. This includes net interest income of EUR 0.2 million.\nInterest and Taxes\n2020 2019 2018 2020-2019\nm EUR m EUR m EUR m EUR %\nNet finance income 0.2 0.8 1.0 -0.6 -75\nFinance income 0.3 0.9 1.0 -0.6 -67\nFinance expense -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0\nTax income/(expense) -0.6 -7.2 3.4 6.6 -92\nIn fiscal year 2020, AIXTRON recorded an income tax expense of EUR 0.6m (2019: EUR 7.2m in-\ncome tax expense; 2018: EUR 3.4m income tax benefit). The decrease in income tax expense\nwas significantly influenced by the capitalization of deferred taxes on loss carryforwards due to\nexpected future profits. The disclosure on deferred taxes is included in Note 14 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nConsolidated net income for the year\nThe AIXTRON Group‘s consolidated net income in fiscal year 2020 was EUR 34.5 million, or 13%\nof revenues (2019: EUR 32.5 million, or 13%; 2018: EUR 45.9 million, or 17%).\nAssets and Liabilities\nThe Balance Sheet Total as of 31 December 2020 increased year-on-year to EUR 590.4 million (31\nDecember 2019: EUR 563.0 million; 31 December 2018: EUR 538.9 million). The complete consoli-\ndated statement of financial position can be found in the consolidated financial statements.\n79\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nAssets\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased slightly from EUR 64.5 million as of 31 December 2019\nto EUR 63,5 million as of 31 December 2020 (31 December 2018: EUR 63.1 million) as depreciation\nand amortization slightly exceeded capital expenditures and reversals of impairment losses in\nthe fiscal year.\nGoodwill was EUR 71.0 million compared to EUR 72.4 million as of December 31, 2019 (December\n31, 2018: EUR 71.6 million). The difference is completely due to exchange rate fluctuations. No\nimpairment losses were recognized. Further information on goodwill is provided in Note 12 „In-\ntangible assets“ in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther intangible assets increased to EUR 2.9 million as of 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019:\nEUR 2.4 million; 31 December 2018: EUR 2.1 million), which is due to higher capital expenditures.\nInventories were broadly unchanged at EUR 79.1 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 79.0 million;\nDecember 31, 2018: EUR 73.5 million). This mainly reflects the expected sales of systems in the\nfollowing quarters and the construction of prototypes. The inventory turnover rate at the end of\n2020 was 2.0 (2019: 1.9).\nAs deliveries within the last quarter of the past fiscal year were phased later than in the previous\nyear, trade receivables as of December 31, 2020 were significantly higher than the previous\nyear‘s level at EUR 41.3 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 29.2 million). The current days sales outs-\ntanding (DSO) decreased to 18 days at the end of 2020 compared to 30 days at the end of 2019\n(2018: 36 days).\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets increased to EUR 309.7 million as of December\n31, 2020 (31. December 2019: EUR 298.3 million; 31. December 2018: EUR 263.7 million). In this\ncontext, financial assets include fund investments of EUR 62.4 million as well as non-current\nbank deposits with a maturity of more than 12 months amounting to EUR 60.0 million, which\nare included in the balance sheet item other non-current financial assets. Please also refer to\nNotes 13, 17 and 18 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nLiabilities\nThe strong decrease in trade payables to EUR 10.8 million as of 31 December 2020 (31 December\n2019: EUR 19.4 million; 31 December 2018: EUR 27.8 million) reflects AIXTRON’s commitment to pay\nour suppliers in a timely manner and to avoid negative interest rates.\nProvisions (non-current and current) increased from EUR 18.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to\nEUR 20.2 million as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2018: EUR 20.8 million). The high number\nof systems delivered resulted in higher warranty provisions at the reporting date.\n80\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nContract liabilities for advance payments received from customers at EUR 50.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020 were broadly stable compared to the previous year’s level of EUR 51.1 million\nas of December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: EUR 53.3 million), reflecting the current order situ-\nation.\nMainly due to payments received for publicly funded development projects, other current liabili-\nties increased to EUR 7.4 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 4.2 million; December 31, 2018: EUR 5.0\nmillion).\nFinancial Position\nPrinciples and Objectives of Financial Management\nAIXTRON has a central financial management system whose primary objective is to ensure the\nlong-term financial strength of the Group. AIXTRONs financial management includes the cont-\nrol of its global liquidity as well as its interest and currency management. Financial processes\nand responsibilities are defined throughout the Group. The investment policy is approved by the\nSupervisory Board.\nOur capital structure management aims to determine an appropriate capital structure for each\nCompany within the Group while minimizing costs and risks. An appropriate structure must com-\nply with tax, legal and commercial requirements. The Group increases or decreases the share\ncapital within the Group companies as required.\nOur liquidity management aims to ensure the effective management of cash flows within each\nCompany of the group. The central finance department and local management monitor the cash\nflows within the group on a daily basis and take corrective action where necessary. Financing\nrequirements are covered by cash within the group, either through intra-group loans or through\nchanges in equity.\nThe principles of the investment policy are determined by the Supervisory Board of AIXTRON SE.\nExcess cash is invested by the finance department in accordance with this policy. The policy allows\nfor low-risk investments.\nDue to its global business operations, AIXTRON generates a portion of its revenues in foreign\ncurrencies, i. e. in currencies other than the Euro. The most prevalent foreign currency relevant for\nAIXTRON is the US dollar. Our central finance department routinely monitors if and to what extent\ncurrency hedging instruments should be used. Speculative foreign currency transactions are not\nconcluded.\nIn the semiconductor equipment industry, it is essential to have sufficient cash and cash equiva-\nlents at all times in order to be able to quickly finance possible business expansion. AIXTRON’s\ncurrent cash requirements are generally covered by cash inflows from operating activities. The\n81\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCompany can draw on a strong equity base to secure further corporate financing and to support\nits indispensable research and development activities. In addition, AIXTRON has the option, if\nnecessary and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue financial instruments on\nthe capital market to cover additional capital requirements.\nFinancing\nThe equity ratio as of December 31, 2020 increased slightly to 84% compared to 82% as of De-\ncember 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the share capital of AIXTRON SE amounted to EUR 112,927,320 (Decem-\nber 31, 2019: EUR 112,927,320; December 31, 2018: EUR 112,927,320). It is divided into 112,927,320\nregistered no-par value ordinary shares with a notional value of EUR 1.00 per share. All shares\nare fully paid. Please also refer to Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Group has stock option programs in place that granted the members of the Executive Board\nand employees the right to purchase AIXTRON shares under certain conditions. In 2020, no stock\noptions (2019: 0; 2018: 2,590 options) were exercised and no stock options were issued (2019: 0;\n2018: 0).\nAIXTRON ordinary shares\nDec.

In the previous year, there were short-term bank\ndeposits with a maturity of at least three months up to a maximum of twelve months in the\namount of EUR 27.5 million (see also „Investments“).\nThere are no restrictions on access to the Company‘s cash and cash equivalents.\nMainly due to the acquisition of fund investments in the amount of EUR 62.4 million, cash flow\nfrom operating activities amounted to EUR -39.2 million in fiscal year 2020 (2019: EUR 42.8\nmillion; 2018: EUR 11.9 million). Adjusted for this effect, the largest change in cash flow from ope-\nrating activities resulted from the change in trade receivables compared with the previous year\n(see also note on trade receivables).\nCash flow from investing activities in the 2020 fiscal year was EUR -41.5 million (2019: EUR -6.8\nmillion; 2018: EUR -15.1 million). This figure is mainly due to increased fixed-term deposits with a\nterm of more than 90 days (2020: EUR -32.5 million, 2019: EUR 0 million, 2018: EUR -7.5 million).\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -0.9 million in 2020 (2019: EUR -1.2 mil-\nlion; 2018: EUR 10.4 million). In 2020 and 2019, the cash outflow resulted mainly from repayments\nof lease liabilities.\nFree cash flow (cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in financial assets - in-\nvestments + proceeds from disposals) for the 2020 fiscal year was EUR 14.0 million compared to\nEUR 35.1 million in 2019 (free cash flow 2018: EUR 4.4 million). The difference compared to the\nprevious year is mainly due to cash outflows from trade receivables as of the reporting date (see\nnote on trade receivables). As a result of the first-time application of IFRS 16, the comparative\npresentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2019 in this report has been adjusted\naccordingly.\n83\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinancial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators\nAIXTRON’s key performance indicators are order intake, revenues, gross margin and EBIT mar-\ngin. These form the basis for group-wide operational and strategic planning. They are used to\npursue the goal of combining profitable revenue growth with cost and asset efficiency in order\nto achieve a sustainable increase in value. Thus, AIXTRON now focuses on four key performance\nindicators for the Group.\nSince fiscal year 2020, free cash flow is no longer used as a key performance indicator for AIX-\nTRON. Nevertheless, management continues to attach great importance on achieving sufficient\ncash flow to secure the Group‘s financial resources in the medium- and long-term.\nNon-financial performance indicators include energy consumption and the training activities of\nthe AIXTRON Group‘s employees for internal control and management purposes.\nManagement Assessment of Company Situation\nIn fiscal year 2020, AIXTRON continued to focus on successfully serving the targeted growth mar-\nkets in a sustainably profitable manner. At the same time, the Group continued to drive develop-\nment and sales activities, especially for power electronics.\nEquipment revenues in 2020 amounted to EUR 223.0 million, of which EUR 73.2 million (33%) was\nattributable to MOCVD systems for the production of components for the optoelectronics segment\n(laser, solar) and EUR 69.3 million (31%) to MOCVD/CVD systems for the power electronics seg-\nment (GaN/SiC). Growth is generally expected in the aforementioned markets because the use\nof lasers for optical data transmission continues to increase, because laser-based 3D sensors are\nincreasingly being used in consumer electronics, and because modern power electronics compo-\nnents are increasingly being manufactured from the materials silicon carbide or gallium nitride.\nMOCVD equipment revenues for the production of ROY LEDs in particular were EUR 61.0 million in\n2020 (27% of equipment revenues). The increasing penetration of displays or backlighting based\non mini-LED technology, of other LED applications such as disinfection or agricultural technology,\nor the ongoing development of Micro LED displays should have a positive impact on the demand\nfor our systems and show growth potential.\nIn addition to the above activities, there is a focus on costs as well as margin contributions of\nindividual revenue drivers. In addition, the Executive Board is continuously reviewing the product\nportfolio with a view to changing framework conditions, such as time windows for the market\nlaunch of new technologies or evaluation of our customers‘ product requirements.\nParticularly against the backdrop of a market environment characterized by uncertainty, business\ndevelopment in 2020 was very positive across all areas from a Group perspective. AIXTRON sees\nfurther growth potential for all addressed market areas over the next years.\n84\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe AIXTRON Group continues to have a healthy financing structure with a high level of cash and\ncash equivalents and no bank borrowings.\nAchievement of guidance in 2020\nIn order to give our stakeholders including our shareholders the opportunity to follow our busi-\nness development, we regularly publish our guidance for the current year with the publication of\nthe annual report of the previous year.

Both reports are published\nsimultaneously in the electronic Federal Gazette.\nThe annual financial statements of AIXTRON SE have been prepared in accordance with the Ger-\nman Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The individual finan-\ncial statements generally serve to determine the balance sheet profit or balance sheet loss and\nthus the possible distribution amount.\nBasically, the combined management report comprises all legally required information regarding\nAIXTRON SE. In addition to the reporting on the AIXTRON Group we explain the development of\nAIXTRON SE.\nAIXTRON SE is the parent Company of the AIXTRON Group and has its headquarters in Herzogen-\nrath, Germany. The AIXTRON SE Management is responsible for key management functions for\nthe Group, such as corporate strategy, risk management, investment management, executive\nand financial management, and communication with key target groups of the Group. AIXTRON SE\ngenerates the majority of its consolidated revenues through its operating activities of the de-\nvelopment, production, sale and maintenance of equipment for the deposition of semiconductor\nmaterials. In addition to seven subsidiaries held directly or indirectly at 100% each, which are\nprimarily responsible for the worldwide distribution of AIXTRON‘s products, AIXTRON SE currently\nholds an 87% interest in the APEVA Group, which is driving the development and evaluation of\nthe OVPD technology.\nAIXTRON SE is not managed separately using its own performance indicators because the Com-\npany is integrated into the Group management. We refer here to the respective explanations\nprovided for the Group. The economic framework conditions of AIXTRON SE are essentially the\nsame as those of the AIXTRON Group and are described in detail in the chapter Business Report.\n86\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIncome Statement of AIXTRON SE according to HGB\nEUR million 2020 2019\nRevenues 250.2 237.8\nChanges in inventories -6.0 4.9\nOther own work capitalized 0.2 0.1\nTotal output 244.4 242.8\nOther operating income 16.1 54.1\nCost of materials and external services 125.4 122.5\nPersonnel expenses 39.6 34.0\nDepreciation and amortization 10.7 8.3\nOther operating expenses 57.9 57.7\nOperating result 27.0 74.4\nIncome from investments 0.0 2.4\nInterest result 0.0 0.4\nFinancial result 0.0 2.8\nProfit before tax 27.0 77.2\nTaxes on income and earnings 2.9 5.0\nProfit after tax 24.1 72.2\nOther taxes 0.2 0.2\nNet profit for the year 23.9 72.0\nLoss (-)/profit carried forward (+) -5.6 -77.6\nNet retained profit (+)/loss (-) 18.4 -5.6\nResults of operations of AIXTRON SE according to HGB\nAIXTRON SE’s revenues amounted to EUR 250.2 million in fiscal year 2020 and thus increased by\nEUR 12.3 million, or 5%, compared with fiscal year 2019 (EUR 237.8 million). Revenues were in-\nfluenced by increased demand for MOCVD systems for the production of Specialty LEDs, GaN and\nSiC power electronics and lasers for optical data communication, among other things.

The following factors contributed to this development:\nAt 51.4%, the cost of materials ratio (cost of materials in relation to total output) was slightly\nabove the previous year’s figure (2019: 50.5%).\nThe annual average number of employees at AIXTRON SE rose from 387 in the previous year to\n431 in the fiscal year 2020. Consistent with this development, personnel expenses increased due\nto higher variable cost components from EUR 34.0 million in the previous year to EUR 39.6 million\nin fiscal year 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by EUR 2.3 million from EUR 8.3 million in 2019 to\nEUR 10.7 million in 2020. This was a result of additional depreciation due to shorter useful lives of\nsome laboratory equipment.\nOther operating expenses were stable at EUR 57.9 million compared to EUR 57.7 million in fiscal\nyear 2019, with higher currency losses and expenses for warranty provisions offset by lower costs\nfor external development services.\nIn comparison to 2019, other operating income decreased from EUR 54.1 million to EUR 16.1\nmillion in the 2020 fiscal year. In 2019, other operating income included an extraordinary income\nof EUR 39.2 million resulting from a return of capital contributions by a subsidiary. Adjusted for\nthis effect, other operating income increased by EUR 1.2 million, mainly due to income from re-\nversals of impairment losses resulting from a change in use for one of the two production sites\nin Germany.\nIn addition, no investment income was generated in 2020, while EUR 2.4 million was received\nfrom dividends from subsidiaries in fiscal year 2019.\nNet interest income totaled EUR 23 thousand in fiscal year 2020 compared to EUR 394 thousand\nin 2019.\n88\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nNet Result AIXTRON SE - Use of Result\nThe net result for the year amounted to EUR 23.9 million.

The HGB\nannual financial statements of AIXTRON SE as well as the consolidated financial statements will\nbe made available on the Internet at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nReport on Expected Developments, Opportunities\nand Risks\nExpected Developments\nFuture Market Environment\nIn its report „World Economic Outlook Update“ (January 2021), the IMF forecasts global economic\ngrowth of 5.5% in 2021 after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite all remaining un-\ncertainties, with the strength of the recovery expected to vary significantly between countries\ndepending on, among other things, access to healthcare, the effectiveness of political support\nand structural characteristics at the beginning of the crisis. At this point in time, AIXTRON does\nnot expect the general global economic environment to have a significant impact on its business\ndevelopment, although the visibility of customers‘ investment behavior is limited against the\nbackground of the still unresolved pandemic and the risk of renewed setbacks for the global\neconomy cannot be excluded.\nMarket observers are very positive about the development for production equipment in the semi-\nconductor industry in the coming years. According to a December 2020 study by SEMI, the leading\nglobal industry association, the total market for investments in so-called wafer fab equipment,\nwhich includes AIXTRON‘s deposition equipment, will increase from USD 59.6 billion in 2019 to\nUSD 76.1 billion in 2022. Of this, Korea, Taiwan, and China account for a large portion of the mar-\nket, representing approximately 30%, 25%, and 22% of the global market, respectively. According\nto SEMI, the growth of wafer fab equipment in this context is steadily positive, in contrast to\nearlier predictions - even in 2020 and despite any COVID-19 effects. Investments in new „leading\nedge“ technologies and demand for digital end products, e. g. for high-performance and cloud\ncomputing, are among the main drivers of this growth.\n93\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIrrespective of the market development of the semiconductor industry as a whole, the segments\non which AIXTRON focuses are determined by megatrends, the development of which will be\ndecisive for the future development and size of AIXTRON’s sales markets:\nSales of power semiconductors made of GaN and SiC materials are mainly driven by the need to\nincrease energy efficiency in global IT infrastructure and data centers in order to curb the rapid\nincrease in energy consumption. It is expected that the use of electric vehicles in the future will\nlead to an increased use of SiC components both, in the powertrain and in the charging infrastruc-\nture in order to better meet the requirements for range and efficiency.\nThe increasing demand for lasers manufactured on AIXTRON systems is due to the exponentially\ngrowing need for fast and energy-efficient optical data communications (cloud computing, video\nstreaming, etc.) as well as the adoption of 3D sensing in consumer electronics (smart phones,\ntelevisions) and in access control areas. Also, the progress of industrial digitization and a growing\nnumber of semi-autonomous vehicles that use 3D sensing technology will lead to increased de-\nmand for lasers.\nFinally, AIXTRON’s future markets will be determined by the adoption of novel displays in TVs,\nsmartphones and notebooks: both Micro LED displays, whose self-luminous LED pixels can be\nproduced on AIXTRON MOCVD systems, and OLED displays, which can be produced on the OVPD\nsystems of APEVA, are aimed at replacing today’s LCD screen technology with innovative, energy-\nsaving alternatives with better brightness, contrast, color fidelity and resolution. The adoption of\nthese novel display technologies will significantly determine the size of AIXTRON’s sales markets.\nExpected Results of Operations and Financial Position\nFor the fiscal year 2021, the Group expects a positive revenue development compared to 2020,\nwith customer demand spanning all technology areas. The Executive Board is optimistic about\nboth the favorable short- and long-term outlook, both for demand for MOCVD equipment for\nthe manufacture of lasers for 3D sensor technology or optical data transmission, as well as for\nLED-based display applications. In particular, with regard to the demand for equipment for the\nproduction of power devices based on the wide band gap materials SiC- and GaN (silicon carbide,\ngallium nitride), the Executive Board again expects an increasing revenue contribution in 2021\ncompared to 2020.\nBased on the current corporate structure, an assessment of the order situation and the budget\nrate of 1.25 USD/EUR (2020: 1.20 USD/EUR), the Executive Board expects order intake in a range\nbetween EUR 340 million and EUR 380 million for the Group in fiscal year 2021. With revenues in\na range between EUR 320 million and EUR 360 million, the Executive Board expects to achieve a\ngross margin of approximately 40% and an EBIT margin of approximately 16% of sales in fiscal\nyear 2021. The expectations for 2021 fully include the results of the APEVA Group including all\nnecessary investments to further drive the development of the OLED activities and are under the\nassumption that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have no significant impact on the develop-\nment of our business.\n94\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFurthermore, with a view to the AIXTRON Group‘s sustainability goals, which were redefined in\n2020, we are aiming for a discernible reduction in energy consumption in the medium term, as\nwell as a significant expansion of further training measures for our employees.\nAs in previous years, the Executive Board expects that AIXTRON will not require external bank\nfinancing in fiscal year 2021. Furthermore, the Group will also maintain its solid equity base for\nthe foreseeable future.\nOverall Statement on the Future Development\nAIXTRON‘s equipment enables the production of lasers as key components for high-speed opti-\ncal data transmission (cloud computing, Internet of Things), high-frequency chips for 5G mobile\nnetworks, or for the production of next-generation displays (OLED displays, Mini- and Micro LED\ndisplays). AIXTRON technology also enables highly efficient energy conversion in the field of\npower supply for server farms or consumer electronics, or for electric vehicles and their charging\ninfrastructure (GaN and SiC devices). Lasers, which can be manufactured on AIXTRON equipment,\nare key components, for example, for 3D sensor technology in smartphones or in increasingly\ncomplex vehicle assistance systems.\nBased on AIXTRON‘s proven ability to develop and market innovative deposition equipment in\nflexible numbers for multiple customer markets, the Executive Board is convinced of the positive\nfuture prospects for the Group and its target markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, AIXTRON did not have any legally binding agreements regarding finan-\ncial investments, acquisitions or disposals companies or businesses.\nRisk Report\nRisk Management System\nAIXTRON’s risk management system is centrally controlled and involves all major organizational\nunits of the AIXTRON Group in the process. The Board Member of AIXTRON SE in charge of the\nCompliance area is responsible for establishing an effective risk management system and informs\nthe Executive Board and Supervisory Board at regular intervals or, if necessary, ad-hoc.\nThe primary objectives of the system are to support the achievement of strategic business objec-\ntives and to identify potential risks at an early stage that could negatively affect their achieve-\nment. The risk management system supports the Executive Board in the systematic and rational\nmanagement of identified risks by defining, prioritizing and tracking of risk-reducing measures.\nThe periodic quarterly risk inventory is initiated and monitored by the central risk manager. All\nrisk officers from the operating divisions are questioned about current developments of already\n95\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nidentified risks and measures to reduce them. The results are compiled at a central level and\ndiscussed in a risk committee prior to informing the Supervisory Board.\nAIXTRON uses a risk management software to support the process. All risk officers have access\nto the system. This ensures that abrupt changes in the risk situation or newly identified risks are\nreported by the risk officers from the operating divisions and integrated into the risk portfolio or\nthe risk reporting.\nAt AIXTRON, all single risks are assessed and classified applying the same method. The probability\nof occurrence is measured in four categories, as is the potential amount of loss if the risk mate-\nrializes. The amount of loss relates to the impact on the AIXTRON Group’s operating result (EBIT);\nin individual cases, a possible cash outflow is used as the amount of loss. The probability of risks\noccurring is broken down into:\n• Remote = < 5%\n• Unlikely = 5% - 10%\n• Possible = >10% - 50%\n• Likely = >50% - 100%\nWherever possible, risks with a probability of occurrence of more than 50% are recognized as\nprovisions in the financial statements or taken into account in planning. In addition, the recogni-\ntion of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is also reviewed for lower probabilities of\noccurrence. Please refer to Note 28 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe criterion used to assess the potential financial impact of a risk on the AIXTRON Group’s ear-\nnings (EBIT) is the potential net loss (measured as a percentage of equity):\n• Acceptable = <0.4%\n• Relevant = 0.4% - 2%\n• Serious = >2% - 4%\n• Critical = > 4%\n96\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nThe net loss describes the potential loss in the event of a risk occurring, taking into account the\neffects resulting from the risk reduction measures. A risk matrix is derived from this assessment,\nwhich divides the risks of the AIXTRON Group into the following four risk classes according to their\nimportance or urgency (see chart for color scale):\n• Acceptable Risk (green)\n• Relevant Risk (yellow)\n• Serious Risk (orange)\n• Substantial Risk (red)\nThe risks classified as substantial are those that are significant in terms of the threat to the\nAIXTRON Group as a going concern as defined by German Accounting Standard (GAS) 20.\nRisk Map\n97\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\negamad\nfo\ntnuomA\nCritical\nSerious\nRelevant\nAcceptable\nRemote Unlikely Possible Likely\nProbability of occurrence\nSingle Risk Factors\nThe following risks could potentially have a substantially adverse impact on the revenue, the\nfinancial position, the net assets, the Company’s liquidity and the market price of the AIXTRON\nshare, and on the actual outcome of matters which the forward-looking statements contained in\nthis annual report refer to. The risks described below are not the only ones the Group faces. There\nmay be additional risks that AIXTRON is currently unaware of, as well as general corporate risks\nsuch as political risks, the risk of force majeure and other unforeseeable events. There may also\nbe risks that AIXTRON currently considers to be immaterial, but which may ultimately also have a\nsignificantly adverse effect on the Group. Further information on forward-looking statements can\nbe found in the section „Forward Looking Statements”.\nThe following risks were assessed as material according to DRS 20:\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInformation technology (IT) and information security (IS) risks\nInformation is a valuable asset for AIXTRON which needs to be protected adequately. Due to\nincreasing digitization and interconnectedness, a large proportion of information is generated,\nprocessed and stored with IT systems. Therefore, the security of information and IT systems are\nmutually dependent. AIXTRON defines IT and IS risks as a violation of the integrity, confidentiality\nor asset availability.\nThe Group has implemented comprehensive technical and organizational measures to protect\ninformation from unauthorized access, unwanted modification or deletion. The measures taken\nto ensure information security are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary. By continuous-\nly sensitizing employees, they are enabled to take personal responsibility for ensuring greater\nsecurity in handling IT-supported information and to adequately counter the threats and risks\nassociated with handling IT-supported information assets.\nDue to the complexity of today’s IT environment and increasingly intense threats, AIXTRON cannot\nfully rule out that information assets may be compromised nor a subsequent unauthorized disc-\nlosure or manipulation of information assets.\nIn part, AIXTRON uses external service providers to provide IT services and systems. Reputation,\nsecurity aspects and the compliance of service providers with the requirements of the data pro-\ntection regulation play a key role in their selection.\nThe categorization as a significant risk is based on the possible probability of occurrence and a\nsignificant level of damage. The elimination of damage in the event of a breach of the integrity,\nconfidentiality and/or asset availability that AIXTRON classifies as critical would involve a high\nfinancial expense that is nonetheless not considered to be a threat to the Group’s continued\nexistence.\nMarket- and competition-related risks\nAIXTRON’s target markets are globally distributed, with a regional focus on Asia. AIXTRON is the-\nrefore exposed to global economic cycles and geopolitical risks, e. g. the trade conflict between\nthe USA and China, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s business. Such risks cannot\nbe influenced by the Group.\nThe markets addressed by the Group may be cyclical and therefore extremely volatile. The timing,\nduration and intensity of these industry cycles are difficult to predict and to be influenced by the\nGroup. In order to spread market-related risks, AIXTRON therefore diversifies and offers products\nin different markets.\nAIXTRON competes with other companies in each of these markets. There is always the possibility\nthat new competitors may enter the market, or that established competitors may adopt strate-\n98\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\ngies or bring products to market that could adversely affect AIXTRON’s business development.\nThe Group continuously monitors and assesses market developments. In order to reduce the\nrisk of dependence on individual markets and their fluctuations, AIXTRON has implemented a\nmanagement system to ensure that market developments are recognized at an early stage and\nexploited optimally.\nThe reason why market- and competition-related risks are classified as substantial risks is to be\nseen in AIXTRON’s high medium to long-term sales and profit expectations.\nTechnological risks\nThe technologies offered by AIXTRON are in part enabling new and disruptive applications. This\noften means long sales and qualification cycles for the Company’s products, as demanding tech-\nnical or other customer specifications have to be met (sometimes for the first time) before a\nbusiness transaction can be concluded.\nDue to the often long development and qualification cycles for many of AIXTRON‘s products,\nAIXTRON may develop technologies and products for markets or application areas in which the\ngeneral conditions of the sales markets or the strategic plans of potential customers change fun-\ndamentally during the development cycle.\nThe continued focus on research and development activities in the past fiscal year and the inten-\nsive involvement of external technology partners are still considered by the Group‘s management\nto be suitable measures to reduce this risk.\nThe OVPD process, developed by APEVA together with a customer and aimed at the manufacture\nof deposition equipment for the deposition of organic semiconductor materials, is such an innova-\ntive technology. The business purpose of APEVA is the development, qualification and production\nof the technology for the production of OLED displays at customer sites.\nQualification of the Gen2 facility was successfully completed by APEVA in fiscal 2020. At the time\nof preparation of the management report, no order for a production-size OVPD deposition cham-\nber has been placed. Should such an order for a production-size OVPD deposition chamber fail\nto materialize, this would represent a development-impairing fact that could develop into a go-\ning-concern risk for APEVA. From today‘s perspective it appears possible that in this case APEVA‘s\nbusiness operations would be discontinued.\nThis could have a negative impact on the future results of operations of the AIXTRON Group in the\nform of restructuring and liquidation expenses. Such expenses explicitly do not represent a going\nconcern risk for AIXTRON at this point in time.\nThe reason why AIXTRON generally classifies technology risks as substantial risks is based on the\nGroup‘s high medium to long-term revenue and profit expectations. If it turns out that a technolo-\n99\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\ngy risk has materialized and the introduction of a new technology cannot be realized as planned,\nthis could result in planned and forecast revenues being exposed to the risk of postponement or\ncancellation, and development activities thus being refinanced later than planned or not at all.\nAIXTRON’s risk management system considers the following risks to be not material to the Group:\n• Currency risk and other financial risks\n• Sourcing and production risks\n• Staff-related risks\n• Legal risks\n• Risks relating to patents and intellectual property\n• COVID-19 pandemic\nThe progress and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are being continuously monitored. For this\npurpose, among other things, a crisis team has been formed and protective and preventive mea-\nsures have been introduced. In addition, the Executive Board regularly communicates the current\nsituation - i. e., current developments in general and at AIXTRON, as well as the measures derived\ntherefrom - to the employees. As part of risk management, the effects, measures, and outlook\nregarding the current pandemic situation are recorded, discussed, and reported in our quarterly\nrisk inventory.\nOverall picture of the risk situation of AIXTRON SE\nCompared to fiscal year 2019, the overall risk situation of AIXTRON SE and its subsidiaries in 2020\nremains unchanged. The further focusing of research and development activities, with a focus\non the renewal of the product portfolio, streamlines the risk portfolio and thus improves the ex-\nploitation of opportunities and the active avoidance of risks in the markets AIXTRON addresses.\nNeither in fiscal year 2020 nor at the time of writing this Management Report has the Executive\nBoard of AIXTRON SE identified risks to the Company that could threaten its continued existence.\nEven if the existential risk for APEVA were to occur, the consequences for the entire Group would\nnot be a threat to its continued existence.\nOpportunities Report\nAIXTRON’s core competence is the development of cutting-edge technology for the precise de-\nposition of complex semiconductor structures and other functional materials. The Company has\nachieved globally leading positions in these areas. In order to defend or expand these positions,\nAIXTRON invests in appropriate research and development projects, such as for MOCVD systems to\n100\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nproduce semiconductors for use in lasers, power electronics or LEDs. Management will maintain\nthe focus on this core competence in order to successfully develop both existing as well as new\nmarkets.\nImportant market segments in optoelectronics include consumer electronics, data communicati-\nons and display technology. The trend towards optical data transmission also across shorter dis-\ntances, e.g. in data centers, as well as the application of 3D sensor systems in mobile end devices\nsuch as especially smartphones, is generating an increasing demand for edge emitting laser (EEL)\nand surface emitting laser (VCSEL) systems. AIXTRON anticipates a further increase in demand\nover the coming years in this area. In addition, AIXTRON notes continuously high demand for sys-\ntems for the production of red-orange-yellow (ROY), infrared and UV LEDs. An additional growth\nsegment in the area of optoelectronic applications are direct-emitting LED displays. A commercial\ndeployment of Micro LED displays in particular has the potential to generate significant system\ndemand for this demanding application. These display technologies have potential in a diverse\nnumber of end applications within consumer electronics.\nImportant market segments for power electronics based on wide-band-gap materials such as\ngallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are the automotive, energy, telecommunications\nand consumer electronics industries. The development of energy-efficient solutions for AC-DC\nconverters, inverters and high-frequency power amplifiers are increasingly gaining in importance.\nThe trend towards electrification of vehicles and there charging infrastructure using SiC-based\ncomponents plays an important role in this regard. GaN-based components, e. g. for fast and/or\nwireless charging of mobile devices, are in the market launch phase. GaAs-based or GaN-based\nhigh frequency components will be used among others for the signal transmission of 5G net-\nworks. In these fields, AIXTRON expects demand for production systems to increase as the market\npenetration of these applications increasingly gains momentum.\nFollowing the completion of the Gen2 project, APEVA is currently conducting customer discus-\nsions on a final qualification project for series production. The OVPD technology enables highly\nefficient deposition of organic materials especially on large area substrates and offers a number\nof advantages over currently used technologies, especially in material consumption and yield.\nSuccessful qualification of OVPD technology at production scale would open up significant growth\nopportunities in the display sector.\nAIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end user markets\ncould possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term:\n• Increasing adoption of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensor systems in\nmobile devices as well as sensors for infrastructure applications.\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for optical data transmission of large volumes, such as\nfor video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.\n101\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) for displays and\nother applications.\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based components for energy-efficient\npower electronics devices in autos, in consumer electronics, in mobile devices and in IT\ninfrastructure.\n• Increasing use of GaAs-based devices in mobile devices (e. g. smartphones) for 5G mobile\ncommunications\n• Increasing use of GaN-based devices in the field of 5G network infrastructure\n• Order for production-scale qualification of OVPD technology\nMid- to Long-Term:\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated power management.\n• Adaptation of Micro LED displays in the mass market\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual-light communication\ntechnology or Micro LED displays.\n• Increased use of compound semiconductor-based laser sensors for autonomous driving.\n• Use of GaN-based devices in mobile terminals (e. g. smartphones) for the millimeter-wave\nrange of 5G and 6G mobile communications.\n• Increased development activities for high performance solar cells made of compound\nsemiconductor.\nOverall Picture of Opportunities\nAs part of the assessment of our business opportunities, options for investments or development\nprojects are reviewed and prioritized for their potential value contribution to ensure an effective\nallocation of resources. We focus specifically on growth markets that are positively influenced by\nglobal trends such as increasing electromobility, digitization, and networking, among others, in\norder to systematically and optimally exploit the opportunities that arise for the sustainable and\nprofitable business development of the Group.\nShould identified opportunities be considered probable, then these are included in the business\nplans and short-term forecasts. Any further trends or events that could lead to a positive develop-\nment for our net assets, financial position and results of operations are being observed and may\nhave a positive impact on our medium to long-term prospects.\n102\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nGROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT\nInternal Control System ICS\nThe AIXTRON Group’s internal control system covers both the accounting process of AIXTRON SE\nand the Group accounting process. It defines controls and monitoring activities that are measures\ndesigned to ensure the proper conduct of business activities, reliable financial reporting, and\ncompliance with laws and regulations. An appropriate control system, taking into account the\nsize of the Company and its business activities, is essential to effectively manage operational,\nfinancial and other risks.\nControls are defined at risk points in the accounting process to help ensure that the consolidated\nfinancial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules. A separation of functions appro-\npriate to the size of the Company and the application of the dual control principle reduce the risk\nof fraudulent acts.\nA global IT system is used to prepare the annual financial statements and the consolidated finan-\ncial statements and for consolidation, ensuring uniform and consistent procedures and data secu-\nrity.

The amounts are rounded to\nthe nearest thousand Euro (kEUR).\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revalua-\ntion of certain financial instruments.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclo-\nsures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of\nincome and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to ac-\ncounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if this revision\naffects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects\nboth current and future periods. Judgments which have a significant effect on the Group’s finan-\ncial statements are described in note 35.\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in\nthese consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently by each consolidated Company.\n(C) Bases of consolidation\n(I) Subsidiaries\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and\nentities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control\nis achieved when the Company:\n• has the power over the investee;\n114\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n• has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate\nthat there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\nEntities over which AIXTRON SE has control are treated as subsidiaries (see note 30). The results\nof subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control\ncommences until the date that control ceases.\n(II) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\nAll interCompany income and expenses, transactions and balances have been eliminated in the\nconsolidation.\n(D) Foreign currency\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Euro (EUR). In the translation of\nfinancial statements of subsidiaries outside the Euro-Zone the local currencies are also the func-\ntional currencies of those companies. Assets and liabilities of those companies are translated to\nEUR at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to\nEUR at average exchange rates for the year or at average exchange rates for the period between\ntheir inclusion in the consolidated financial statements and the balance sheet date. Net equity is\ntranslated at historical rates. The differences arising on translation are disclosed in the Consolida-\nted Statement of Changes in Equity.\nExchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates in the case of foreign\ncurrency transactions are recognized in the income statement in “Other operating income“ or\n“Other operating expenses“.\n115\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(E) Property, plant and equipment\n(I) Acquisition or manufacturing cost\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, plus ancillary charges such as instal-\nlation and delivery costs, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see\naccounting policy (J)).\nCosts of internally generated assets include not only costs of material and personnel, but also a\nshare of directly attributable overhead costs, such as employee benefits, delivery costs, installa-\ntion, and professional fees.\nWhere parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are\ndepreciated as separate items of property, plant and equipment.\n(II) Subsequent costs\nAIXTRON recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the\ncost of replacing components or enhancement of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is\nprobable that the future economic benefits embodied in the item will flow to the Group and the\ncost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs such as repairs and maintenance are\nexpensed as incurred.\n(III) Government grants\nGovernment grants related to the acquisition or manufacture of owned assets are deducted from\noriginal cost at the date of capitalization.\n(IV) Depreciation\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an\nitem of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives, depreciation method and residual values of\nproperty, plant and equipment are reviewed at the year-end date or more frequently if circums-\ntances arise which are indicative of a change. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\n• Buildings 25 - 45 years\n• Machinery and equipment 3 - 19 years\n• Other plant, factory and office equipment 2 - 20 years\nThe useful lives of leased assets do not exceed the expected lease periods.\n116\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(V) Leased assets\nThe Group applied IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 using the cumulative catch-up approach and there-\nfore comparative information has not been restated and is presented under IAS 17. The details of\naccounting policies under both IAS 17 and IFRS 16 are presented separately below.\nPolicies applicable from 1 January 2019.\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, at inception of the contract. The\nGroup recognises a lease asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arran-\ngements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease\nterm of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as tablets and personal compu-\nters, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these leases, the Group recognises the\nlease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless\nanother systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits\nfrom the leased assets are consumed.\nAIXTRON recognises a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The\nleased asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial\ndirect costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to\nrestore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\nThe leased asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commence-\nment date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the expected end of the lease\nterm. The estimated useful lives of leased assets are determined on the same bases as those of\nproperty, plant and equipment. In addition, the leased asset is periodically tested and reduced by\nimpairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not\npaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that\nrate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments,\nless any lease incentives and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially\nmeasured using the index or rate at the commencement date.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remea-\nsured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in index or rate,\nor if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or\ntermination option.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the\ncarrying amount of the leased asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the\nleased asset has been reduced to zero.\n117\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.\nPolicies applicable prior to 1 January 2019.\nPrior to 2019 all leases were classified as operating leases. Rental payments for assets under\noperating leases were recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLease incentives received were recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over\nthe lease term.\n(F) Intangible assets\n(I) Goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is allocated to cash-ge-\nnerating units and is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy (J)).\n(II) Research and development\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical know-\nledge and understanding using scientific methods, is recognized as an expense as incurred.\nExpenditure on development comprises costs incurred with the purpose of using scientific know-\nledge technically and commercially. As not all criteria of IAS 38 are met AIXTRON does not capi-\ntalize such costs.\n(III) Other intangible assets\nOther intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortization (see\nbelow) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (J)).\nIntangible assets acquired through business combinations are stated at their fair value at the date\nof purchase.\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and patents is expensed as incurred.\n(IV) Subsequent expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure on capitalized intangible assets is capitalized only when it increases the\nfuture economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure\nis expensed as incurred.\n118\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(V) Amortization\nAmortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible\nassets, except for goodwill. Goodwill has a useful life which is indefinite and is tested annually\nin respect of its recoverable amount. Other intangible assets are amortized from the date they\nare available for use. Useful lives and residual values of intangible assets are reviewed at the\nyear-end date or more frequently if circumstances arise which are indicative of a change. The\nestimated useful lives are as follows:\n• Software 2 - 5 years\n• Patents and similar rights 4 - 18 years\n• Customer base and product and technology know how 6 - 10 years\n(G) Financial Instruments\n(I) Financial Assets\nFinancial assets are classified into the following specific categories: financial assets ‘at fair value\nthrough profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and\nAmortized Cost. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and\nis determined at the time of initial recognition.\n(II) Financial assets at FVTOCI\nAIXTRON did not have any financial assets in these categories during the periods covered by this\nreport.\n(III) Financial assets at Amortized Cost\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost as they are held within a business model to\ncollect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(IV) Financial assets at FVTPL\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI under IFRS 9 are mea-\nsured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any\nfair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss including dividends earned\non financial asset and is included in profit and loss account and in note 5 or 6 respectively. Fair\nvalue is determined in accordance to IFRS 13.\n(V) Trade receivables\nTrade receivables and other receivables are measured at amortized cost as they are held within a\n119\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbusiness model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments\nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(VI) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables and\ncontract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect\nchanges in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group al-\nways recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables, and contract assets. The expected credit losses\non these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical\ncredit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic\nconditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions\nat the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been a sig-\nnificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial\ninstrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss\nallowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. Lifetime ECL repre-\nsents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected\nlife of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that\nis expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12\nmonths after the reporting date.\n(VII) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with banks with a maturity of less\nthan three months at inception.\n(VIII) Equity instruments\nEquity instruments, including share capital, issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\n(IX) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities “at FVTPL” or “Amortized Cost“.\n(X) Financial liabilities at FVTPL\nAIXTRON did not have any financial liabilities in this category during the periods covered by this\nreport.\n(XI) Financial liabilities at Amortized Cost\nOther financial liabilities, including trade payables, are measured at amortized cost.\n120\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(XII) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange currency rates\n(see note 25). AIXTRON may use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.\nAIXTRON does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of finan-\ncial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Executive Board, which provide written\nprinciples on the use of financial derivatives.\nAIXTRON did not have any derivative financial instruments in the periods covered by this report.\n(H) Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion\nand selling expenses. Cost is determined using weighted average cost.\nThe cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their\nexisting location and condition. In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes\ndirect material and production cost, as well as an appropriate share of overheads based on nor-\nmal operating capacity. Scrap and other wasted costs are expensed on a periodic basis either as\nCost of Sales or, in the case of beta tools as Research and Development expense.\nAllowance for slow moving, excess and obsolete, and otherwise unsaleable inventory is recorded\nbased primarily on either the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement\nor historical usage. When the estimated future demand is less than the inventory, AIXTRON writes\ndown such inventories.\n(I) Operating Result\nOperating result is stated before finance income, finance expense and tax.\n(J) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and\nintangible assets\nGoodwill purchased as part of a business acquisition is tested annually for impairment, irrespecti-\nve of whether there is any indication of impairment. For impairment test purposes, the goodwill\nis allocated to cash-generating units. Impairment losses are recognized to the extent that the\ncarrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value in use of the cash-\ngenerating unit. Details of impairment test are shown in note 12.\nProperty, plant and equipment as well as other intangible assets are tested for impairment, whe-\nre there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. The Group assesses at the end of each\n121\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nperiod whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Impairment losses on such\nassets are recognized, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds both the fair value that\nwould be obtainable from a disposal in an arm’s length transaction, and the value in use.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value\nusing a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks associated\nwith the asset.\nImpairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine\nthe recoverable amount. Reversals are made only to the extent that the carrying amount of the\nasset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment\nloss had been recognized.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n(K) Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average\nnumber of issued common shares for the year. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential\ndilution that could occur if options issued under the Company’s stock option plans were exercised,\nunless such exercises had an anti-dilutive effect.\n(L) Employee benefits\n(I) Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an expense\nin the income statement as incurred.\n(II) Share-based payment transactions\nStock option programs\nThe stock option programs allows members of the Executive Board, management and employees\nof the Group to acquire shares of AIXTRON SE. These stock option programs are accounted for\naccording to IFRS 2 for equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of options\ngranted is recognized as personnel expense with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in\ncapital. The fair value is calculated at grant date and spread over the period during which the\nemployees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted\nis measured using a mathematical model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon\nwhich the options were granted. The vesting conditions relate to a service condition and a market\ncondition in relation to the share price of AIXTRON SE. In the calculation of the personnel expense\noptions forfeited during the performance period are taken into account.\n122\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-term incentives\nExecutive Board remuneration system at AIXTRON SE consists long-term variable remuneration\nincentives granted in shares of AIXTRON SE. These equity-settled share-based payments are mea-\nsured at fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value of the shares granted\nis measured using a mathematical model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon\nwhich the shares were granted. Further details regarding the equity-settled share-based trans-\nactions are set out in note 22 and 29.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is ex-\npensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period, based on the Group’s estimate of\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. For non-market-based vesting conditions,\nthe Group reviews its estimate of number of equity instruments at each reporting date during\nperformance period. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in\nprofit or loss and a corresponding adjustment is recognized to equity.\n(M) Provisions\nA provision is recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result\nof a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle\nthis obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected\nfuture cash flows at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market assessments of the time\nvalue of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.\n(I) Warranties\nThe Group normally offers one or two year warranties on all of its products. Warranty expenses\ngenerally include cost of labor, material and related overhead necessary to repair a product free\nof charge during the warranty period. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties may\nvary depending on the equipment sold, the terms of the contract and the locations from which\nthey are sold. The Group establishes the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations\nand records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that\naffect the warranty liability include the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and\ncost per claim.\nThe Group accrues warranty cost for systems shipped based upon historical experience. The Group\nperiodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty provisions and adjusts the amounts\nas necessary.\nExtended warranties, beyond the normal warranty periods, are treated as maintenance services\nin accordance with (N) below.\n123\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(II) Onerous contracts\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected economic benefits to be deri-\nved by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations\nunder the contract. The amount recognized as a provision is determined as the excess of the\nunavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract over the economic benefits\nexpected to be received. Before making that provision any impairment loss that has occurred on\nassets dedicated to that contract are recognized. The provision is discounted to present value if\nthe adjustment is material.\n(N) Revenue\nAIXTRON enters contracts with customers for goods and services, including combinations of goods\nand services. Contracts are usually for fixed prices and do not offer any unilateral right of return\nto the customer.\nRevenue is generated from the following major sources:\n• sale of equipment\n• installation of equipment\n• sale and installation of customer specific equipment\n• spare parts\n• services\nRevenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation in contracts with its\ncustomers by transferring control of goods or services to the customer and it is probable that the\neconomic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.\nThe sale of equipment involves acceptance tests at AIXTRON´s production facility. After successful\ncompletion of this test, the equipment is dismantled and packaged for shipment. Revenues from\nthe sale of products that have been demonstrated to meet product specification requirements are\nrecognized at a point in time upon shipment to the customer, if full acceptance tests have been\nsuccessfully completed at the AIXTRON production facility and control has passed to the customer\nand the customer can benefit from the product either on its own or with other resources that are\nreadily available.\nUpon arrival at the customer site the equipment is reassembled and installed, which is a service\ngenerally performed by AIXTRON engineers. Revenue relating to the installation of the equipment\nis recognized at the point in time when AIXTRON has fulfilled its performance obligations under\nthe contract and control of the goods has passed to the customer.\n124\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue related to equipment where meeting the product specification requirements has not yet\nbeen demonstrated or the customer cannot benefit from the product either on its own or with\nother resources that are readily available, or where specific rights of return have been negotiated,\nis recognized only at the point in time when the customer finally accepts the equipment and has\ncontrol.\nRevenue for the sale of equipment which is built for a specific customer and does not have an\nalternative use is recognized over time based on milestones for the particular contract and the ex-\ntent to which the Group’s performance obligations have been satisfied. Typically, these contracts\nrelate to a small number of upgrades to equipment already belonging to the customer.\nRevenue related to spares is recognized at the point in time at which the customer obtains control\nof the goods, generally at the point of delivery.\nRevenue related to services is recognized either at the point in time at which the service, such\nas a repair, is delivered and the customer obtains control of the related item, or for services such\nas extended warranty, revenue is recognized over time during the period in which it is provided.\nAIXTRON gives no general rights of return, settlement discounts, credits or other sales incentives\nwithin its terms of sale.\nThe consideration from contracts which include combinations of different performance obliga-\ntions such as equipment, spares and services is allocated to each performance obligation in an\namount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in\nexchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer.\nThe Group uses a combination of methods such as an estimated cost plus margin approach, and\nallocating discounts from list price proportionately to each performance obligation when de-\ntermining the consideration for each performance obligation.\nThe portion of equipment revenue related to installation services is determined based on either\nthe fair value of the installation services or, if the Group determines that there may be a risk that\nthe economic benefits of installation services may not flow to the Group, the portion of the con-\ntract amount that is due and payable upon completion of the installation.\nFair value of the installation services is determined based on the price that would be received in\nan orderly transaction in the principal market for such equipment at the measurement date under\ncurrent market conditions.\n125\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(O) Expenses\n(I) Cost of sales\nCost of sales includes such direct costs as materials, labor and related production overheads.\n(II) Research and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of beta tools which do not qua-\nlify to be recognized as an asset are expensed as research and development costs.\nProject funding received from governments (e.g. state funding) and the European Union is recor-\nded in other operating income, if the research and development costs are incurred and provided\nthat the conditions for the funding have been met.\n(III) Lease payments\nPayments made under leases for assets which have not been capitalized are recognized as ex-\npense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(P) Government grants\nGovernment grants awarded for project funding are recorded in “Other operating income” if the\nresearch and development costs are incurred and provided that the conditions for the funding\nhave been met.\nGovernment grants awarded to support continued employment where work is not allowed are\nrecorded as a reduction in the related expense, as this presents the underlying reason for the\ngrant better.\n(Q) Tax\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits\ncan be set off against timing differences and tax losses carried forward. Deferred tax assets are\nreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit can be realized. The\nrecoverability of deferred tax assets is reviewed at least annually.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between tax and com-\nmercial balance sheets and for losses brought forward for tax purposes as well as for tax credits\nof the companies included in consolidation. The deferred taxes are calculated, based on tax rates\napplicable at the balance sheet date or known to be applicable in the future. Effects of changes\n126\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nin tax rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized upon substantively enacted\namendments to the law.\n(R) Segment reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in business activities and\nwhose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which\nAIXTRON considers to be its Executive Board, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to\nthe segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.\nAIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nAccounting standards applied in segment reporting are in accordance with the general accounting\npolicies as explained in this section.\n(S) Cash flow statement\nThe cash flow statement is prepared in accordance with IAS 7. Cash flows from operating activities\nare prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows from taxes are included in cash flows from\noperating activities.\n(T) Adoption of new and revised standardsS\nNew and amended IFRS Standards effective for the current year\nIn the current year, the Group has applied the below amendments to IFRS Standards and Inter-\npretations issued by the Board that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 Ja-\nnuary 2020. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts\nreported in these financial statements.\nInitial application of Interest Rate Bench- The Group has adopted the Interest Rate\nmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9 and Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9,\nIFRS 7 (Phase 1) IAS 39 and IFRS 7. These amendments modi-\nfy specific hedge accounting requirements.\nThe group has not had any hedge contracts\nduring the period covered by this annual\nreport and therefore the change has had no\nimpact on the Group.\n127\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInitial application of COVID-19 Related Rent In current year, the IASB issued COVID-19 Re-\nConcessions Amendment to IFRS 16 lated Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS\n16) that provides practical relief to lessees\nin accounting for rent concessions occurring\nas a direct consequence of COVID-19, by\nintroducing a practical expedient to IFRS 16.\nThe Company has had no COVID-19 related\nrent concessions and therefore it has had no\nimpact of the Group results.\nAmendments to Conceptual Framework and The Group has adopted the amendments\nto References to the Conceptual Framework for the first time in the current year. The\nin IFRS Standards amendments include consequential amend-\nments to affected Standards so that they\nrefer to the new Framework. This has had\nno impact on the Group results.\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a The Group has adopted the amendments to\nbusiness IFRS 3 for the first time in the current year.\nThe amendments clarify the definition of\na business. This has had no impact on the\nGroup results.\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of The Group has adopted the amendments to\nmaterial IAS 1 and IAS 8 for the first time in the cur-\nrent year. The amendments make the defini-\ntion of material in IAS 1 easier to understand\nand are not intended to alter the underlying\nconcept of materiality in IFRS Standards. This\nhas had no impact on the Group results.\n128\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNew and revised IFRS Standards in issue but not yet effective\nAt the date of authorization of these financial statements, the following Standards and Inter-\npretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet\neffective:\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\nIFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an\nInvestor and its Associate or Joint Venture\nAmendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or\nNon-current\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework\nAmendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds\nbefore Intended Use\nAmendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a\nContract\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of\n2018-2020 Cycle International Financial Reporting Standards,\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 16 Leases,\nand IAS 41 Agriculture\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 2)\nand IFRS 16\nAIXTRON does not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the\nfinancial statements of the Group in future periods.\n129\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3. Segment Reporting and Revenues\nIFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about compo-\nnents of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, as chief operating decision\nmaker, in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.\nIn the period 2018 to 2020 the Executive Board regularly reviewed financial information to all-\nocate resources and assess performance only on a consolidated Group basis since the various\nactivities of the Group are largely integrated from an operational perspective. In accordance with\nIFRS, AIXTRON has only one reportable segment.\nThe Group’s reportable segment is based around the category of goods and services provided to\nthe semiconductor industry.\nRevenues are recognized as disclosed in note 2 (N).\nAIXTRON values the equipment revenue deferred for equipment installation services, using a\nmarket based approach, based on observed transactions for all such contracts involving two ele-\nments where revenue has been recognized during the financial year. This is level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy described in IFRS 13. The fair value of the installation services is taken as the most\nfrequently observed (modal value) percentage of the contract price payable upon completion of\nthe installation service. For the years 2018 to 2020, 10% of the revenue related to equipment is\nallocated for installation services.\nFor contracts where equipment revenue is recognized in two elements, the same method is also\nused to determine the fair value of products delivered, which is taken to be the most frequently\nobserved (modal value) percentage of the contract value payable upon delivery of the equipment\nto the customer. This is also level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n130\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment revenues and results\nin EUR thousands Note 2020 2019 2018\nEquipment revenues 223,018 207,274 221,758\nSpares revenues 41,348 48,454 42,709\nServices revenues 4,881 3,899 4,344\nRevenue from external customers 269,247 259,627 268,811\nInventories recognized as an expense 15 113,801 106,064 129,130\nReversals of inventory provisions 15 -1,029 -646 -16,361\nObsolescence and valuation allowance expense\n15 1,918 4,627 3,018\nfor inventories\nPersonnel expense 7 66,081 60,267 55,181\nDepreciation and impairment 11 11,525 9,119 7,631\nAmortization 12 931 1,022 779\nOther expenses 53,904 51,884 52,144\nForeign exchange losses 5 1,822 834 1,946\nOther operating income 5 -14,536 -12,541 -6,123\nSegment profit 34,830 38,997 41,466\nFinance income 8 348 865 1,011\nFinance expense 8 -104 -143 -9\nProfit before tax 35,074 39,719 42,468\nReversals of impairment allowances are included in other operating income as described in\nnote 5.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segment are identical to the Group’s accounting policies\nas described in note 2.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to trans-\nfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As\nAIXTRON has only one cash generating unit (CGU), market capitalization of AIXTRON, adjusted for\na control premium, has been used to determine the fair value less cost to sell of the cash gene-\nrating unit. This is level 2 in the hierarchy of fair value measures set out in IFRS 13.\nAs at December 31, 2020 the market capitalization of AIXTRON was Euro 1,595.4 million, based on\na share price of Euro 14.27 and issued shares (excluding Treasury Shares) of 111,843,215.\nIn an orderly selling process costs are incurred. AIXTRON has used 1.5% to account for the costs\nto sell.\nA control premium typically in the range 20%-40% is incurred in the acquisition of a Company. A\n20% premium has been applied in this test to adjust the market capitalization to the fair value.\nMarket capitalization was also adjusted for net debt and tax assets prior to comparing it to the\ncarrying amount of the CGU.

Generally, the Group demands no securities for financial assets. In accordance with usual\nbusiness practice for capital equipment however, the Group mitigates its exposure to credit risk\nby requiring payment by irrevocable letters of credit and substantial payments in advance from\nmost customers as conditions of contracts for sale of major items of equipment.\nAt the balance sheet date, net trade receivables of kEUR 41,304 represent the equivalent of 18\ndays sales outstanding (2019: kEUR 29,203 30 DSO).\n147\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn 2020 three customers accounted for 16%, 11% and 10% of net trade receivables respectively.\nIn 2019 at the balance sheet date one customer accounted for 13% of net trade receivables. In\ndetermining concentrations of credit risk the Group defines counterparties as having similar cha-\nracteristics if they are connected entities.\nIncluded in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of kEUR 4,111\n(2019: kEUR 6,332) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided.\nAs there has not been a significant change in credit quality, and although the Group has no colla-\nteral, the amounts are considered recoverable.\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime\nexpected credit loss. Based on its experience, the Group uses a general provision rate for life-\ntime expected credit loss of 0%, adjusted for factors which are specific to the debtors, general\neconomic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of\nconditions at the reporting date. In determining receivables which may be individually impaired\nthe Group has taken into account the likelihood of recoverability based on the past due nature\nof certain receivables, and our assessment of the ability of all counter-parties to perform their\nobligations.\n17.

Central management of the Group assesses the counter-party risk of each finan-\ncial institution dealt with and sets limits to the Group’s exposure to those institutions. These credit\nlimits are reviewed from time to time so as to minimize the default risk as far as possible and to\nensure that concentrations of risk are managed.\nThe maximum exposure of the Group to credit risk is the total amount of receivables, financial\nassets and bank deposits as described in notes 13, 16, 17 and 18.\nFor contract assets measured at fair value, the maximum amount of the exposure to credit risk is\nthe amount of contract assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 25. There are no credit\nderivatives or similar instruments which mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk and there\nhas been no change during the period or cumulatively in the fair value of such receivables that is\nattributable to changes in the credit risk.\nMarket risks\nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange ra-\ntes and interest rate risks.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risk\nor the manner in which it manages and measures the risk except for the investment in funds in\n2020 and its associated market risks.\nForeign currency risk\nThe Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure\nto foreign currency risk, including forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk\narising on the export of equipment. The main exchange rates giving rise to the risk are those\nbetween the US Dollar, GB Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Euro.\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and mone-\ntary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:\nAssets Liabilities\nin EUR thousands 2020 2019 2020 2019\nUS Dollars 60,895 66,578 22,340 34,613\nGB Pounds 14,708 5,485 4,414 2,179\nChinese Renminbi 13,803 33,294 1,302 2,249\nExposures are reviewed on a regular basis and are managed by the Group through sensitivity\nanalysis.\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis\nThe following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% change in the value of the Euro against\nthe US Dollar, GB Pound and Chinese Renminbi.

It is cal-\nculated by revaluing the Group‘s financial assets and liabilities, existing at 31 December, deno-\nminated in US-Dollars, GB Pounds or Renminbi by 10%. It does not represent the effect of a 10%\nchange in exchange rates sustained over the whole of the financial year, only the effect of a\ndifferent rate occurring on the last day of the year.\nFair values and Contract Assets\nCash and cash equivalents, receivables are stated at amortized cost. Other financial assets in 2020\ncomprise financial assets measured at FVTPL. Contract assets are outside the scope of IFRS 9.\nContract liabilities – Advance payments\nContract liabilities for advance payments from customers occur when a contract requires the\ncustomer to pay a deposit to the Group and the deposit has actually been paid, typically near the\ncommencement of the contract. Usually, advance payments are up to 50% of the total contract\nprice.\nThe Group records the liability as the advance payment is received and eliminates the liability at\nthe same time and up to the same amount as it records revenue until the liability is fully extin-\nguished.\nThe changes in contract liabilities for advance payments in the year reflects the changing level of\noutstanding customer orders.\nTrade receivables/payables\nFor trade receivables/payables due within less than one year, measured at amortized cost, the fair\nvalue is taken to be the carrying amount.\nFinancial assets 2020\nTotal Carrying amount\nin EUR thousands At Amortized Cost At Fair Value and fair value\nCash and cash equivalents 187,259 0 187,259\nOther financial assets 0 62,422 62,422\nOther non-current financial assets 60,497 0 60,497\nTrade receivables (excluding contract assets) 38,572 0 38,572\nContract assets included in trade receivables\n0 2,732 2,732\n(not in scope of IFRS 9)\nTotal 286,328 65,154 351,482\n158\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial liabilities 2020\nTotal Carrying amount\nin EUR thousands At Amortized Cost At Fair Value and fair value\nTrade payables 10,846 0 10,846\nContract liabilities - Advance payments from\n50,824 0 50,824\ncustomers (not in scope of IFRS 7)\nLT Lease and other liabilities 2,617 0 2,617\nTotal 64,287 0 64,287\nFinancial assets 2019\nTotal Carrying amount\nin EUR thousands At Amortized Cost At Fair Value and fair value\nCash and cash equivalents 270,819 0 270,819\nOther financial assets 27,500 0 27,500\nOther non-current financial assets 446 0 446\nTrade receivables (excluding contract assets) 27,500 0 27,500\nContract assets included in trade receivables\n0 1,703 1,703\n(not in scope of IFRS 9)\nTotal 326,265 1,703 327,968\nFinancial liabilities 2019\nTotal Carrying amount\nin EUR thousands At Amortized Cost At Fair Value and fair value\nTrade payables 19,367 0 19,367\nContract liabilities - Advance payments from\n51,051 0 51,051\ncustomers (not in scope of IFRS 7)\nLT Lease and other liabilities 2,548 0 2,548\nTotal 72,966 0 72,966\n159\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of\nestimation and uncertainty\nThe preparation of AIXTRON’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make cer-\ntain estimates, judgments and assumptions that the Group believes are reasonable based upon\nthe information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and re-\nlated disclosures and are made in order to fairly present the Group’s financial position and results\nof operations. The following accounting policies are significantly impacted by these estimates and\njudgments that AIXTRON believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evalua-\nting its reported financial results:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue for the supply of most equipment to customers is generally recognized in two stages,\npartly on delivery and partly on final installation and acceptance (see note 2 (N)). The Group\nbelieves, based on past experience, that this method of recognizing revenue fairly states the re-\nvenues of the Group. The judgements made by management include an assessment of the point\nat which control has passed to the customer.\nValuation of Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This requires the Group to\nmake judgments concerning obsolescence of materials. This evaluation requires estimates, inclu-\nding both forecasted product demand and pricing environment, both of which may be susceptible\nto significant change. The carrying amount of inventories is disclosed in note 15.\nAs disclosed in notes 3 and 15, during the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Group incurred expen-\nses of kEUR 1,918, kEUR 4,627 and kEUR 3,018 respectively arising mainly from changes to past\nassumptions concerning net realizable value of inventories and excess and obsolete inventories.\nIn future periods, write-downs of inventory may be necessary due to (1) reduced demand in the\nmarkets in which the Group operates, (2) technological obsolescence due to rapid developments\nof new products and technological improvements, or (3) changes in economic or other events\nand conditions that impact the market price for the Group’s products. These factors could result\nin adjustment to the valuation of inventory in future periods, and significantly impact the Group’s\nfuture operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether the realization of future tax benefits\nis sufficiently probable to recognize deferred tax assets. This assessment requires the exercise\nof judgement on the part of management with respect to future taxable income. The recorded\namount of total deferred tax assets could be reduced if estimates of projected future taxable\nincome are lowered, or if changes in current tax regulations are enacted that impose restrictions\non the timing or extent of the Group’s ability to utilize future tax benefits. The carrying amount of\ndeferred tax assets is disclosed in note 14.\n166\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nProvisions\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. At each balance sheet date, the Group\nassesses the valuation of the liabilities which have been recorded as provisions and adjusts them\nif necessary. Because of the uncertain nature of the timing or amounts of provisions, judgement\nhas to be exercised by the Group with respect to their valuation. Actual liabilities may differ from\nthe estimated amounts. Details of provisions are shown in note 23.\nLegal proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and claims.\nThe Company, based upon advice from legal counsel, believes that the matters the Group is\naware of are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of\noperations. The Group is not aware of any unasserted claims that may have a material adverse\neffect on its financial condition or results of operation.\nCOVID-19\nEffects of COVID-19 on the business are discussed in the Management Report. The effects on the\nfinancial statements of 2020 are immaterial and it is similarly expected that the effects in 2021\nwill be immaterial.\nHerzogenrath, February 22, 2021\nAIXTRON SE\nExecutive Board\nDr. Jochen Linck Dr. Bernd Schulte Dr. Felix Grawert\n167\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nResponsibility Statement by the Executive Board\nResponsibility Statement required by §§ 297(2) sentence 4 and 315(1) sentence 5 of the Handels-\ngesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code) for the Consolidated Financial Statements: “To the\nbest of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the Consoli-\ndated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position\nand profit or loss of the Group, and the Group Management Report includes a fair review of the\ndevelopment and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a\ndescription of the material opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of\nthe Group.”\nHerzogenrath, February 22, 2021\nAIXTRON SE\nExecutive Board\nDr. Jochen Linck Dr. Bernd Schulte Dr. Felix Grawert\n168\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nTo AIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath/Germany\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAND OF THE COMBINED\nAudit Opinions\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of AIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath/Germany,\nand its subsidiaries (the Group) which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position\nas at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss, the consolidated state-\nment of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the con-\nsolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020, and\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting\npolicies. In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the parent and the\ngroup of AIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December\n2020. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the\ncorporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d German Commercial Code\n(HGB), including the further reporting on corporate governance included therein, nor the content\nof the consolidated non-financial report pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c HGB, each of which is\nreferred to in the combined management report.\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with\nthe IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law\npursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true\nand fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December\n2020 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December\n2020, and\n• the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate\nview of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this combined management\nreport is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German\nlegal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future\ndevelopment. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the\ncontent of the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB,\nincluding the further reporting on corporate governance included therein, nor the content\nof the consolidated non-financial report pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c HGB referred to\nabove.\n169\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservati-\nons relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined\nmanagement report.\nBasis for the Audit Opinions\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined manage-\nment report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; refer-\nred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted\nStandards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).\nOur responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Audi-\ntor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined\nManagement Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities\nin accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional\nlaw, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these\nrequirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation,\nwe declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU\nAudit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appro-\npriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on\nthe combined management report.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signifi-\ncance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to\n31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a\nseparate audit opinion on these matters.\nIn the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:\n1. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-element Arrangements Including Cut-off\n2. Measurement of Deferred Tax Assets\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\na) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial\nstatements)\nb) auditor’s response\n1. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-element Arrangements Including Cut-off\na) The revenue as stated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss amounts to kEUR 269,247.\n170\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nA substantial proportion of this revenue comprises the settlement of customer contracts that\ninclude multiple performance obligations. These arrangements primarily deal with the cus-\ntomer-specific manufacturing and supply of semiconductor equipment and its installation\nat the customer’s site. Furthermore, in specific cases, the Group and the customer agree on\nthe supply of related spare parts and/or the provision of services such as maintenance ser-\nvices and/or certain rights of return. These services are to be measured separately. As part of\nthe technical acceptance process with regard to the equipment, any additional services may\nbe required. These additional services also have to be considered when recognising reve-\nnue. Generally, the contract with the customer provides for a transaction price for the equip-\nment and the remaining elements such as installation, spare parts packages, services and\nspecific rights of return. Consequently, the transaction price needs to be allocated to each\nperformance obligation based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Except for cer-\ntain rights of return that exceed the common periods, the performance obligations are sa-\ntisfied at a certain point in time and the related revenue is realised. The determination of\nthe time of revenue recognition regarding arrangements comprising multiple performance\nobligations and the cut-off as part of revenue recognition are subject to the executive di-\nrectors’ judgement and assumptions due to the highly individual customer contracts and\ncomplex equipment. As a consequence, we considered this issue to be a key audit matter.\nThe information of the executive directors on revenue is provided in section 2 “Significant Ac-\ncounting Polices” in note N “Revenue” as well as in section 3 “Group Segment Information and\nRevenue” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nb) First, we recorded and assessed the major processes from order confirmation until settlement\nincluding the audit of the design, implementation and effectiveness of the accounting-re-\nlated controls regarding revenue recognition. In this context, our audit primarily covered the\neffectiveness of the controls regarding the allocation of the transaction price to the individual\nperformance obligations, the complete provision of the supply and installation services and the\nrecognition of the supplied equipment and installation services on an accrual basis.\nWe performed the following audit procedures based on a stratified and random selection of a\nsample taken from equipment supplies and installation services by means of a representative\nsampling method:\n• equipment supplies: audit of an existent customer contract, evaluation of the\nallocation of the transaction price on a relative stand-alone selling price basis to the\nindividual supply and service elements by verifying the underlying contract, reviewing\nthe time of revenue recognition pursuant to contract terms, primarily the incoterms\nbased on the acceptance test records and based on the acceptance and supply records\nof the dispatch company.\n• installation services: audit of an existent final acceptance record signed by the\ncustomer including the review of estimations made by the executive directors\nregarding work to be done yet as well as any additional agreements to the contract\nwith the customer as regards additional services to be rendered and review of the\nrelated cut-off of revenue.\n171\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n• assessment of the completeness and appropriateness of the corresponding\ninformation provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n2. Measurement of Deferred Tax Assets\na) Total deferred tax assets of kEUR 14,415 (accounting for 2.4% of the Group’s total assets) are\nstated as “Deferred tax assets” in the consolidated statement of financial position. These defer-\nred tax assets were determined based on the Group’s tax planning and mainly result from tax\nloss carry-forwards (kEUR 13,918) and deductible differences between IFRS carrying values and\ntheir tax base to be reversed in the following years (kEUR 497). The majority of the deferred tax\nassets (kEUR 12,138) results from the parent company AIXTRON SE, which has comprehensive\ntax loss carry-forwards. The executive directors are of the opinion that for the parent company\na reasonable derivation of an estimation of taxable results beyond a period of twelve months\nafter the reporting date is not possible for a technology company characterised by highly fluc-\ntuating demand and volatile results. Accordingly, deferred taxes on tax loss carry-forwards\nand temporary differences concerning the parent company AIXTRON SE were only recognised\ninsofar as they are expected to be used in 2021. The deferred tax assets concerning the parent\ncompany AIXTRON SE are measured using a tax rate of 32.8%, which is the currently applicable\nincome tax rate. The other deferred tax assets result from tax loss carry-forwards and deducti-\nble differences concerning the foreign subsidiaries of AIXTRON SE. As they are largely secured\nby cost-plus agreements with the parent company, which bears the major risks, these deferred\ntax assets are based on tax planning strategies over a period of three years using the corre-\nsponding local tax rates.\nThe result of the computation of the deferred tax assets depends on whether tax benefits\ncan be realised from tax loss carry-forwards according to estimations and assumptions of the\nexecutive directors and, therefore, are subject to uncertainties. Accordingly, we considered the\nmeasurement of deferred taxes to be a key audit matter.\nInformation on deferred taxes is provided by the executive directors of the parent company in\nnote 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nb) As part of our audit, we used the knowledge and audit results gained in previous years. For\nthe purpose of risk assessment, we obtained an understanding of the past adherence to the\nbudget. First, we assessed whether the measurement methods applied are appropriate. Ge-\nneral and industry-specific market expectations of the executive directors of AIXTRON SE were\ncompared with external sources.\nAs part of our examination of the tax matters, we consulted internal tax experts, who were\ninvolved in the audit team. They supported us in assessing the installed processes and controls\nfor validating the budget estimations and recognising tax matters. In addition, with respect to\nthe tax planning, we queried the recognition of the deferred taxes and the explanations of\nthe executive directors.

Furthermore, we obtained an\nunderstanding of the reconciliation between the expected tax expense, which was determined\nby applying the weighted group tax rate, and the recognised tax expense.\nOther Information\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the other information.

The executive direc-\ntors and the supervisory board as well are responsible for the declaration according to Section 161\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG) including the further reporting on corporate governance,\nwhich is part of the corporate governance statement, and which is referred to in the combined\nmanagement report. Apart from that, the executive directors are responsible for the other infor-\nmation.\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management\nreport do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion\nor any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above\nand, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited\ncontent of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n173\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial state-\nments that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional\nrequirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consoli-\ndated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of\nthe assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the\nexecutive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary\nto enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material miss-\ntatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for\nassessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for\nfinancial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to\nliquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined manage-\nment report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all ma-\nterial respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal\nrequirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In\naddition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems)\nas they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report\nthat is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide\nsufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the\nCombined Management Report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial state-\nments as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whet-\nher the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s\nposition and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements\nand the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an\nauditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on\nthe combined management report.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted\nin accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with Ger-\nman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut\nder Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise\n174\nAIXTRON ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nfrom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these\nconsolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\nWe also\n• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting\na material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,\nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the\noverride of internal controls.\n• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the\ncombined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate\nin the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the\neffectiveness of these systems.\n• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the\nreasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n• conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis\nof accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,\nwe are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,\nfuture events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going\nconcern.\n• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial\nstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements\npresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial\nstatements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial\nperformance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the\nadditional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of\nthe entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit\nevidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive\ndirectors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of\nthe prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit\nopinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a\nsubstantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective\ninformation.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the plan-\nned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant defi-\nciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with\nthe relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the\nrelated safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those mat-\nters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the\ncurrent period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\nOTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nReport on the Audit of the Electronic Files of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of\nthe Combined Management Report prepared for Publication pursuant to Section 317 (3b) HGB\nAudit Opinion\nIn accordance with Section 317 (3b) HGB, we have assessed with reasonable assurance whether\nthe electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management\nreport (hereafter referred to as “ESEF files”) prepared for publication, contained in the accompany-\ning file, which has the SHA-256 value 33D5CE7041BD1E9BF42737C1A476C6A94A8840E88B435B5B-\nBA3522C51E479113, meet, in all material respects, the requirements concerning the electronic\nreporting format (“ESEF format”) pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.

This is\nmainly due to the continued high demand for tools for the production of GaN power electronics\nand laser applications in particular. As expected, sales and earnings improved significantly year-\non-year in the third quarter of 2020. Thus, sales of EUR 161.1 million in the first nine months of\n2020 were also much closer to the previous year’s figure (9M/2019: EUR 184.6m) than at the\nhalf-year reporting date. The positive development of orders in the past quarter and the enquiry\nactivities of customers in the current quarter thus underline the expectations of the Management\nBoard regarding order intake, sales and earnings for the full year 2020. Accordingly, the forecast\nfor the full year 2020 has been refined and confirmed.\nAt EUR 70.8 million, order intake in the third quarter of 2020 was stable compared to the strong\nprevious quarter (EUR 69.6m). This positive development is mainly based on demand from the GaN\nand SiC power electronics and laser applications such as optical data transmission or 3D sensing.\nThe total equipment order backlog as of September 30, 2020 has increased to EUR 164.1 million.\nRevenues in the third quarter of 2020 increased as expected by 14% to EUR 64.1 million compared\nto the previous quarter (Q2/2020: EUR 56.0m). Gross profit in Q3/2020 was EUR 25.8 million\nwith a gross margin of 40% (Q2/2020: EUR 22.9m; 41%). Operating expenses in Q3/2020 were\nEUR 17.6m, below the level of the previous quarter (Q2/2020: EUR 19.6m), which was mainly\ndue to lower selling and R&D expenses in the quarter within the usual fluctuations. This led to\nan operating profit (EBIT) of EUR 8.2 million and an improved EBIT margin of 13% (Q2/2020:\nEUR 3.3m; 6%). Net income increased to EUR 7.1 million in Q3/2020 (Q2/2020: EUR 3.3m).\nFree cash flow in Q3/2020 was EUR 5.0 million (Q2/2020: EUR -11.3m).\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents, including financial assets, of EUR 292.8m as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 298.3m; June 30, 2020: EUR 288.6m). This includes\nlong-term bank deposits with a maximum maturity of 18 months amounting to EUR 30.0m. The\ncontinued high equity ratio of 82% reflects AIXTRON‘s financial strength.\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nWithin the scope of our OLED qualification project, which is operated jointly by engineers of our\ncustomer and our subsidiary APEVA, we are about to complete the qualification of the Gen2\ndeposition system and, thus, to successfully complete the Gen2 project. We will then discuss with\nthe customer about an entry into the next phase of the joint OLED development. In such a follow-\nup project, the focus would be on scaling the OVPD technology to production size in a pilot plant.\nWe continue to report no significant effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the AIXTRON Group.\nStrict safety measures are in place to ensure the safety of operations.\nAgainst the background of this and the current order backlog and market trends, we confirm our\nguidance for 2020 as follows: We expect an order intake of EUR 270m to EUR 300m (previously:\nEUR 260m to EUR 300m). We expect to generate revenues in a range between EUR 260m and\nEUR 280m (previously: EUR 260m to EUR 300m). We expect to achieve a gross margin of around\n40% and an EBIT margin of between 10% and 15% of sales in the 2020 financial year.\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group AIXTRON (“the\nAIXTRON Group” or “the Company”) can be found in the Annual Report 2019. There were no\nchanges in the first nine months of 2020. The Report is publicly available for download on the\nCompany’s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nBusiness Performance and Key Developments\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\n9M 2020 9M 2019 +/-\nm EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 209.3 150.6 58.7 39\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 164.1 108.4 55.7 51\nOrder intake in 9M/2020 increased by around 39% year-on-year to EUR 209.3 million from\nEUR 150.6 million in 9M/2019. This was driven in particular by continued strong demand from the\npower electronics, optical data communications and LED sectors. At EUR 70.8 million in Q3/2020,\norder intake was slightly above the previous quarter (Q2/2020: EUR 69.6m).\nThe equipment order backlog was EUR 164.1 million as of September 30, 2020, up 51% from\nEUR 108.4 million as of September 30, 2019.\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses denominated in\nUS dollars in the first nine months of 2020 was 1.13 USD/EUR (Q1/2020: 1.11 USD/EUR; Q2/2020:\n1.10 USD/EUR; Q3/2020: 1.17 USD/EUR). This compares to an exchange rate of 1.13 USD/EUR in\n9M/2019. Thus, compared to the previous year average, the US dollar remained stable. In Q3/2020\nAIXTRON applied an average USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.17 USD/EUR. Compared to the previous\nyear’s average exchange rate (Q3/2019: 1.12 USD/EUR), the US-Dollar depreciated by 4%, with a\ncorresponding impact of the US-Dollar-based revenues on the AIXTRON Group’s earnings.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues recorded during the first nine months of 2020 were EUR 161.1 million, a decrease\nof EUR 23.5 million or 13% compared to the same period last year (9M/2019: EUR 184.6m). This\ndevelopment was mainly a result of the scheduling of deliveries to our customers. Compared\nto the previous quarter, revenues in Q3/2020 increased by 14% to EUR 64.1 million (Q2/2020:\nEUR 56.0m). In total, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact in particular on\nthe revenues of the first half of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic first in China and later in other\nregions such as Europe and the U.S., led to the postponement of delivery and commissioning of\na few tools in the first half of the year at the request of our customers. Nevertheless, revenues\nin the first nine months of 2020 continued to be in line with our expectations for the full year.\nEquipment revenues in 9M/2020 were EUR 129.5 million, representing 80% of the total 9M/2020\nrevenues (9M/2019: 148.1m; 80%). In the third quarter of 2020, equipment revenues amounted to\nEUR 53.0m or 83% of revenues (Q3/2019: EUR 41.6m; 79%; Q2/2020: EUR 46.5m; 83%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n9M 2020 9M 2019 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 129.5 80 148.1 80 -18.6 -13\nRevenues from service, spare parts, etc. 31.7 20 36.5 20 -4.8 -13\nTotal 161.1 100 184.6 100 -23.5 -13\nRevenues by Region\n9M 2020 9M 2019 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 124.9 78 128.8 70 -3.9 -3\nEurope 20.7 13 25.6 14 -4.9 -19\nAmericas 15.6 10 30.2 16 -14.6 -48\nTotal 161.1 100 184.6 100 -23.5 -13\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n9M 2020 9M 2019 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev.\nCost of sales 97.9 61 109.8 60 -11.9 -11\nGross profit 63.3 39 74.7 40 -11.4 -15\nOperating costs 52.9 33 50.2 27 2.7 5\nSelling expenses 7.3 5 7.1 4 0.2 3\nGeneral and administration expenses 13.7 9 12.4 7 1.3 10\nResearch and development costs 41.2 26 40.0 22 1.2 3\nNet other operating (income)\n(9.3) -6 (9.4) -5 (0,0) 0\nand expenses\nGross profit in 9M/2020 was EUR 63.3 million with a gross margin of 39% (9M/2019: EUR 74.7m\nor 40%; Q3/2020: EUR 25.8m or 40%; Q2/2020: EUR 22.9m or 41%). As expected, this reflects the\nlower revenues compared with the previous year, a less favourable product mix and a weak US\nDollar, especially in the third quarter.\nOperating costs in 9M/2020 at EUR 52.9 million were slightly higher year-on-year (9M/2019:\nEUR 50.2m; Q3/2020: EUR 17.6m; Q2/2020: EUR 19.6m). This was mainly due to higher R&D\nexpenses, sales commissions as well as higher general and administration expenses driven by\nhigher recruitment costs. This was partially offset by higher other operating income due to a\npositive effect in Q1/2020 from a reversal of an impairment allowance of EUR 2.9m for one of the\ntwo production sites in Germany.\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nR&D expenses in 9M/2020 increased year-on-year to EUR 41.2 million (9M/2019: EUR 40.0m;\nQ3/2020: EUR 12.6m; Q2/2020: EUR 14.2m) and are in line with our ongoing development activities\nto bring next generation MOCVD equipment to market for various applications. Furthermore, they\nreflect the current status of the OLED project at APEVA, where the qualification of the Gen2 system\nis nearing completion and a follow-up project has not yet started.\nKey R&D Information\n9M 2020 9M 2019 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 41.2 40.0 3%\nR&D expenses, % of revenues 26 22 4pp\nNet other operating income and expenses in 9M/2020 were stable year-on-year at\nEUR 9.3 million (9M/2019: EUR 9.4m; Q3/2020: EUR 1.2m; Q2/2020: EUR 1.9m income). These are\nmainly attributable to grants for publicly funded development projects.\nOperating result (EBIT) was down year-on-year from EUR 24.5 million in 9M/2019 to\nEUR 10.3 million in 9M/2020 (Q3/2020: EUR 8.2m; Q2/2020: EUR 3.3m). This development is mainly\nthe result of the lower level of revenues year-on-year and, thus, attributable to the business\ndevelopment described above. In the third quarter of 2020, a correspondingly significant increase\nin earnings was observed.\nThe Company’s net result in 9M/2020 amounted to EUR 9.6 million (9M/2019: EUR 20.2m; Q3/2020:\nEUR 7.1m; Q2/2020: EUR 3.3m). In Q3/2020, the net result rose significantly year-on-year (Q3/2019:\nEUR 4.4m). The difference was mainly driven by the afore-mentioned volume and margin effects.\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nFinancial Position and Net Assets (Highlights)\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of September 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nTotal equity as of September 30, 2020 stood at EUR 471.4 million compared to EUR 464.1 million\nas of December 31, 2019. The equity ratio was stable at 82% as of September 30, 2020 compared\nto December 31, 2019.\nCash and cash equivalents and financial assets totaled EUR 292.8 million as of September 30,\n2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 298.3 million; June 30, 2020: EUR 288.6 million). Cash and cash\nequivalents including other financial assets decreased to EUR 262.8 million as of September 30,\n2020 compared to EUR 298.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Other financial assets included\nshort-term bank deposits of EUR 57.5 million and fund investments of EUR 27.5 million. In addition,\nAIXTRON held long-term financial assets with a maximum term of 18 months of EUR 30.0 million\nas of September 30, 2020.\nProperty, plant and equipment increased to EUR 66.9 million as of September 30, 2020\n(EUR 64.5 million as of December 31, 2019).\nGoodwill was EUR 71.2 million on September 30, 2020 compared to EUR 72.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2019. The difference was entirely related to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including components, work in progress and finished goods, increased to\nEUR 101.6 million as of September 30, 2020 from EUR 79.0 million as of December 31, 2019, which\nmainly reflects work in progress for planned tool deliveries in the last quarter of the year.\nTrade receivables decreased to EUR 19.0 million as of September 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019:\nEUR 29.2 million), which corresponds to an average DSO of 24 days (December 31, 2019: 30 days).\nThis mainly reflects the current business volumes and payment terms with customers.\nContract liabilities for advance payments received from customers amounted to\nEUR 63.2 million as of September 30, 2020 compared to EUR 51.1 million as of December 31, 2019,\nand reflect the current order backlog.\n10\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (Operating cash flow, excluding changes in financial investments – Capex +\nProceeds from disposals) in 9M/2020 amounted to EUR -3.3 million (9M/2019: EUR -2.4m; Q3/2020:\nEUR 5.0m; Q2/2020: EUR -11.3m). Following the first-time application of IFRS 16, the year-on-year\ncomparative figures for 2019 of the consolidated cash flow statement have been restated.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first nine months of 2020, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further\nsignificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2019 Annual\nReport. The COVID-19 related risks have been assessed and considered not to be significant, as it\nturned out that demand for AIXTRON products was not significantly affected by the pandemic and\nour supply chains proved to function reliably even during the lockdown.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2019 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n11\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q3/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 and the internal assessment\nof the development of demand the Executive Board again confirms and refines its 2020 full\nyear guidance. This takes into account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is so far\nconsidered to have no significant impact on the AIXTRON Group’s business.\nThe Executive Board expects an order intake of between EUR 270 million and EUR 300 million\n(previously: EUR 260m to EUR 300m). With revenues in a range between EUR 260 million and\nEUR 280 million (previously: EUR 260m to EUR 300m), Management also expects to achieve a\ngross margin of around 40% and an EBIT margin of between 10% and 15% of revenues in fiscal\nyear 2020.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing\ntrade disputes on the global economy and worldwide trade activities, in order to be able to assess\nat any time any potential effects on AIXTRON’s own supply chain and production as well as on\ncustomer demand and, thus, on the business development of AIXTRON and - if necessary - to be\nable to initiate corrective measures.\nFurther details can be found in chapter “Expected Developments” of the Annual\nReport 2019, which is publicly available for

The half-year revenues and earnings are in line\nwith expectations: H1-Revenues of EUR 97.0 million are a result of the corresponding order intake\nin the relevant prior-year period. Due to the high order intake, a significant increase in sales and\nearnings is expected in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2020. This confirms\nthe forecast for the full year 2020.\nOrder intake, of EUR 69.6 million in Q2/2020, remained stable compared to the previous quarter\n(EUR 68.8 million). This positive development is mainly based on demand from applications in the\narea of specialty LED, GaN and SiC Power Electronics as well as from optical data transmission. The\ntotal equipment backlog as of June 30, 2020 has increased to EUR 156.6 million.\nRevenues in Q2/2020 of EUR 56.0 million remained on a muted level in a year-on-year\ncomparison mainly as a result of the corresponding order intake in the relevant prior-year period,\nbut increased by 37% compared to the previous quarter (Q1/2020: EUR 41.0 million). Gross profit\nin Q2/2020 was EUR 22.9 million with a gross margin of 41% (Q1/2020: EUR 14.6 million; 36%).\nGross margin for H1/2020 of 39% has been moderately impacted by delayed final acceptances\nof MOCVD systems in Q1/2020. This was mainly due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic. At EUR 19.6 million, operating expenses in Q2/2020 were above the level of the\nprevious quarter Q1/2020 (EUR 15.7 million), which was positively influenced by a special effect.\nThis led to an operating profit (EBIT) in Q2/2020 of EUR 3.3 million and an improved EBIT margin\nof 6% (Q1/2020: EUR -1.1 million; -3%). Net income amounted to EUR 3.3 million (Q1/2020:\nEUR -0.8 million).\nFree cash flow in Q2/2020 was EUR -11.3 million (Q1/2020: EUR 3.0 million, mainly due to higher\ninventories in preparation for shipments in the second half of 2020 and an increase in receivables\ndue to a large number of deliveries at the end of the second quarter.\nAIXTRON reported cash and cash equivalents (including bank deposits with a maturity of more\nthan 90 days) of EUR 288.6 million as of June 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 298.3m; March 31,\n2020: EUR 300.8m). The continued high equity ratio of 82% reflects AIXTRON‘s financial strength.\n4\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nAIXTRON GROUP\nOur qualification project in the area of OLED deposition, jointly run by engineers from our customer\nand our subsidiary APEVA, is making further technical progress. We have achieved some critical\nspecifications and are working on the target values for as many additional ones as possible. In\nparallel we are now in discussion with our customer about the next steps to qualify for series\nproduction of the joint OLED project.\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took numerous measures at an early stage that allowed\nus to continue our business operations without significant disruption. These measures included\nworking from home for most of our staff until early June. At the same time, we introduced\ncomprehensive protection measures, so that we were able to keep our production, service and\nspare parts business fully operational at all times. This in combination with our stable supplier base,\nenabled us to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AIXTRON Group. Consequently,\nand in light of the current order backlog and market development, we can once again confirm our\nguidance for fiscal year 2020. We are pleased that since the beginning of June we have been able\nto return to normal operations with the necessary precautions, particularly in the headquarters,\nwhile continuing to apply strict protective measures for safety in operation.\n5\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON”, “the\nAIXTRON Group” or “the Group”) can be found in the Annual Report 2019. There were no changes\nin the first half of 2020. The Report is publicly available for download on the Company’s website\nat http://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nAIXTRON’s strong R&D capability remains of important strategic significance, as it provides a\ncompetitive, leading edge technology portfolio and supports the future business development.\nAIXTRON is committed to investing specifically in research and development projects to retain\nor to expand the Company’s leading technology position in MOCVD equipment for applications\nsuch as lasers, specialty LEDs and for the production of wide-band-gap materials for power\nelectronics. AIXTRON is also investing in the OVPD technology of its subsidiary APEVA. All R&D\nexpenditures are monitored very closely.\nIn one of the many research projects we are currently working on, a major milestone was reached\nin the first half of 2020 after 18 months of project duration in the form of a pilot tool that is now\navailable. The BMBF-funded “GIMMIK” project, mentioned as an example, is concerned with the\nproduction and application of graphene in industrial semiconductor production. The prerequisite\nfor this is a high and reliably reproducible quality of the functional materials. Together with the\nproject partners, the understanding of the technology and the optimization of the layer properties\nwill now be improved.\nEnvironmental protection and the responsible use of resources are also essential parts of\nAIXTRON’s business strategy. The Group’s engineers are working to continuously improve AIXTRON\nequipment both in terms of resource-saving design and environmentally friendly operation.\nThe energy efficiency and yield of the chemicals used in the operation of the equipment is an\nimportant element in this strategy. Further information can be found in our Sustainability Report\n(CSR Report) 2019 on the AIXTRON website at www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n6\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nEconomic Report\nMacroeconomic developments\nThe global economy is in a severe recession. After a modestly positive start to the year 2020, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic quickly became the dominant factor for economic development in the first\nhalf of 2020 in many industries. The global outbreak of the virus and the often drastic measures\ntaken to contain it have led to severe distortions in both sales and procurement markets and in\ninternational supply chains. The individual countries were confronted with a complex crisis. This\nis also reflected in the forecast of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic\nOutlook of June 2020. The main burden of the economic downturn lies in the second quarter\nand thus also in the first half of the year. However, the forecast is subject to considerable\nuncertainty. For 2020 as a whole, the IMF expects global economic output to slump by -4.9% (-1.9\npercentage points compared with April 2020) after 2.9% growth in 2019. The expected growth\nrate for the industrialized nations is -8.0% (2019: +1.7%), while the growth rate for the emerging\nand developing countries is expected to be -3.0% (2019: +3.7%). World trade is expected to\nshrink by 11.9%. The situation in the strongly export-oriented German mechanical and equipment\nengineering industry is similar. According to reports of the German Engineering Federation\nVerband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau e.V. (VDMA), after a positive start to the year and\na 7% increase in orders in January 2020 , the first five months of the year have now seen a 13%\ndecline in orders received.\nThe AIXTRON Group’s business development was only moderately impacted by the deterioration\nof the general global economic environment in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. Demand for AIXTRON products is largely dependent on industry-specific developments,\nsuch as the introduction of new applications in the consumer electronics industry or demand in\nsub-segments of the global semiconductor market, which overall remained stable. Like most\ntechnology hardware companies, AIXTRON has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak well\nin the first half of 2020 and was able to maintain operations complying with strict measures.\n7\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIndustry developments\nLasers that can be produced on AIXTRON systems have a wide range of applications in the fields\nof 3D sensor technology and optical data transmission: According to the market research\ncompany Yole Développement, consumer electronics will be the main driver of demand for\nlasers in 3D sensor technology in the coming years. The market for lasers for ultra-fast optical\ndata transmission will be influenced in particular by the increasing use of cloud computing and\nInternet services such as video on demand and music streaming as well as by the communication\nof networked devices via the Internet (“Internet of Things”).\nIn addition, the power electronics sector is a significant growth market for AIXTRON: Power\nsemiconductors based on Wide-Band-Gap (WBG) materials enable the production of very\ncompact and highly efficient AC-DC and DC-DC converters, which are used in a wide range of\napplications. These range from low power (e.g. power supply of smart phones) to high power\n(e.g. fast charging station for electric vehicles). Power components made of the materials silicon\ncarbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) are gaining market share in the overall market for\npower components at an increasing rate.\nIn the optoelectronics sector, the micro LEDs segment represents the greatest growth potential\naccording to LEDinside. Large area displays and displays in various end applications such as\nsmartphones, tablets, smart watches and notebooks are considered potential drivers. According\nto Yole, the market for red, orange and yellow LEDs (ROY LEDs) is also predicted to continue\ngrowing due to the worldwide use of direct emitting, large area LED display walls or backlighting\nunits.\nThe growth forecasts for the market segments described here in detail are listed in the economic\nreport of our Annual Report 2019. We consider these forecasts to remain valid due to the reduced\nimpact of the pandemic on AIXTRON’s markets.\nBased on the published financial results of competitors and AIXTRON’s own estimates, AIXTRON saw\nits global market leadership for MOCVD equipment confirmed in 2019. For the fourth consecutive\nyear, AIXTRON has taken the top position: AIXTRON’s market share was 56%, followed by AMEC\n(China) with 25% and Veeco (USA) with 14%. At the same time, the global market for MOCVD\nequipment in 2019 was flat year on year, at a total of USD 524m (2018: USD 553m).\n8\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nResults of Operations\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\nH1 2020 H1 2019 +/-\nm EUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 138.4 98.3 40.1 41\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 156.6 110.1 46.5 42\nOrder intake in H1/2020 increased by around 41% year-on-year to EUR 138.4 million from\nEUR 98.3 million in H1/2019. This was driven in particular by continued strong demand from the\npower electronics, optical data communications and LED sectors. At EUR 69.6m in Q2/2020, order\nintake was slightly above the previous quarter (Q1/2020: EUR 68.8m). Due to internal regulations,\nthis is mainly driven by demand from the power electronics and optical data communication\nindustries. For reasons of comparability, the US dollar-based equipment order intake and the\nequipment order backlog received in fiscal year 2020 were translated at the internally determined\nannual budget rate of 1.20 USD/EUR (2019: USD/EUR 1.20).\nThe equipment order backlog of EUR 156.6m as of June 30, 2020 was also above the level of\nboth the previous year (H1/2019: EUR 110.1m) and the previous quarter (Q1/2020: EUR 146.3m).\nThe majority of the backlog is expected to be convertible into revenues in 2020.\nIn line with a strict internal process, AIXTRON has defined clear conditions that must be met for\nthe recording of equipment orders in order intake and order backlog. These conditions include the\nfollowing requirements:\n• the receipt of a firm written purchase order,\n• the receipt of an agreed down payment,\n• accessibility to the required shipping documentation,\n• the customer confirmed agreement on a system specific delivery date.\n9\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nIn addition, and taking into account current market conditions, the Management Board reserves\nthe right to assess whether the actual realization of each system order is sufficiently likely to\noccur in a timely manner. If, as a result of this review, Management comes to the conclusion that\nthe realization of an order is not sufficiently likely or involves an unacceptable degree of risk,\nManagement will exclude this specific order or a portion of this order from the recorded order\nintake and order backlog figures until the risk has decreased to an acceptable level. The order\nbacklog is regularly assessed and - if necessary - adjusted in line with potential execution risks.\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses denominated in\nUS dollars in the first six months of 2020 was 1.11 USD/EUR (Q1/2020: 1.11 USD/EUR; Q2/2020: 1.10\nUSD/EUR), which compares to 1.13 USD/EUR in H1/2019. Thus, compared to the same period of the\nprevious year, the average US dollar strengthened slightly in H1/2020, increasing the Euro value\nof US dollar denominated revenues in this period.\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues recorded during the first half-year of 2020 were EUR 97.0 million, a decrease\nof EUR 35.0 million or 27% compared to the same period last year (H1/2019: EUR 132.0m). This\nexpected development was mainly a result of the corresponding order intake in the relevant prior-\nyear period, now being reflected in revenues upon delivery of the tools. Compared to the first\nquarter of 2020, revenues in Q2/2020 increased by 37% to EUR 56.0 million (Q1/2020: EUR 41.0m).\nIn total, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on half-year revenues. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic first in China and later in other regions such as Europe and the U.S., led to the\npostponement of delivery and commissioning of a few tools in the first half of the year at the\nrequest of our customers. Overall, however, revenues were fully in line with our expectations for\nthe full year.\nEquipment revenues in H1/2020 were EUR 76.4 million, representing 79% of the total H1/2020\nrevenues (H1/2019: 106.5m; 81%). In the second quarter 2020, equipment revenues amounted\nto EUR 46.5 million or 83% of revenues (Q2/2019: EUR 50.3m; 79%; Q1/2020: EUR 29.9m; 73%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nThe deposition equipment and upgrades bought by AIXTRON’s customers in the first half-year\n2020 are used for the manufacture of specialty LEDS, GaN and SiC Power Electronics and Lasers\nfor optical data communication.\n10\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\nH1 2020 H1 2019 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 76.4 79 106.5 81 -30.1 -28\nRevenues from service, spare parts, etc. 20.6 21 25.5 19 -4.9 -19\nTotal 97.0 100 132.0 100 -35.0 -27\nRevenues by Region\nH1 2020 H1 2019 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 74.0 76 99.7 76 -25.7 -26\nEurope 10.3 11 15.7 12 -5.4 -34\nAmericas 12.8 13 16.6 13 -3.8 -23\nTotal 97.0 100 132.0 100 -35.0 -27\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\nH1 2020 H1 2019 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev.\nCost of sales 59.5 61 79.4 60 -19.9 -25\nGross profit 37.5 39 52.6 40 -15.1 -29\nOperating costs 35.3 36 33.5 25 1.8 5\nSelling expenses 5.4 6 4.7 4 0.7 16\nGeneral and administration expenses 9.3 10 8.1 6 1.2 15\nResearch and development costs 28.6 30 25.3 19 3.3 13\nNet other operating (income)\n(8.1) -8 (4.6) -4 3.5 75\nand Expenses\nGross profit in H1/2020 was EUR 37.5 million with a gross margin of 39% (H1/2019: EUR 52.6m\nor 40%; Q2/2020: EUR 22.9m or 41%; Q1/2020: EUR 14.6m or 36%). This reflects the expected\nlower revenues compared with the previous year, the costs of underutilization in production and\nservice, as well as the postponement of the commissioning of some few tools at customers. The\nimproved product mix with higher margins and the strong US Dollar could not fully offset these\neffects.\n11\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOperating costs in H1/2020 at EUR 35.3m were slightly higher year-on-year (H1/2019: EUR 33.5m;\nQ2/2020: EUR 19.6m; Q1/2020: EUR 15.7m). This was mainly due to higher R&D expenses, sales\ncommissions as well as higher general and administration expenses driven by higher recruitment\ncosts and additional IT to enable large-scale home office work. This was partially offset by higher\nother operating income due to a positive effect in Q1/2020 from a reversal of an impairment\nallowance of EUR 2.9m.\nR&D expenses in H1/2020 increased by EUR 3.3m year-on-year to EUR 28.6m (H1/2019: EUR 25.3m;\nQ2/2020: EUR 14.2m; Q1/2020: EUR 14.4m) and are in line with our ongoing research activities\nto develop next generation MOCVD equipment for different applications and to advance the\nqualification of our OLED technology.\nKey R&D Information\nH1 2020 H1 2019 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 28.6 25.3 13\nR&D expenses, % of sales 30 19\nNet other operating income and expenses in H1/2020 was an income of EUR 8.1m (H1/2019:\nEUR 4.6m; Q2/2020: EUR 1.9m; Q1/2020: EUR 6.2m income). The net income in H1/2020 was\nmainly attributable to the above-mentioned effect from the reversal of an impairment as well as\nR&D grants of EUR 3.9m and exchange rate gains of EUR 0.9m.\nOperating result (EBIT) was down year-on-year from EUR 19.1m in H1/2019 to EUR 2.2m in\nH1/2020 (Q2/2020: EUR 3.3m; Q1/2020: EUR -1.1m). This development is mainly the result of the\nlower level of revenues with a slightly lower gross margin and, thus, attributable to the business\nand cost development described above.\nThe result before taxes in H1/2020 was EUR 2.4m (H1/2019: EUR 19.5m; Q2/2020: EUR 3.3m;\nQ1/2020 EUR -0.9m).\nTax income in H1/2020 amounted to EUR 0.1m (tax expenses H1/2019: EUR 3.7m; Q2/2020:\nEUR 0.0m; tax credit Q1/2020: EUR 0.1m), which resulted primarily from the reversal of tax\nvaluation differences existing in previous periods.\nThe Company’s net result in H1/2020 amounted to EUR 2.5m (H1/2019: EUR 15.8m; Q2/2020:\nEUR 3.3m; Q1/2020: EUR -0.8m). The difference was mainly driven by the afore-mentioned volume\nand margin effects.\n12\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Position and Net Assets\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nTotal equity as of June 30, 2020 remained nearly unchanged at EUR 465.1m compared to\nEUR 464.1m as of December 31, 2019 mainly due to the period’s net result. The equity ratio was\nstable at 82% as of June 30, 2020 (82% as of December 31, 2019).\nThe AIXTRON Group’s capital expenditures for the first six months of 2020 amounted to EUR 5.2m\n(H1/2019: EUR 6.7m), of which EUR 4.2m (H1/2019: EUR 5.9m) related to property, plant and\nequipment (including testing and laboratory equipment as well as tools under development and\nleased buildings).\nCash and cash equivalents (including cash deposits with a maturity of more than three months)\ndecreased to EUR 288.6m as of June 30, 2020 compared to EUR 298.3m as of December 31, 2019.\nThe difference reflecting a build-up of Inventories, not fully offset by higher advance payments of\ncustomers during the first half-year of 2020.\nProperty, plant and equipment increased to EUR 66.6m as of June 30, 2020 (EUR 64.5 million as\nof December 31, 2019).\nGoodwill was EUR 71.7m at June 30, 2020 compared to EUR 72.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nThere were no impairment requirements in the first six months of 2020. The difference was\nrelated to exchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, unfinished and finished goods, increased to EUR 91.2m as of\nJune 30, 2020 from EUR 79.0 million as of December 31, 2019, which mainly reflects stocking for a\nscheduled increase of production volumes in the second half of the year as well as a safety stock\nof certain material in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTrade receivables decreased to EUR 23.8m as of June 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 29.2m),\nwhich corresponds to an average DSO of 30 days (December 31, 2019: 30 days). This mainly\nreflects the current business volumes.\nContract liabilities for advance payments received from customers amounted to EUR 61.1m\nas of June 30, 2020 compared to EUR 51.1 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting the current\norder backlog.\n13\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nINTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (Operating cash flow – Capex + proceeds from disposals) in H1/2020 amounted\nto EUR -8.4m (H1/ 2019: EUR -4.8m; Q2/2020: EUR -11.3m; Q1/2020: EUR 3.0m). Following the\nfirst-time application of IFRS 16, the year-on-year comparative figures of the consolidated cash\nflow statement have been restated. The negative free cash flow in H1/2020 was mainly due to\nthe increase of inventories, which was only partially offset by higher advance payments received\nfrom customers.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first six months of 2020, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further significant\nadditions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2019 Annual Report. The\nCOVID-19 related risks have been assessed considered not to be significant, as it turned out that\ndemand for AIXTRON products was not significantly affected by the pandemic and our supply\nchains proved to function reliably even during the lockdown.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2019 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nIn particular, AIXTRON expects the following market trends and opportunities in the relevant end\nuser markets could possibly have a positive effect on future business:\nShort Term\n• Increasing adoption of compound semiconductor-based lasers for 3D sensor systems in\nmobile devices as well as sensors for infrastructure applications.\n• Further increasing demand for lasers for ultra-fast optical data transmission of large\nvolumes, such as for video streaming and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.\n• Increasing use of LEDs and specialty LEDs (esp. red-orange-yellow, UV or IR) for displays,\ndisinfection and other applications.\n• Increasing use of wide-band-gap GaN- or SiC-based components for energy-efficient power\nelectronics devices in autos, in consumer electronics, in mobile devices and in\nIT infrastructure.\n• Progress in the development of OLED displays that require an efficient deposition\ntechnology.\n14\nAIXTRON 2020 HALF-YEAR GROUP FINANCIAL REPORT\nADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES\nMid- to Long-Term\n• Development of new applications based on wide-band-gap materials such as high-\nfrequency chips or system-on-chip architectures with integrated power management.\n• Increased use of compound semiconductor-based sensors for autonomous driving.\n• Increased development activities for high performance solar cells made of compound\nsemiconductor.\n• Development of new materials with the help of carbon nanostructures\n(carbon nanotubes, -wires and graphene).\n• Development of alternative LED applications, such as visual-light communication\ntechnology or Micro LED displays.\nOutlook\nBased on the results for the first six months of fiscal year 2020 and the internal assessment of\nthe development of demand the Executive Board confirms its 2020 full year guidance. This\ntakes into account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently considered to have\nno significant impact on the AIXTRON Group’s business.\nCompared to the previous year, Management expects an increasing order development and an\noverall stable to slightly increasing sales development for fiscal year 2020. The Executive Board\nexpects an order intake of between EUR 260 million and EUR 300 million. With revenues in a\nrange between EUR 260 million and EUR 300 million, Management also expects to achieve a\ngross margin of around 40% and an EBIT margin of between 10% and 15% of revenues in fiscal\nyear 2020.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global\neconomy and worldwide trade activities, in order to be able to assess at any time any potential\neffects on AIXTRON’s own supply chain and production as well as on customer demand and, thus,\non the business development of AIXTRON and - if necessary - to be able to initiate corrective\nmeasures.\nFurther details can be found in chapter “Expected Developments“ of the Annual\nReport 2019, which is publicly available for download on the Company‘s website

Due to the pandemic, only a\nfew shipments to China were postponed to the coming quarter as a result of customers‘ delaying\nproduction infrastructure plans. Furthermore, travel restrictions led to the postponement of the\ncommissioning of some AIXTRON tools into the following quarter, especially in China. However,\nAIXTRON‘s operations and production continued without interruption.\nOrder intake in Q1/2020 increased year-on-year by 28%, from EUR 53.6 million to EUR 68.8 million,\ndriven by the continued strong demand for our systems despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This\npositive development is based on further market growth for lasers for optical data transmission\nand 3D sensor technology especially in mobile phones, an increasing use of LED-based display\napplications, a progressive expansion of the 5G network and an increasing use of energy-efficient\npower electronics.\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 300.8 million as of March 31, 2020. The continued\nhigh equity ratio of 82% reflects AIXTRON’s financial strength.\nFrom today‘s perspective, we do not consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nAIXTRON Group‘s business as significant, and therefore, confirm our guidance for fiscal year 2020,\nin light of the current order backlog and market development.\n4\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nAIXTRON GROUP\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nBusiness Activity and Strategy\nA detailed overview of the business activities and strategy of the AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON” or\n“the Group”) can be found in the Annual Report 2019. There were no changes in the first three\nmonths of 2020. The Report is publicly available for download on the Company’s website at\nhttp://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\nBusiness Performance and Key Developments\nDevelopment of Orders\nOrders\n(in EUR million)\n2020 2019\n+/-\nQ1 Q1\nmEUR %\nTotal order intake incl. spares & services 68.8 53.6 15.2 28\nEquipment order backlog (end of Period) 146.3 125.7 20.6 16\nOrder intake in Q1/2020 increased by around 28% year-on-year to EUR 68.8 million due to\ncontinuing high level of demand across all business areas. Compared to the very strong orders\nreceived in Q4/2019, orders in Q1/2020 were, as expected, lower than in the previous quarter\n(Q1/2019: EUR 53.6 million; Q4/2019: EUR 81.4 million).\nThe equipment order backlog as of March 31, 2020 increased to EUR 146.3 million (31.12.2019:\nEUR 116.7 million).\nExchange Rate Development of the US Dollar\nThe average exchange rate used by AIXTRON to translate income and expenses denominated\nin US dollars in the first three months of 2020 was 1.11 USD/EUR (Q1/2019: 1.14 USD/EUR). Thus,\ncompared to the previous year average, the US dollar was 3% stronger having a positive effect\non US dollar denominated revenues and earnings in the first quarter. Compared to the previous\nquarter, the average US dollar exchange rate was stable in Q1/2020 (Q4/2019: 1.10 USD/EUR).\n5\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Revenues\nTotal revenues recorded during the first quarter of 2020 were EUR 41.0 million, lower than the\nsame period last year and the previous quarter (Q1/2019: EUR 68.7 million; Q4/2019: EUR 75.1\nmillion). This expected development was mainly due to low order intake in Q2 and Q3 of 2019,\nnow being reflected in revenues upon delivery of the tools. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhad only a limited impact on first quarter revenues. In particular the COVID-19 related restrictions\nin China as well as travel restrictions meant that a few deliveries to China and the commissioning\nof tools were postponed at the request of our customers. Overall, however, revenues are fully in\nline with expectations for the full year.\nEquipment revenues in Q1/2020 were EUR 29.9 million and accounted for 73% of total Q1/2020\nrevenues (Q1/2019: EUR 56.1 million or 82%; Q4/2019: EUR 59.2 million or 79%).\nThe remaining revenues were generated from the sale of spare parts and services.\nRevenues by Equipment, Spares & Service\n(in EUR million)\n2020 2019\nQ1 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nEquipment revenues 29.9 73 56.1 82 -26.2 -47\nRevenues from service, spare parts, etc. 11.0 27 12.5 18 -1.5 -12\nTotal 41.0 100 68.7 100 -27.7 -40\nRevenues by Region\n2020 2019\nQ1 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % m EUR % m EUR %\nAsia 26.3 64 56.7 83 -30.4 -54\nEurope 7.1 17 5.4 8 1.7 31\nAmericas 7.5 18 6.5 9 1.0 15\nTotal 41.0 100 68.7 100 -27.7 -40\n6\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nDevelopment of Results\nCost Structure\n2020 2019\nQ1 Q1 +/-\nm EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev. m EUR % Rev.\nCost of sales 26.4 64 42.0 61 -15.6 -37\nGross profit 14.6 36 26.7 39 -12.1 -45\nOperating costs 15.7 38 17.0 25 -1.2 -7\nSelling expenses 2.7 7 2.3 3 0.4 17\nGeneral and administration expenses 4.8 12 3.8 6 1.0 26\nResearch and development costs 14.4 35 12.8 19 1.6 13\nNet other operating (income)\n(6.2) -15 (1.9) -3 4.2 223\nand Expenses\nGross profit in Q1/2020 was EUR 14.6 million with a gross margin of 36% (Q1/2019: EUR 26.7\nmillion or 39%; Q4/2019: EUR 34.0 million or 45%). This reflects the expected lower revenues\ncompared with the previous year as well as the postponement of the commissioning of some\ntools, especially at our Chinese customers.\nOperating costs in Q1/2020 at EUR 15.7 million were lower year-on-year and compared to the\nprevious quarter (Q1/2019: EUR 17.0 million; Q4/2019: EUR 19.6 million). The difference is mainly in\nother operating income. A change in the planned use of one of the German production facilities\nresulted in a reversal of an impairment allowance of EUR 2.9 million. This was partly offset by\nhigher R&D costs and increased general and administrative expenses, which were due to\nhigher recruitment costs and additional IT to enable large-scale home office work.\nR&D expenses in Q1/2020 were EUR 14.4 million (Q1/2019: 12,8 million; Q4/2019: EUR 15.0 million)\nand are in line with our ongoing research activities to develop next generation MOCVD equipment\nfor different applications and to advance the qualification of our OLED technology.\nKey R&D Information\n2020 2019\nQ1 Q1 +/-\nR&D expenses (million EUR) 14.4 12.8 13%\nR&D expenses, % of sales 35 19 16pp\nNet other operating income and expenses in Q1/2020 was an income of EUR 6.2 million\n(Q1/2019: EUR 1.9 million; Q4/2019: EUR 2.3 million income). The net income in Q1/2020 was\nmainly attributable to the above mentioned effect from the reversal of an impairment as well as\nR&D grants of EUR 1.9 million and exchange rate gains of EUR 1.2 million.\n7\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOperating result (EBIT) was down year-on-year from EUR 9.7 million in Q1/2019 to EUR -1.1\nmillion in Q1/2020 (Q1/2020: EUR 9.7 million; Q4/2019: EUR 14.4 million). This development is\nmainly the result of the low level of revenues and gross margin and, thus, attributable to the\nbusiness and cost development described above.\nThe Company’s net result in Q1/2020 amounted to EUR -0.8 million (Q1/2019: EUR 8.5 million;\nQ4/2019: EUR 12.2 million). The difference was mainly driven by volume and margin effects.\nFinancial Position and Net Assets (Highlights)\nThe Company did not have any bank borrowings as of March 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nTotal equity as of March 31, 2020 decreased to EUR 462.9 million compared to EUR 464.1 million\nas of December 31, 2019 mainly due to the period’s net result. The equity ratio was 82% as of\nMarch 31, 2020 (82% as of December 31, 2019).\nCash and cash equivalents (including cash deposits with a maturity of more than three months)\nincreased to EUR 300.8 million as of March 31, 2020 compared to EUR 298.3 million as of December\n31, 2019. The difference reflecting increased advance payments by customers and the collection\nof receivables during the quarter.\nProperty, plant and equipment increased to EUR 65.9 million as of March 31, 2020 (EUR 64.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2019).\nGoodwill was EUR 72.2 million at March 31, 2020 compared to EUR 72.4 million at December 31,\n2019. There were no impairments in the first three months of 2020. The difference was related to\nexchange rate fluctuations.\nInventories, including raw materials, unfinished and finished goods, increased to EUR 85.2 million\nas of March 31, 2020 from EUR 79.0 million as of December 31, 2019, which mainly reflects a safety\nstock of certain material in light of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as stocking for a scheduled\nincrease of production volumes in the course of the year.\nTrade receivables decreased to EUR 17.1 million as of March 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR\n29.2 million), which again corresponds to an average DSO of 30 days (December 31, 2019: 30\ndays). This mainly reflects the current business volumes.\nContract liabilities for advance payments received from customers amounted to EUR 60.2\nmillion as of March 31, 2020 compared to EUR 51.1 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting the\ncurrent order backlog.\n8\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (Operating cash flow – Capex + proceeds from disposals) in Q1/2020 amounted\nto EUR 3.0 million (Q1/2019: EUR -17.5 million; Q4/2019: EUR 37.6 million). Following the first-time\napplication of IFRS 16, the comparative figures of the consolidated cash flow statement for Q1\nand Q4 2019 have been restated. The positive free cash flow in Q1/2020 was mainly due to the\ncollection of receivables and higher advance payments received by customers partially offset by\nthe reduction of trade payables and the increase of inventories.\nOpportunities and Risks\nDuring the first three months of 2020, AIXTRON Management was not aware of any further\nsignificant additions or changes in the Opportunities and Risks as described in the 2019 Annual\nReport. The COVID-19 related risks have been assessed considered not to be significant.\nA description of the opportunities and risks of the AIXTRON Group can be found in the chapters\n“Risk Report” and “Opportunities Report“ of the Annual Report 2019 which is publicly available\nfor download on the Company‘s website at https://www.aixtron.com/en/investors/publications.\n9\nAIXTRON QUARTERLY GROUP STATEMENT Q1/2020\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOutlook\nBased on the results for the first three months of fiscal year 2020 and the internal assessment of\nthe development of demand the Executive Board confirms its 2020 full year guidance. This\ntakes into account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently considered to have\nno significant impact on the AIXTRON Group’s business.\nCompared to the previous year, Management expects an increasing order development and an\noverall stable to slightly increasing sales development for fiscal year 2020. The Executive Board\nexpects an order intake of between EUR 260 million and EUR 300 million. With revenues in a\nrange between EUR 260 million and EUR 300 million, Management also expects to achieve a\ngross margin of around 40% and an EBIT margin of between 10% and 15% of revenues in fiscal\nyear 2020.\nThe Executive Board will continuously monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global\neconomy and worldwide trade activities, in order to be able to assess at any time any potential\neffects on AIXTRON’s own supply chain and production as well as on customer demand and, thus,\non the business development of AIXTRON and - if necessary - to be able to initiate corrective\nmeasures.\nFurther details can be found in chapter “Expected Developments “ of the Annual Report 2019,\nwhich is publicly available for download on the Company‘s website at

To stop it, we need joint and\ncoordinated efforts from all stakeholders. This is the only way we can sustainably secure\nthe future of future generations.\nBusiness, science and academic research are important pillars and drivers of change. They\nmust develop and offer sustainable innovations that replace fossil fuels. Industry should\nseize this opportunity, invest in sustainable technologies and align their business and\noperating processes ecologically. Because we have a great responsibility for the societies\nin which we operate and for the global community.\nAt AIXTRON we are aware of this responsibility and act accordingly. The topic of\nsustainability has two aspects for us: On the one hand, we operate energy-efficiently and\nclimate-neutrally1 at our locations. On the other hand, we use our systems to promote\nthe spread of particularly energy-efficient technologies and research even more\nsustainable solutions for the future.\nThis strategy is bearing fruit and is paying off on several levels:\n• The year 2023 was economically very successful for AIXTRON. We achieved sales of EUR\n630 million, of which 73% were taxonomy-aligned (2022: 58%). This corresponds to\nsales revenue of EUR 462 million, which was ecologically sustainable in the sense of the\nEU taxonomy (2022: EUR 271 million).\n• We have launched our new G10 product family with G10-SiC, G10-AsP and G10-GaN,\ncovering the entire spectrum in power electronics and optoelectronics. This means we\nare once again significantly increasing the key performance indicators for the\nproduction of particularly energy-efficient applications such as e-mobility, data\ntransmission, renewable energy and Micro LED displays. The response from our\ncustomers shows that we have hit the nerve of the times with our technologies.\n• We have started with the construction of our new innovation center, in which we are\ninvesting around EUR 100 million. Once finished, we will continue to expand our own\nresearch & development activities and work together with our suppliers and customers\non the sustainable innovations of tomorrow.\n• We have continued to align our operating and investment expenditure sustainably in\naccordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The share of taxonomy-aligned\noperating expenses (OpEX) was 65% and our share of taxonomy-aligned capital\nexpenditures (CapEx) was 79%.\n• We maintained our high level in the MSCI rating with AA (2022: AA).\nWe are not only responsible for greater sustainability and society in general, but also, first\nand foremost, for our workforce. It forms the backbone of our success and our innovative\nstrength in all areas.

In\ncase of discrepancies, the German language document shall prevail and shall be the valid\nversion.\n8\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nForeword\nΩ Framework and Reporting\nThe sustainability report is prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting\nStandards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The table at the end of the report\nprovides information on the assignment of the content to the requirements of the GRI\nframework. On our AIXTRON website under the menu item \"Sustainability,\" you will find\naccompanying explanations of the information and projects presented in this report.\nWith the report, we primarily want to give our interest groups (stakeholders) the most\ncomprehensive possible picture of the non-financial aspects and key figures of our\nbusiness activities. Individual key figures were recorded for the first time in the 2023\nreporting year and included in this report. If in individual cases, we do not have any data\nfrom previous years, it is not possible to compare these key figures with previous years. In\nthis case, this is indicated by a corresponding note.\nThe requirements of the German CSR Directive Implementation Act oblige AIXTRON to\npublish a non-financial statement. With our separate non-financial report, we meet the\nrequirements that arise for us from Section 315b (1-3) HGB.\nAll sections of text, tables, and graphics in the sustainability report that are assigned to\nthe non-financial report are marked with an omega symbol Ω. Therefore, not all\ninformation contained in this report is also a mandatory part of the separate non-\nfinancial statement. References to information in the management report are part of the\nnon-financial statement.\nAccording to Section 289c (3) HGB, we are obliged to examine topics for their “double\nmateriality”. Dual materiality requires disclosures on non-financial aspects to be made as\nsoon as the following criteria are met:\n1. The information is necessary to understand the course of business, the business result,\nand the position of the company.\n2. The information makes it possible to understand how the company's business activities\naffect non-financial aspects.\nWe checked the issues identified for this double materiality. The topics that fit this\ndefinition are also marked in the report by an omega sign Ω. These topics are assigned to\nthe respective chapters in this report. In terms of Sections 289c Paragraphs 2 and 3, 315c\nHGB, no “material risks” have been identified either with regard to our business activities\nor with regard to our business relationships, products, and services that have or will have\n“very likely serious negative effects”.\nThe non-financial information and key figures on our sustainability activities given in this\nreport were subjected to an independent review with “limited assurance” by KPMG AG\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Duesseldorf (Germany) using the relevant auditing\nstandards for sustainability reporting (ISAE 3000 Revised).\n9\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nForeword\nΩ Dialogue with our stakeholders\nWe maintain trusting and long-term partnerships with our stakeholders. In doing so, it is\nimportant to us - just as in our company to each other - that we treat each other in a\nspirit of partnership, respectful and constructive. We see ourselves as part of this society.\nThat is why we are committed to community and social projects – particularly in the\nregion where our headquarters are located.\nThe key interest groups for AIXTRON are:\n• Customers • State and politics\n• Employees • Media\n• Capital market participants • Science and Research\n• Delivery\nThe identification of the most important stakeholders and their interests are crucial for a\nsuccessful stakeholder dialogue (see also the chapter on sustainable corporate\nmanagement and sustainability strategy / materiality analysis). The interest groups were\ncategorized and prioritized based on the following criteria:\n• Interests of the stakeholders\n• Stakeholder Influence\n• Stakeholder expectations of AIXTRON\n• Dependence of stakeholders on AIXTRON\n• Value for AIXTRON to get in touch with this stakeholder\nWe regularly reflect on the process for identifying the most important stakeholders and\nthe relevant topics and adjust them where necessary.\n10\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nForeword\nStakeholder Topics of dialog Forms of dialog\nCapital market • Business performance • Sustainability • Roadshows and • Annual General\n• Product innovations • Strategy (telephone) Meeting\n• Application conferences • Sustainability\npossibilities • Quarterly reporting reporting\n• Annual financial • Company visits\nstatements and\nannual report\nCustomers • Product quality and • Human rights • Audits • Product requirements\nsafety • Compliance • Expert support • Joint developments\n• Sustainable • AIXTRON after-sales with customers\ntechnologies • Fairs and conferences\n• Product energy\nefficiency\nSuppliers and • Product quality and • Responsible • Supplier evaluation • Workshops\nbusiness safety purchasing • Purchasing principles • Audits\n• Environmental • Compliance with\npartners\nprotection AIXTRON’s standards\nEmployees • Health and safety • Compensation and • Intranet • Employee survey\n• Career advancement benefits • Staff meetings • Operational\n• Co-determination • Work-life balance / • Internal publications improvement\n• Training opportunities parental leave • Employee survey suggestion scheme\n• Diversity & equal • Training and employee\nopportunities appraisals\n• Employee interviews\nScience and • Development of new • Networking of • Teaching assignment • University group visits\nuniversity technologies industry and research • Research projects • Allocation of doctoral\n• Promotion of research • Recruitment / PhD • Fairs & conferences positions\nand teaching students\nMedia • Innovation and • AIXTRON as employer • Interviews • Company receptions\nrepresentatives technologies • Finance • Press releases\n• Semiconductor\ntechnology\nGovernment • Eco-efficiency • Economic and labor • Meetings and • Participation in forums\nand politicians • Innovation and policy committees and events\ntechnology promotion\nMost important stakeholders, topics and forms of dialogue\n11\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\n12\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nSustainable corporate management and\nsustainability strategy\nΩ Who we are and what we do\nThe AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON” or “the Company”) is a leading provider of deposition\nequipment for the semiconductor industry. The company was founded in 1983 and is\nbased in Herzogenrath (Aachen region) with branches and representative offices in\nEurope, the USA, and Asia. At the end of 2023, we employed a total of 1,147 people\n(headcount). Since 2020, AIXTRON has been listed in the MDAX in addition to the TecDAX.\nAIXTRON's business activities include the development, production, and installation of\nsystems for the deposition of complex semiconductor materials, the development of\nprocess technologies, consulting, and training as well as customer support.\nOur products are used by customers worldwide to manufacture high-performance\ncomponents for power electronic and optoelectronic applications based on compound\nsemiconductors. These devices are used in a variety of innovative applications,\ntechnologies and industries. These include, for example, Micro LED and display\ntechnologies, data transmission, communication, signaling and lighting technology,\nsensors and power electronics based on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), as\nwell as many other high-tech applications.\nIn the 2023 reporting year, we\ninvested EUR 88 million (2022: EUR\n58 million) in research and\ndevelopment with revenues of EUR\n630 million (2022: EUR 463 million).\nThis corresponds to around 14% of\nour revenues, with an equity ratio of\n75% (2022: 73%). Asia accounted for\nthe lion's share of our revenues at\nalmost 50% (2022: 68%), followed by\nEurope at 30% (2022: 14%) and\nAmerica at 20% (2022: 18%).\n13\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nOur self-image and our values\nIn addition to economic success, our business activities also focus on ecological and social\nchallenges. Sustainability is a prerequisite for long-term economic success.\nAs a supplier to pioneering key industry, we conduct our business prudently and\nresponsibly, taking into account the interests of key stakeholders. The aim is to act\nsustainably at all levels of the value chain and to further promote sustainability in the\ncompany.\nActing responsibly is one of four corporate values at AIXTRON and is therefore a central\npart of our corporate culture. The Board of Directors and our managers have a particular\nresponsibility and act as role models.\nAs a future-oriented technology company, efficient and resource-optimized management\nhas always been part of our core business. Thanks to our technologies and systems,\nsemiconductors are becoming more and more efficient and resource-saving, which\nincreases the efficiency of a large number of end products.\nThis applies to applications from areas such as energy supply, electromobility,\nentertainment electronics, or communication. Our products thus contribute to reducing\nnot only our own ecological footprint but also that of our customers and especially that of\nthe end consumers in these areas (see also the chapter on innovations as a competitive\nfactor).\nseulav\nruO\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nExcellent.\nLeading position through goal-oriented action.\nForward thinking.\nProvide impulses for the future instead of following them.\nOpen minded.\nCommunicate openly for a healthy corporate culture.\nResponsible.\nSetting a good example for sustainable success.\n14\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Our sustainability strategy\nIn recent years, sustainability has been increasingly anchored in our company as an\nimportant principle of corporate management. The cornerstone for our current strategy\nwas laid in 2018. Two years later, concrete sustainability goals were defined and\nincentivized by the Supervisory Board and Board of Directors. In doing so, we have also\ngiven non-financial goals greater weight.\nAn important goal as part of our sustainability strategy was to become carbon neutral,\nwhich we achieved in 2019 for scope 1 and 2. That is why we purchase gray electricity\nplus green electricity certificates in the corresponding amount and reduce all unavoidable\nCO emissions through climate protection projects.\n2\nScope 1&2; AIXTRON Index 100 = 7.411 t CO2e in 2015; Industries Index 100 = Climate targets BMUV (284 Mio. t CO2e in 1990)\nSince the 2021 reporting year, we have also been reporting on the upstream value chain\n(Scope 3). This analysis was further optimized in the following reporting years. This is in\nline with our aim to continuously improve our sustainability activities and the associated\nguidelines, standards and programs. In this way, we can meet the needs and expectations\nof our stakeholders even better.\nAgainst this background, we have defined five priority topics in our sustainability strategy.\nAIXTRON sustainability strategy\nEnvironment and Employees, Respect for Society and social Combating\necology worker safety, human rights affairs corruption and\nhealth protection bribery\nThe five core topics of the AIXTRON sustainability strategy\nSome of these topics were defined in our “Sustainability Policy” and are also based on the\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations Sustainable Development\nGoals - SDG).\n15\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nThe SDGs we support relate to the following goals:\n• No poverty\n• Good health and well-being\n• Quality education\n• Gender equality\n• Affordable and clean energy\n• Decent work and economic growth\n• Industry, innovation and infrastructure\n• Responsible consumption and production\n• Climate Action\n• Life on land\nThese goals serve as orientation for our daily and strategic work.\nThe SDGs supported by AIXTRON relate to the above goals\n16\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Identification of material issues\nFor identification of the material topics for the 2023 reporting year, the materiality\nanalysis from the previous year was used and reviewed with regard to the changes from\nthe current financial year. No new material themes were identified, therefore the results\nare in line with those of the previous year. This materiality analysis was used to evaluate\nthe economic, ecological and social issues relevant to us.\nThe analysis focused on aspects that have a significant impact on our company. For this\npurpose, internal specialists and employees who are in constant communication with our\nstakeholders were surveyed. Through this comprehensive internal survey, which was\nbased on the expertise and many years of experience of our employees, we were also\nable to cover the external perspective.\nAs a result, five topic clusters were defined, that are depicted in the overview on page 15.\nThe following two graphics illustrate the importance of the respective topic complexes as\nwell as their chronological order - across all stakeholders.\nAIXTRON materiality analysis 2022 and 2023\n17\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nThe following overview shows the stakeholders' assessment of the respective time\nhorizon of the subject areas considered to be material.\nData protection and information\nsecurity\nTransparency of Financial\nInformation\nCorporate Governance and\nLong-term economic success\nCompliance\nAttracting and retaining qualified\nSustainable products and innovation\nworkers\nCustomer relationships Human rights\nCustomer focus Operational excellence\nRisk management Workers rights\nSupplier relationships Employee satisfaction\nEmployee promotion and\nResilience to external influences ...\n-development\n1-2 years 3-5 years > 5 years\nIn the following overview, the subject areas considered essential by the stakeholders are\nassigned to the three overarching subject areas of environment, social affairs, and\ncorporate management.\nEnvironment Social Corporate governance\nSustainable products and innovation Human rights Long-term economic success\nData protection and information\nCarbon footprint Workers rights\nsecurity\nTransparency of Financial\nEmployee satisfaction\nInformation\nEmployee promotion and Corporate Governance and\n-development Compliance\nAttracting and retaining qualified\nCustomer relationships\nworkers\nCustomer focus\nRisk management\nOperational excellence\nSupplier relationships\nResilience to external influences\n18\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Organizational anchoring\nThe Board of Directors of AIXTRON SE bears overall responsibility for the topic of\nsustainability. It is advised by the ESG and Sustainability department and decides on\nimportant sustainability issues. The respective departments and branches of AIXTRON SE\nare responsible for implementing the goals and projects decided by the Board of\nDirectors. The sustainability working group consists of those responsible for the\nrespective topic, e.g. B. innovation, technology, energy management, human resources,\nworks council, compliance, quality assurance or purchasing. The aim is to develop\nrelevant sustainability topics along the corporate strategy, to strengthen awareness of\nsustainable management, and to anchor it in all areas of the company. Within the\nworking group, the responsible individuals report the progress of individual projects to\nthe ESG and Sustainability department and manage the respective implementation. The\ncornerstones of our sustainability management are defined in our CSR guidelines and are\nbinding for all units of AIXTRON SE.\nBoard of Directors of AIXTRON SE\nis advised by...\nManager ESG & Sustainability\nSustainability Working Group\nconsists of responsible persons from the specialist departments …\nInnovation Board member Compliance\nTechnology Human resource Quality control\nEnergy management Work council Purchasing\nGoal\nDevelopment and implementation of sustainability topics\nStrengthen awareness of sustainable management\n19\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\n20\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nEnvironment\nWe see the protection of the environment as a key factor in the sustainability of our\nbusiness model and align our actions accordingly. In addition, we are in close contact with\nour customers and suppliers. Our innovative technologies and products, on which our\nsuccess is based and whose efficiency and performance convince our customers\nworldwide, make a decisive contribution.\nTechnology and climate protection\nThe basis for a sustainable future lies in electrifying the\nworld and moving away from fossil fuels. The further\nspread of e-mobility, renewable energies and energy-\nefficient technologies is crucial for this. This is of utmost\nimportance, especially given the current expansion of\nenergy-hungry applications of artificial intelligence.\nWith our systems, we ensure greater efficiency and\nsignificant CO savings in all of these areas. At the same\n2\ntime, we are already working on the solutions of\ntomorrow today and are currently investing around\nEUR 100 million in a new innovation center.\nDr. Felix Grawert · Chairman of the Board (CEO)\nOur customers benefit from forward-looking solutions that save costs, conserve\nresources, and are energy-efficient in equal measure. Our customers include companies\nfrom the areas of electromobility (drive trains, charging infrastructure), renewable\nenergies (network circuits), IT infrastructure (power supply), consumer electronics (3D\nsensors, fast chargers) as well as data transmission (fiber optic networks) and\ntelecommunications (5G network).\nWe also make a significant contribution to digital progress in the areas of display\ntechnology (mini and Micro LEDs), lighting and UV radiation for disinfection/hygiene.\nComponents for a variety of innovative applications, technologies and industries are\nmanufactured on AIXTRON systems.\n21\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nHighest precision in the manufacture of power electronics\nAs a technology leader, we have been shaping the further development of power\nelectronics and their manufacturing processes for more than 30 years.\nDue to their superior material properties, applications\nbased on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide\n(SiC) deliver significantly higher energy efficiency than\nclassic silicon. GaN technology, for example, is able to\nreduce energy losses during conversion by up to 40\npercent. In expert circles, we assume that GaN\ntechnology can save a total of 43 megatons of CO per\n2\nyear across the EU in the long term. In addition, we\nare currently working on the technologies of the\nfuture and expect further energy saving potential, for\nexample through the use of quantum technology.\nProf. Dr. Michael Heuken\nVice President Advanced Technologies\nOur technologies are at the heart of sustainable power electronics and thus support\nglobal efforts to combat climate change.\n22\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nΩ EU Taxonomy\nWith the Action Plan on Sustainable Growth, the EU Commission aims to make the\neconomic and financial system in the EU more sustainable. Climate neutrality should be\nachieved by 2050, i.e. the same amount of CO emissions should then be avoided or\n2\neliminated as is emitted. The core of this action plan is the EU taxonomy regulation, a\nstandardized classification system for sustainable economic activities. It defines six\nenvironmental goals:\nThe sustainable\nuse and Prevention and The protection\nThe transition\nClimate Adaptation to protection of reduction of and restoration\nto a circular\nprotection climate change water and environmental of biodiversity\neconomy\nmarine pollution and ecosystems\nresources\nAccording to EU taxonomy guidelines, economic activities are “environmentally\nsustainable” if they\n• make a significant contribution to achieving one or more of the six environmental goals\nmentioned,\n• do not significantly harm the achievement of the five other EU environmental targets\n(“Do no significant harm”; DNSH), and\n• comply with minimum regulations in accordance with Article 18 of the EU taxonomy,\nincluding human rights including occupational safety, corruption prevention, taxes,\ncompliance and antitrust law (“Minimum Safeguards”)\nWhether an economic activity makes a significant contribution to one of the goals and\ndoes not significantly affect the five other goals must be assessed using technical\nassessment criteria. In the 2023 financial year, information on how they can be allocated\nto the environmental goals must be provided for all six goals. In the previous year,\ninformation only had to be provided on the first two objectives in terms of their\ntaxonomy eligibility and taxonomy conformity.\n• Economic activities are “taxonomy-eligible” if they can be assigned to taxonomy\ndescriptions.\n• Activities are “taxonomy-aligned” if the taxonomy-eligible activities meet the above-\nmentioned criteria for environmental sustainability.\nAgainst the background of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, in the 2023 financial year we will\nreport on the taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned share of sales revenue, capital\nexpenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) of our economic activities. The\nindividual values can be found in the reporting forms in the Key figures chapter.\n23\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nΩ Method\nAs in the past two years, the EU taxonomy requirements were reviewed and analyzed in\nthe 2023 reporting year with the help of a project team in relation to the six EU\nenvironmental goals.\nIn the first step, the project team, which consists of experts from various disciplines,\nconfirmed that the economic sector “Manufacture of machines for other specific\neconomic sectors a.n.g.” (NACE Code 28.99) and the economic activities of the\n“Construction and Real Estate” category are currently applicable to AIXTRON.\nIn addition, we report 3.6 CapEx and OpEx B in connection with economic activities in\naccordance with paragraphs 1.1.2.2 and 1.2.3.2. of Annex I of Delegated Act (EU)\n2021/2178. This includes investment expenditure for the construction of a new\ninnovation center, which will serve to expand our taxonomy-compliant economic\nactivities in the future. In addition, research activities for the expansion of technologies\nare reported under economic activity 3.6.\nInterviews and workshops with the respective contacts and experts from the\ndepartments were then used to check whether our economic activities could be assigned\nto the taxonomy descriptions (eligibility check).\nThe experts' assessments were documented for sales, CapEx and OpEx and the relevant\nevidence and supporting documents were examined. The analysis was carried out taking\ninto account materiality aspects and cost/benefit considerations. AIXTRON has identified\nthe environmental goal “1 climate protection” as applicable. No taxonomy-eligible\neconomic activities within Environmental Goals 2 to 6 were identified. The following\neconomic activities were identified as eligible for taxonomy:\n• 3.1 Production of renewable energy technologies\n• 3.6 Manufacturing other low-carbon technologies\n• 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient devices\n• 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies\n24\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nUnlike criteria sets 3.1, 7.3 and 7.6, criteria set 3.6 contains a higher number of terms that\nrequire interpretation and are defined below. The set of criteria “Production of other low-\nCO technologies” is of particular relevance for the supplier industry in mechanical and\n2\nplant engineering. This set of criteria includes economic activities that produce\ntechnologies that aim to achieve significant savings in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions\nand are proven to achieve them compared to the best performing alternative technology\navailable on the market.\nFor the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities that fulfill the description\nof activity 3.6, those technologies were identified from AIXTRON's technology portfolio\nthat have low CO emissions in their application. The reduction in greenhouse gas\n2\nemissions must be significant. However, no minimum value is specified.\nIt can be assumed that the purpose pursued with the \"EU Action Plan on Financing\nSustainable Growth\" is to focus on technological leaps rather than efficiency increases\nwithin the existing system: A saving of 20% should regularly be significant and thus a\nsignificant one contribute to climate protection. AIXTRON has set this value as the\nminimum value for significant savings in CO emissions. A reference technology is the\n2\ntechnology that dominates the market and not a possibly very efficient niche technology\nwith only a very small market share. With regard to the reference standard, we therefore\nonly used this reference technology for the evaluation.\n25\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nThe analysis of the taxonomy conformity was carried out as follows:\n• Substantial Contribution: Compliance with the technical assessment criteria was\nchecked individually for each taxonomy-eligible business activity.\n• Do not significant harm (DNSH): DNSH compliance with the EU environmental goals 2.\nAdaptation to climate change, 3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources and 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems were\nassessed for locations with taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the Herzogenrath\nand Cambridge locations. The DNSH conformity with regard to the EU environmental\ngoals 4. Circular economy and 5. Pollution prevention and control were assessed at the\ngroup level and at the level of the business activity.\n• Minimum Safeguards: A Group-wide approach to ensuring the Minimum Safeguards\nrequirements with regard to the topics of corruption, fair competition, taxes and\nhuman rights was pursued, which appropriately takes into account the risk situation,\nthe circumstances, and the context of AIXTRON. We have conducted an impact analysis\nthat includes our own business unit as well as the upstream and downstream supply\nchain. Since no higher risk was identified for our own business unit and the\ndownstream supply chain, we focused on the upstream supply chain as part of a risk-\nbased approach. Country and product-specific aspects in particular were taken into\naccount as part of the risk-based approach. Due to the focused business model and the\ndemanding high-tech requirements, AIXTRON relies on a relatively small number of key\nsuppliers, most of whom are located in the border triangle (Belgium/Netherlands/\nGermany). In the 2023 financial year, for example, more than 99% of the total\npurchasing volume came from suppliers in OECD countries, which are generally\nconsidered to be low-risk. A detailed risk analysis was carried out for the remaining\nsuppliers from potentially higher risk countries. The minimum safeguards requirements\nare ensured using the existing compliance management structures (e.g. sustainability\nguidelines, global employment standards, code of ethics, conflict minerals management\nsystem, policy statement on human rights and environmental strategy as well as the\ncode of conduct for suppliers, supplier handbooks, whistleblowing mechanism). The\nfinal assessment did not identify any material adverse effects.\nΩ Substantial Contribution\nAs part of this analysis, the following taxonomy-eligible and at the same time taxonomy-\neligible and/or aligned economic activities were identified at AIXTRON, which make a\nsignificant contribution to environmental goal 1. Climate change mitigation.\n26\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nProduction of other low-CO technologies (3.6)\n2\nAIXTRON develops, produces and sells systems for the deposition of compound\nsemiconductors.

In this context, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new innovation\ncenter took place in November 2023 at the Herzogenrath location with an investment\nvolume of around EUR 100 million. The R&D process starts with basic research on\nmaterials and then moves on to processes and procedures. A key result of our research\nwork is our innovative product portfolio with technology solutions that enable our\ncustomers to manufacture products that save greenhouse gas emissions during their use.\nWe work together with predominantly renowned universities, research centers, and\nindustrial partners around the world in order to implement demanding projects on a\nnational and international level in partnership. We benefit from the fact that we can work\ntogether with qualified partners, but at the same time, we are also in demand as a\npartner for research projects.\nWhen developing innovations for materials and processes, we work together with our\npartners in nationally or Europe-wide funded joint projects. In close cooperation,\nsolutions are created that should lead to marketable products.\nIn the section \"Research and Development\" section of the AIXTRON Annual Report 2023,\nyou will find some examples of research projects in which AIXTRON is involved.\nΩ Expenditures and grants for R&D\n33\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nΩ Climate balance sheet\nFor the reporting year 2023, AIXTRON reports all emissions in the corresponding scopes in\nwhich the necessary information is available.

These were also determined for the\nprevious year and the reported values were adjusted accordingly.\nThe total emissions figure for 2023 as a whole is therefore higher than the figures\ncalculated for 2022. Reasons for this increase include the increased business volume and\nproduction capacity utilization.

A separate disclosure of Scope 3.9 is not possible due to the data situation. In\nprinciple, the values were calculated on the basis of consumption or determined quantities. The value-based approach was chosen in Scope 3.1 for the areas of\nhealthcare/social services, service/consulting and software, as it is not possible to express the data in kilograms for these categories. Instead, metrics based on euro\nvalues were used to present the relevant information. The quantities in Scope 3.11 in kWh refer to a life cycle of the machines of 10 years.\nIn addition to technical measures to reduce emissions, such as heat pumps and LED\nlighting, we are reducing our carbon footprint based on gross emissions by using green\nelectricity from green electricity certificates at all locations for the first time in 2023.

To support this project, an energy management system based on\nthe ISO 50001 standard has been implemented at AIXTRON SE's German locations since\n2014. The function of this system was determined by the external auditor during the last\nrecertification in April 2023 and the certificate was extended for a further three years.\nΩ Further development of the energy management system\nAt the Dornkaulstrasse location, the newly installed heat pump was included in the cloud-\nbased energy management software in 2023. This means that all data on performance,\nconsumption and operation can now be tracked, evaluated and compared with historical\ndata, regardless of location.\nAs a further project, our own metering systems were installed to monitor consumption in\nrental properties used by AIXTRON. These can provide real-time transparency about your\nown energy consumption and also enable direct control options in the future to further\noptimize energy management.\nΩ “Energy awareness begins in the mind!”\nSince 2023, AIXTRON has been committed to increasing energy awareness, especially\namong new employees: On-boarding via AIXTRON's own training platform not only\nprovides information about energy management at AIXTRON, but also contains practical\nenergy-saving and environmental tips. The tips can be applied directly at work and some\nare also suitable for imitation at home. This is intended to promote energy- and\nenvironmentally conscious behavior in the long term.\nElectricity from renewable energy sources and photovoltaics\nSince the reporting year, we have only purchased gray electricity with green electricity\ncertificates at all locations. In addition, we have already installed a photovoltaic system\nat our Kaiserstrasse location. 100% of the electricity generated in 2023, amounting to\n3,408 kWh, will be fed into the electricity grid.\n37\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nPractical examples\nDerived from our systematic energy management, we have already initiated and\nimplemented many projects and measures with the aim of sustainably reducing energy\nconsumption. The most important projects of the past year are listed here as examples:\nNew 4-pipe air heat pump compensates for gas consumption\nFor a number of years, we have been successfully using waste heat from the cooling\nprocesses in our laboratories at our central location in Herzogenrath, and using it\nspecifically for heating the building. It has already been possible to save 90 percent of\ngas and 10 percent of electricity consumption. A new 4-pipe air heat pump was installed\nat the end of 2022, which will avoid most of the remaining gas consumption. The device\nis the latest technology available on the market: the combination device can be used for\nboth cold and hot water production. To do this, it uses independent and mutually closed\ncircuits. This enables us to further reduce the footprint of CO emissions that we directly\n2\ncause.\nState-of-the-art lighting technology\ncreates even more energy efficiency\nAIXTRON replaced the existing lighting\nsystems at its worldwide locations with\nthe latest LED lighting technology in\n2023. This will enable us to further\nreduce energy consumption.\n* When calculating the energy and CO2 savings, we were advised by external companies who gave us technical advice with their engineering knowledge and specialist\nknow-how. All calculations were based on a systematic and scientifically sound approach with specific assumptions for the calculations.\n38\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nEnergy saving targets achieved for the sixth year in a row\nIn the past fiscal year, we were able to increase our revenues significantly, which was\naccompanied by a higher demand for electricity. However, thanks to the various energy-\nsaving projects, we were able to mitigate the increase in overall consumption. Energy\nrequirements rose by 9.4% in the past financial year, with energy consumption per\nEUR million in revenues falling by 19.5%.\nOur successes are confirmation and incentive at the same time: Every year we review our\nstatus quo and set ourselves new, ambitious energy-saving targets. At the same time, this\nis also an economic consideration for us, because the lower consumption also reduces\nour costs.\nWe are constantly developing our measures to increase energy efficiency. Our targets\nrelate primarily to our research and production sites in Germany and the UK.\nThe electricity requirement in 2023 was with 14,179,599 kWh higher than in 2022\n(12,677,293 kWh). The reason for this was the continued strong growth in business\nvolume and the continuing good order situation.\nThe demand for fossil fuels (218,789 kWh natural gas and 2,340 kWh fuel oil) and district\nheating (2,099,490 kWh) has fallen significantly to a total of 2,320,619 kWh compared to\n2022 (2,400,303 kWh). This is proof of the effectiveness of our ambitious energy\nmanagement and our strategy of using waste heat and state-of-the-art heat pumps.\n39\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nΩ Power consumption\n(kWh) Energy 2023 2022 Δ\nNatural gas/oil Scope 1 221,129 426,321 -48.1%\nElectricity Scope 2 14,179,599 12,677,293 11.9%\nLong distance\nScope 2 2,099,490 1,973,982 6.4%\nheating\nTotal 16,500,218 15,077,596 9.4%\nEnergy intensity (kWh/EUR Mio.

Sources include, in particular, delivery packaging, offcuts,\nleftover consumables, but also leftovers from repair, renovation or construction activities\nor experiments.\nΩ Separation and disposal of waste\nIn order to return as much of the waste generated by AIXTRON as possible back into the\nrecycling cycle, the waste is separated according to type. To this end, a pictorial labeling\nsystem began to be rolled out in productive areas in 2023. This made the separation more\ntransparent in practice.\nWhen disposing of our waste, the focus is on bringing the waste materials into\nappropriate recycling processes. We work with waste disposal companies that are\ncertified as specialist waste disposal companies. We prefer regional disposal methods\nhere. We want to limit transport routes to a minimum and at the same time ensure a high\nlevel of reliability.\nHazardous waste that has to be removed from the recycling cycle due to its properties is\neliminated. This is done using officially approved disposal methods so that they do not\ncause any harm to the environment or people. Using our physical-chemical expertise and\nworking with external experts, we strive to keep the amount of hazardous waste that\nneeds to be disposed of as low as possible. This happens, for example, through the use of\nsuitable cleaning or treatment processes.\nThe increased amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in Herzogenrath (D) and\nCambridge (UK) is due to the increase in production volume. In Germany, the amount of\nwaste disposed of by municipalities was also recorded for the first time in 2023.\nHazardous waste (kg) Non-hazardous waste (kg)\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nGermany 36,471 1,834 573,038 76,708\nUK 1,575 2 53,980 62,532\nAsia/USA 0 0 13,065 34,849\nTotal 38,046 1,836 640,083 174,089\nHazardous and non-hazardous waste by region.

Systems are developed and optimized jointly in some cases. We also\nsupport our customers in training employees. As a rule, this requires corresponding travel\nactivity by our employees. Most of our customers are based outside of Germany, which\naffects the kilometers traveled and the choice of transport.\nΩ Commuter behavior\nIn the 2023 reporting year, we once again conducted a global survey on work commuting\nbehavior among all employees. The extrapolation turned out that 41% of the Group’s\nemployees come to work sustainably: 17% walk or use a bicycle/e-bike, 13% use public\ntransport and 11% rely on vehicles with alternative drives - be it hybrid - 3% or purely\nbattery electric vehicles 8%. At 59%, however, the majority still uses vehicles with classic\ncombustion engines.\nWe have a total of 15 e-car charging stations and 24 e-bike charging stations on our\ncompany premises in Herzogenrath.\nNumber of employees per means of transport and the shares in % (extrapolation from survey with the average headcount 2023)\n42\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nEnvironment\nΩ Air travel\nTraveling by plane cannot always be avoided as we sell our systems and technologies\nworldwide. However, we are trying to limit our air travel to what is necessary. For\nintercontinental travel, however, they are the only viable option in day-to-day business.\nIn the reporting year 2023, there were 4,311 bookings (2022: 2,450).\nA total of 11,096,320 kilometers were flown (2022: 5,801,299 km), an increase of 91%\ncompared to 2022.\nThe reason for this increase compared to 2022 is the relaxed travel restrictions in\nconnection with the corona pandemic.\nΩ Company vehicles\nEnd of 2023, our company fleet consisted of 14 cars (2022: 14), two diesel-powered\nvehicle, four four gasoline-powered vehicles, five hybrid-powered vehicles, and three\npurely electric vehicle. Since 2020, in accordance with our internal guidelines, we have\nlimited ourselves to hybrid and electric cars when purchasing new company vehicles. In\n2023, compared to 2022, no vehicles with pure combustion engines were added.

These are\nbased on the know-how of our dedicated colleagues, who ensure the innovative strength\nof the company. Our position is strengthened by the many talented new employees that\nwe are able to recruit: Structured HR work and safe, healthy and employee-friendly\nworking conditions are essential prerequisites for this. Because only satisfied and\ncommitted employees enable long-term entrepreneurial best performance.\nΩ Occupational safety and health protection\nOur principle of occupational safety is \"zero tolerance for accidents\". We are pursuing a\npreventive approach. Our top priority is always to avoid any injuries and to minimize\npossible risks. Every accident at work is therefore examined in order to identify and\npermanently eliminate potential risks in our technical and organizational processes.\nOccupational safety and health protection are the responsibility of our managers. Our\ngoal is for every employee to understand and support our goals and measures in the area\nof occupational safety and health protection as part of their job. In spring 2023, this also\nincluded hygiene concepts based on the recommendations of the federal and state\ngovernments and the Robert Koch Institute for combating pandemics.\n\"Safety First!\" - that's what the Occupational Health and Safety Committee ensures\nThe members of the Occupational Health and Safety Committee (OHSC), consisting of a\nmanagement representative, two members of the works council, the company doctor,\nthe safety experts and the safety officer, meet every quarter. This group of participants\nis supplemented in the OHSC meetings by members of the severely disabled\nrepresentative, representatives of the human resources and compliance departments\nand facility management.\nIt is our aim to train our employees at least once a year in occupational health and\nsafety issues. Current aspects from working areas are included in the instructions.\nTwo internal safety experts, together with the company doctor, are responsible for\nadvising the company management, the executives, the works council and the\nemployees.\nThe companies first aid service at the German locations is currently supported by a total\nof 108 first aiders.\n46\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nΩ Employee Health and Safety\nThe number of days lost from work was 29 in 2023 (2022: 41). There were 4 accidents on\nbusiness trips in 2023 (2022: 5) and a total of 17 injuries with entries in the first aid\nmanual (2022: 9). As in previous years, we, fortunately, had no deaths to report in 2023.\nAt AIXTRON, around 26% of our workforce works in production and around 34% in\nresearch & development. These are workplaces where the environment must meet the\nhighest safety standards and every move — even unconscious ones — must be made\nsafely and smoothly. For this reason, we attach great importance to regular training and\noptimal occupational safety equipment.\nA company integration management system after prolonged illness and reintegration\nassistance after accidents are not just legal obligation for us. They are part of our\ncorporate culture and are crucial for maintaining the ability to work and employability of\nour employees at all locations. In the reporting period, no penalties or fines were\nimposed on AIXTRON due to violations of occupational health and safety regulations.\n2023 2022\nLTIFR = Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate * 0.44 0.19\nIR = Injury Rate ** 0.88 1.48\nAccidents at work 4 9\nWorking days lost (work-related sickness and accidents) *** 29 41\nAccidents on way to/from work 4 5\nWork-related sickness 0 0\n* LTIFR = Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate; Number of accidents at work (excluding accidents on way to/from work) resulting in lost time of more than one working\nday in relation to the number of hours actually worked in the reporting period, normalized to two hundred thousand working hours.\n** Number of reportable accidents / hours worked, normalized to two hundred thousand hours worked.\n*** Days lost from work as a result of occupational diseases and accidents at work (excluding accidents on the way to and from work).\nHealth protection is a management issue\nThe health and well-being of our employees are our top priority. As preventive measures\nas part of health management, we offer our employees e.g. regular and ongoing\noccupational medical examinations as well as flu vaccinations.\nWe are aware that good working conditions, a collegial and constructive environment,\nand a cooperative management style have an important influence on the well-being and\nhealth of our employees. For this reason, we attach great importance to a cooperative\nand constructive feedback culture.\nOur employees are encouraged by our managers to take responsibility for themselves and\ntheir colleagues. In addition, we allow our employees the greatest possible flexibility in\nwork planning to reconcile private life and work - as far as operational requirements\nallow.\n47\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nWith our technology and continuous innovation,\nwe are constantly pushing the boundaries of what\nis technically feasible. The basis for this is our\nstrong AIXTRON team. Its diversity, creativity and\nthe desire to work together to make an important\ncontribution to a sustainable, networked world\nare deeply rooted in the AIXTRON DNA. As an\nemployer in an industry of the future, with a\nmodern working environment and exciting\nactivities, we have succeeded in 2023 in increasing\nAIXTRON's attractiveness as an employer and\nfurther expanding our workforce.\nDr. Christian Danninger · Executive Board (CFO)\nΩ Diversity and equal opportunities\nWe see diversity as a real opportunity: Because only through equal opportunities can we\ndevelop our full innovative power and strengthen our competitiveness. In the future, we\naim to continuously increase the proportion of female employees in our company, e.g.\nthrough targeted recruitment in the area of apprenticeships, the expansion of our\ncollaboration with local universities, trade fair visits and communication on our social\nmedia channels. In addition, we plan to increase diversity at our senior management level\nin a targeted manner.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 81% of male and 19% of female employees were employed.\nOur diversity in terms of cooperation between employees from different cultures is\nalready very strong: In 2023, 1,147 employees (2022: 940) from around 61 (2022: 50)\nnations were working for AIXTRON worldwide.\n48\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nFlexible working day, employee recruitment & retention\nΩ Age structure at AIXTRON by region 2023\nThe age structure of our employees at AIXTRON by region for fiscal year 2023 is as\nfollows:\n49\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nTransparent communication\nIn order to ensure good cooperation, we attach great importance to open and\ncooperative communication. This also includes regular and transparent information for\nthe entire workforce. Quarterly, the Management Board informs all colleagues worldwide\nin digital employee meetings about business development, customer requests, market\ndevelopments or new company agreements. In addition, all relevant information is\npublished promptly in the appropriate media.

We also offer our employees individually tailored part-time\njobs. In 2023, there were a total of 104 part-time employees (2022: 71), of whom 39 were\nwomen (2022: 33) and 65 were men (2022: 38).\nFlexible working models for the time after the pandemic\nWith a view to the time after the pandemic, a company agreement was passed in 2022\nthat generally allows employees to work mobile to an extent of up to 80% of the\nstandard working time. The respective framework depends individually on the type of\nactivity as well as the area and department. For this reason, individual maximum quotas\nwere agreed in order to take account of the respective operational needs.\nAt our global locations, we also encourage people to take advantage of the regulations\nthat apply there in the same way as they do for parental leave: In Europe, for example, a\ntotal of 22 employees took parental leave (2022: 25). In the Asia/USA regions, the offer\nwas not used in 2023 (2022: 1). We are pleased that 19 of the 22 employees returned to\nwork after their parental leave during the reporting year (2022: 19).\nParental leave taken Employees returning to\nwork after parental\nleave\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nEurope 22 25 19 19\nAsia / USA 0 1 0 1\nSince 2012 we have been supporting a local daycare center (TP Hasen) to support\nAIXTRON employees and parents at the Herzogenrath site in their search for a daycare\ncenter close to the workplace.\n51\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nΩ Temporary work and fixed-term contracts\nDue to the great importance of special knowledge and expertise, AIXTRON has a strong\ninterest in retaining its employees in the company in the long term. At the same time,\nAIXTRON products are sometimes subject to strong fluctuations in demand. In order to be\nable to react flexibly to these fluctuations, we also use fixed-term contracts or work\ntogether with established engineering service providers and temporary employment\nagencies.\n2023 2022\nPermanent Temporary Permanent Temporary\nMen 592 72 475 58\nGER\nWomen 134 28 109 19\nMen 105 2 84 5\nUK\nWomen 16 0 14 0\nAsia/ Men 159 0 110 28\nUSA Women 39 0 38 0\nMen 856 74 669 91\nTotal\nWomen 189 28 161 19\nTotal (headcount) 1,147 940\nTotal (FTE) 1,086 895\nAt the German locations, we have concluded a works agreement for such cases. In\naddition, we are committed worldwide to the principle of “equal pay” and compliance\nwith the principle of equal treatment for temporary workers and permanent staff after 15\nmonths of employment.\nFor example, likewise with our employees, temporary workers receive meal allowances\nfor using our cafeteria and can also take advantage of training programs offered by our\nAIXTRON Academy. Temporary workers are equally welcome at company events such as\nemployee and workers meetings as well as summer or Christmas parties.\n52\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nIn 2023, AIXTRON employed an annual average of 103 temporary workers (2022: 82). Of\nthese, 94 (2022: 73) temporary workers worked for us in Germany, 7 in England (2022: 8)\nand 2 in Asia (2022: 1). Of the 1,147 employees, 1,045 (2022: 830) had a permanent\ncontract. The number of fixed-term contracts in the reporting year totaled 102 employees\n(2022: 110), which corresponds to a share of almost 9% (2022: 12%) of the total\nworkforce. Of these, 28 were women (2022: 19) and 74 were men (2022: 91).\nInflation premium and salary level\nIn view of the inflation trend and rising energy costs, AIXTRON has decided to fully utilize\nthe legal framework of EUR 3,000 of the German government's relief package for its\nemployees. In December 2023, all (full-time) employees therefore received the second\npart of inflation compensation bonus of EUR 1,500 — tax- and duty-free (The first bonus\nwas paid in December 2022 in the amount of EUR 1,500, part-time employees received\nthe amount on a pro rata basis). This is intended to help our employees cope better with\nthe rising cost of living.\nIn 2023, the average salary level of AIXTRON employees across the Group was examined\nfor the first time in comparison with the applicable minimum wages in the individual\ncountries. This shows that, on average, 3.6 times the minimum wage was paid across the\nGroup in 2023.\n2023\nØ AIXTRON salary / Ø minimum wage 3.6\nØ FTE (fix & varable paid in year) in EUR 83,051\nØ Minimum Wage/FTE in EUR 22,925\nΩ Attracting and retaining highly qualified employees\nAIXTRON operates in a rapidly changing economic environment and relies on highly\nqualified and committed specialists and managers. Being an attractive employer is\nimportant to us in order to attract and retain the best talent and employees.\nIn the reporting year 2023, the number of employees was strongly increased — a\nconsistent consequence of AIXTRON's continuing good order situation. We were able to\nadd a total of 207 employees (2022: 238) (balance: additions minus departures) — 37 of\nthem women and 170 men.

The EU\nfunding program QUANTIMONY (\"Innovative Training Network in Quantum\nSemiconductor Technologies Exploiting Antimony\") is an innovative network for doctoral\ntraining and offers 14 young researchers high-level training.\nThe network consists of eleven international research teams and is supported by 13\npartner organizations from Europe as well as the USA, Taiwan and Brazil.\nWith the help of QUANTIMONY, antimony (Sb) compounds are expected to make their\nway into mass production — using MOCVD technology and for use in computers,\nmemories, telecommunications, automobiles, robotics and many other applications.\nThese go beyond existing applications in aerospace. Quantum technologies based on\nantimony are an important future field and the potential applications are very\npromising.\nFurthermore, we regularly support the training of students for bachelor's and master's\ntheses in the laboratories of AIXTRON SE in cooperation with universities - as we did in\n2023.\nProject not part of the auditor's review\nFor more information on personnel selection, please refer to the section \"Employees\" in\nthe chapter \"Business model\" in the Group management report.\n55\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nΩ Personnel development, training and continuing education\nLifelong learning, the further training of our employees and their expertise in specialist\nareas provide us with the prerequisites for maintaining our leading position in the long\nterm.

This also includes individual training\nmeasures. The core component of this is the company's own AIXTRON Academy, which\noffers general training courses on topics such as project management, negotiation skills\nand time and self-management, as well as specialized content. Specialist training courses\nare also organized in cooperation with external providers.\nWe also promote the development of managers and employees through coaching\nprograms and management training. We also increasingly support dialogue between\nemployees, e.g. through our \"Change Swarm\". This is an employee initiative that\norganizes network meetings, develops current measures for the organization and actively\nobtains feedback from employees.\nIn our annual employee appraisals, development and training needs as well as the\npersonal interests and needs of employees are recorded.\nIn 2023, AIXTRON invested an average of over EUR 583 (2022: EUR 568) per employee in\npersonnel development and training. On average, each employee received over 32.0\nhours of training per year in 2023 (2022: 32.8).\nSecuring our young talent with training\nWe see it not only as our social obligation but also as the basis for the continued success\nof our company to train young people in technical and commercial professions as well as\nin dual study programs. In this way, we give young people the chance to prove\nthemselves, develop their strengths with us, and make a contribution. We are proud that\nAIXTRON trainees are repeatedly recognized for outstanding performance by the Aachen\nChamber of Industry and Commerce.\n56\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nIn fiscal 2023, we employed a total of 81 trainees and students (2022: 53). It is important\nto us to offer young people prospects after they have completed their training.\nFor this reason, all trainees and dual students who wished to remain with the company\nwere taken on in recent years. To this end, a corresponding agreement was reached with\nthe works council at the Herzogenrath site.\n57\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nCompany suggestion scheme\nNew ideas and wishes often arise in the thoroughly structured and planned everyday\nprocesses, some of which are not implemented or shared throughout the company.\nHowever, as we want to make these usable and valuable for everyone, we established a\nglobally standardized company suggestion scheme as part of the innovation management\nprocess in 2015.\nWe encourage our employees to submit their ideas for process improvements, cost\nsavings, product enhancements, or the like. This year, a total of 101 suggestions were\nsubmitted and 35 of these were accepted. Although these figures are below the 2022\nlevel, the latter include ideas within a specific, topic-related call. Since its introduction,\nthe number of improvement suggestions submitted has been at a gratifyingly high level.\nSince 2015, the submitted and accepted suggestions have been remunerated.\n58\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nΩ Regional and social engagement\nWe see our company as part of society and in this sense, we also want to fulfill our social\nresponsibility. For this reason, we have been sponsoring social projects for many years\nand supporting the voluntary work of our employees at the annual company run. In\naddition, we give schoolchildren and students the opportunity to gain professional\norientation by gaining an insight into our company.\nPromotion of science, education and professional development\nSupporting young people in science, education and career development is important to\nus. Since 2017, we have therefore maintained long-term school cooperation with\nAachen's Einhard Gymnasium. We also offer schoolchildren and students the opportunity\nto gain insight into the various professional fields of our technology company through\nlectures, company tours, or internships. As a sponsoring member of the Industry and\nEconomy Working Group of the German Physical Society, we have thus been offering the\n\"Day on Site\" for many years, for example.\nCooperation with the Aachen Einhard High School\nSince 2017, AIXTRON and Einhard-Gymnasium in Aachen have been involved in a\nlearning partnership as part of the KURS initiative (Cooperation Network for Companies\nin the Region and Schools). As part of this \"learning partnership\", schools have the\nopportunity to give their students a tangible demonstration of business using the\nconcrete example of a partner company. At the same time, companies have the\nopportunity to present themselves as employers and \"good neighbors\".\nFor example, as part of \"career exploration days\" and \"Girls' and Boys' Day\", the\nstudents were given the opportunity to have a personal exchange with our trainees\nduring a company visit. Reports on their experiences with career guidance were\nexchanged and the topic of training and related career opportunities at AIXTRON were\ndiscussed. In addition, dual training and study programs were presented as an\nalternative to university studies, and a selection process was simulated as part of an\nassessment center. At the regular \"Berufsstraße\" event, we also explain in detail the\nvarious apprenticeships at AIXTRON to school students and are available to answer their\nindividual questions.\nCooperation with the German Physical Society in the \"Day on Site\" programme\nSince 2007, AIXTRON has participated in the German Physical Society's (DPG) \"Day on\nSite\" laboratory visit programme. As part of this programme, students and doctoral\ncandidates from all over Germany have the opportunity to obtain first-hand information\nabout the professional field of physicists. Lectures on the various \"disciplines\" of the\nphysicist's activities in an industrial environment, as well as a company tour through the\nlaboratories of AIXTRON SE are part of the programme. This year's edition of the \"Day\non Site\" took place at AIXTRON on 31 May 2023 with 12 registrations.\n59\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nSocial\nForth „AIXTRON Global Virtual Run“\nIn the past reporting year 2023, our “AIXTRON Global Virtual Run” (AGVR) took place for\nthe forth time. Once again, more than 250 colleagues from Germany, the UK, the USA,\nMalaysia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China took part. Participants could choose between\njogging, walking and cycling. In 2023, AIXTRON employees covered round about 1,665\nkilometers walking and running (2022: more than 1,500 kilometer) and 2,480 kilometer\nby bike (2022: 2,190 kilometers) as a team.\nThe annual \"Global Virtual Run\" was first launched in 2020 - partly in response to the\nCorona pandemic. This was because it allowed employees to do something sporty\ntogether. This was regardless of where they happened to be in the world, without having\nto come together in one place. The focus of the \"Virtual Run\" is on the \"we feeling\": A\nkind of competition does develop. But it's less about which individuals achieve the best\ntimes, and more about how much the AIXTRON team can achieve together.\nWe have been taking part in the annual Aachen company run since 2011 and have once\nagain taken part in the Chariots of Fire relay race in Cambridge. We support our\nemployees' motivation to do something for their health and pay the entry fees, which are\nthen donated to charitable organisations in the region.\n60\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\n61\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nCorporate Governance\nAIXTRON is committed to the principles of transparent, responsible corporate governance\nfocused on sustainable value creation. By managing and monitoring the Company\naccordingly, we — the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board — aim to live up to the\ntrust placed in us by our shareholders, the financial markets, our customers, business\npartners, employees, and the general public. We are convinced that this type of\nsustainable corporate governance, as well as the responsible actions of our employees,\nform an essential basis for the success of our company.\nThe corporate governance declaration pursuant to sections 289f, 315d of the German\nCommercial Code (HGB) and the current declaration of conformity pursuant to\nsection 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which was adopted by the\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board in February 2024, are permanently available on\nour website under Investoren/Corporate Governance.\nΩ Compliance, ethics and information security\nThe Executive Board is committed to conducting all business in an ethical and legally\nsound manner. In addition to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, our\ninternal guidelines and the requirements of internal stakeholders are taken into account.\nAIXTRON does not tolerate any corrupt or criminal behavior and expressly distances itself\nfrom human rights violations. In addition to the legal and regulatory requirements, our\ninternal company codes, guidelines, and management systems provide the framework for\naction.\nSince 2006, the AIXTRON Code of Ethics has applied in particular to members of the\nExecutive Board and throughout the company to finance managers and persons in key\nfinance positions. This is intended to ensure that honest and ethical behavior is practiced.\nFinance managers and persons in key finance functions confirm annually for their area of\nresponsibility that the Code of Ethics issued by the Executive Board is known and\ncomplied with in daily activities.\nIn addition, a Compliance code of conduct applies to the Executive Board, Senior\nmanagement team and all employees group-wide, which obliges them to behave\nresponsibly and in accordance with the law. This is specified by the regularly updated\nCompliance manual and additional compliance rules and regulations with detailed\nguidelines and is taught provided in training sessions.\nTraining for the updated compliance guidelines, in particular for the compliance manual,\nstarted in the fourth quarter of the 2023 financial year. Participation in compliance\ntraining is mandatory for our new employees and remains part of their onboarding\nprogram. In addition, further compliance training is addressed and carried out as required\n- in the course of risk assessment and/or possible compliance violations. The compliance\ntraining process is managed and its implementation monitored by our Compliance\ndepartment.\n62\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nOur company-wide Anti-Corruption Policy defines formal and concrete rules and\nprinciples of conduct to combat corruption and bribery and is binding for our employees.\nAn elementary component of our company-wide compliance training program is to\nsensitize our employees to identify potential corruption and bribery risks in their daily\nactivities at an early stage. This also includes preventive anti-corruption measures.\nAs in the previous year, no incidents of bribery and corruption were reported to us\nthroughout the AIXTRON Group in the 2023 reporting year. In addition, adherence to our\ncompliance requirements is confirmed in writing on a quarterly basis by the senior\nmanagement team and by employees in key positions.\nReports of possible violations of international and national laws as well as our company-\nwide compliance guidelines and rules of conduct can be reported directly to AIXTRON's\nCompliance Department and via AIXTRON's Whistleblowing System.\nΩ Responsibility within the supply chain\nAIXTRON places the same expectations and conditions on its suppliers as it does on itself.\nThese are defined in a mandatory supplier manual.\nThis defines the ethical and legal framework for social and ecological standards, e.g. with\nregard to corruption, or conflict minerals such as raw materials and mineral resources\nthat are mined or extracted in conflict areas.\nIn addition to the price and quality of the purchased goods, compliance with these\nstandards is a fundamental prerequisite for long-term cooperation (see chapter “Conflict\nminerals”).\nAIXTRON does not currently fall within the scope of the German Supply Chain Compliance\nAct (LkSG). Nevertheless, AIXTRON endeavors to maintain a compliance program based\non the LkSG for the protection of human rights and the environment in AIXTRON's\nbusiness and supply chain in order to promote compliance with human rights and\nenvironmental standards as a basis for sustainable development and to meet AIXTRON's\nclaim to be a reliable and responsible business partner (see also chapter Key figures on\nsupplier relationships).\n63\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nΩ Conflict Minerals\nCompetition for natural resources such as minerals, oil, and charcoal promotes the\nsystematic violation of human rights and environmental pollution worldwide. Proceeds\nfrom the extraction of raw materials help fuel armed conflicts and finance civil wars.\nProduction or mining of these materials often takes place illegally and outside state\ncontrol, controlled by groups of rebels or militias, and at the expense of the miners.\nAIXTRON is committed to conducting its business fairly and with decency and respect in\nall countries where the company is present. Therefore, AIXTRON supports the objectives\nof both the US Dodd-Frank Act and the EU Conflict Minerals Regulations to disclose the\norigin of risky minerals used in our products. As part of its due diligence, the AIXTRON\nGroup has implemented a management system for this purpose, based on the OECD\nGuidelines for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk\nregions.\nAll direct suppliers who may be supplying materials with potential conflict minerals are\ncontacted and asked to identify the countries of origin of the minerals and report them to\nAIXTRON. Should this reveal the use of a raw material supplier that is linked to human\nrights violations and environmental pollution, we react consistently and work to ensure\nthat this supplier critically examines the raw material supplier in question and removes it\nfrom the joint supply chain. In order to enable internal and external persons and\nstakeholders to raise indications, concerns, and complaints in connection with conflict\nminerals - anonymously if desired - AIXTRON has established a complaints mechanism,\nwhich can be viewed on the AIXTRON website, among others.\n64\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nAIXTRON's ability to work towards completely conflict-free smelters worldwide as part of\nits supply chain is limited. In order to maximize the influence and impact of conflict-free\nsourcing, we decided to join the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) many years ago.\nΩ Privacy compliance\nHandling the personal data of our customers, employees and other important\nstakeholders in a legally compliant and trustworthy manner is our top priority. For many\nyears, data protection has been anchored in our company through forms of guidelines,\nstandards, and processes. The requirements of the European Union's General Data\nProtection Regulation (EU GDPR), which has applied in all member states since May 2018,\nare taken into account in our data protection guidelines. These data protection guidelines\nare subject to regular review and further development, such as our overarching data\nprotection guideline.\nIn implementing the legal requirements, we are supported and advised by an external,\nindependent data protection officer. We did not report any incidents to our data\nprotection officer or the relevant authorities for the reporting year 2023.\nΩ Information Security\nThe protection of our business and trade secrets as well as the protection of sensitive\ndata is of very high importance to us as a global technology company with high innovative\nstrength. In times of advancing digitization and networking in our society, the threat of\ncyber espionage and sabotage is also growing. Information security has played an\nessential role for years and enjoys a very high priority because attacks on our IT\ninfrastructure can lead to the loss or violation of the integrity of this sensitive and\nconfidential data. Our \"Information Security\" department is part of the independent\ncorporate governance organization and is tasked with continuously identifying, analyzing,\nand evaluating potential vulnerabilities in our organization and infrastructure together\nwith our IT department and other specialist departments. Based on these results, suitable\nprotection mechanisms are integrated into our existing information security environment\nand their effectiveness is monitored.\nIn addition to technical and organizational measures, our employees and their awareness\nin dealing with sensitive and confidential data play a very important role. Our company-\nwide training program and the mandatory participation of our employees in regular\nInformation security training sessions are key components in promoting awareness. Our\nexisting information security environment is subject to continuous further development\nin order to protect our business and trade secrets as well as sensitive data in the best\npossible way. In fiscal year 2023, we were not aware of any incidents relating to breaches\nof our information security.\n65\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nQuality management and product safety\nGerman Sustainability Award 2023 - Pioneer of\ntransformation\nAIXTRON was a finalist in the Mechanical\nEngineering category in 2023. The certificate\nstated that AIXTRON is one of the companies\n\"that demonstrate particularly effective,\nsuccessful and exemplary contributions to\ntransformation in their fields [...]\".\nWe enjoy a leading position in the market, resulting from a great deal of trust placed in us\nby our customers. For us, it is both an obligation and an incentive to ensure our technical\nexcellence, first-class service and high-quality standards at all times.\nWe consistently pursue a zero-defect strategy in our promise of quality and the safety of\nour equipment. This is the claim we make on ourselves, as well as on our suppliers. It is\nnot only our self-image to comply with all legal product requirements, standards and\nnorms as well as safety aspects and proper labelling.\nIt is also part of our self-image to implement all local requirements in our customer\nmarkets. For this reason, product safety begins with our product development and\naccompanies the entire procurement and production process.\nFormal, overarching responsibility for product safety and quality lies with the Executive\nBoard, which has assigned the goals and tasks to the Head of Quality Management. Our\nQuality Department is responsible for the further development of our quality\nmanagement system, issues company-wide regulations and regularly checks compliance\nwith them. The quality manual and the quality policy describe the core of our actions and\nare publicly available.\nGuidelines and processes ensure both our product safety and product development and\nregulate the handling of possible defects at appropriate escalation levels. Our Head of\nQuality Management regularly informs the Executive Board about significant\ndevelopments and possible quality incidents that could be classified as critical.\nIn fiscal 2023, no significant quality defects were identified that had a material impact on\nthe health and safety of our customers.\n66\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nΩ Key figures of supplier relations\nDue to the high value added contribution in the supply chain, the procurement process is\nof high importance for AIXTRON's long-term success. We do not manufacture mechanical\nand electrical systems and components ourselves, but focus on development,\nconfiguration and final assembly.\nWe place a high value on working in partnership with our suppliers. This is expressed, for\nexample, through development partnerships in which we jointly develop components and\nassemblies with suppliers. Decisive factors for the selection of suppliers are primarily\nquality, manufacturing competence, delivery reliability, and price.\nFurthermore, we require compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the provisions\nof our supplier manual. In addition, we demand that international minimum standards in\nthe area of sustainability, such as the core labor standards of the International Labor\nOrganization (ILO), are met. We do not tolerate the use of conflict minerals within the\nsupply chain.\nWe currently work with 1,385 suppliers from 28 countries (2022: 1,202 suppliers from 28\ncountries).\nThe risk analysis process as part of the compliance program for the protection of human\nrights and the environment in the supply chain, which is based on the German Supply\nChain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), is carried out at AIXTRON in a multi-stage process and\nuses the methodology of the LkSG, in which a large number of quantitative and\nqualitative data sources are used to assess human rights and environmental risks.\nThe aim of the multi-stage process is to identify and prioritise risks in the company's own\nbusiness area, at direct suppliers and, in the event of substantiated knowledge, at indirect\nsuppliers at an early stage. The structured prioritisation enables a structured filtering out\nof risk-free business areas and suppliers as well as a focus on a more in-depth\nexamination of critical business areas and suppliers. The process enables AIXTRON to\nderive effective and appropriate preventive and remedial measures for prioritised risks or\nrisk areas.\n17 supplier audits had been conducted in the current reporting year 2023 (2022: 32\naudits)\nWe encourage our suppliers to establish management systems in the areas of quality,\nenergy and environment, risk management, data security, sustainability and social and\nlabour law standards.\nThe cooperation extends to suppliers, e.g. from the mechanical and plant engineering\nsector, and the electrical engineering sector, but also engineering service providers as\nwell as suppliers of technical gases or even energy suppliers. AIXTRON is an international\ncompany but still has local roots.\n67\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nKey data supplier 2023 2022 Δ\nOrder-Volume in EUR Mio. 490 313 177\nNumber of Supplier 1,385 1,202 183\nNumber of Countries 28 28 0\nNumber of Supplier Audits 17 32 -15\nPrior-year figures adjusted\nDespite global purchasing, local value creation plays a very important role for us. The\nreason for this is, among other things, the high technical demands on our suppliers and\nthe short communication channels. In Germany, for example, 53% (2022: 59%) of the\npurchasing volume is procured. The decisive factor for the selection is always that the\nsupplier meets our high-quality requirements, has the necessary manufacturing expertise,\nand offers competitive prices.\n68\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nAssociations and initiatives\nWe are involved in a variety of organizations and associations to further promote\necologically sustainable development and resource efficiency in photonics and\nsemiconductor technology. We are a founding member of Photonics21, now a Private\nPublic Partnership (PPP) with the European Commission and the International Solid State\nLighting Alliance (ISA) in China, and actively promote their further development.\nCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) / MSCI\nSince 2010, as part of our participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), we have\nreported once a year on the environmental impact of our business activities and our\ncorporate strategy to reduce CO emissions. In this way, AIXTRON promotes\n2\ntransparency for investors, companies, political decision-makers, and the media.\nAIXTRON achieved a D rating in the current reporting year 2023. In the MSCI rating, we\nwere able to keep the score on high level AA.\nPart of the national initiative „Energy-Efficiency-Network“\nSince 2016, we have been involved in the \"Energy Efficiency Network\" as a founding\nmember together with five other companies in the Aachen region. The aim of the\nnetwork is to identify and realize economic energy-saving potential in companies. In\nrecent years, more than 60,000 megawatt hours of energy have already been saved,\navoiding more than 18,000 tons of CO emissions. AIXTRON has also been able to\n2\nleverage the benefits of the network, with its quarterly meetings, for its energy and\nclimate footprint. In 2022, we renewed our membership in the Energy Efficiency\nNetwork and plan to continue our participation in the coming years. The network is part\nof the nationwide \"Energy Efficiency Networks\" initiative launched by the German\ngovernment and leading German industry associations and organizations. The goal of\nthe initiative was to save up to 75 PJ of primary energy or 5 million tons of GHG\nemissions by 2020 through the initiation and implementation of around 500 new energy\nefficiency company networks. In September 2020, the German Federal Ministry for\nEconomic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) commissioned the continuation of the project until\n2025, now under the title \"Initiative Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Networks\".\nBy the end of 2025, the initiative aims to establish 350 new networks, saving nine to\neleven terawatt hours of final energy and five to six million tons of GHG emissions.\n69\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023\nCorporate Governance\nMemberships in organizations and associations\nHeadquarters of\norganization/\nOrganizations/associations Function/committee Thematic focus association\nISA, International Solid State Founding member Promoting sustainable development and application of LED solid state Shanghai, China\nLighting Alliance lighting.\nResponsible Minerals Initiative Active member of the Identification of all worldwide melts aimed at ensuring responsible mineral Alexandria, USA\n“Smelter Engagement procurement by the companies.\nTeam” for Europe\nand Africa\nDGKK, Deutsche Gesellschaft Member Promoting research, teaching and technology in crystal growth, crystal Erlangen, Germany\nfür Kristallwachstum und breeding, and epitaxy.\nKristallzüchtung e.V.\nDPG, Deutsche Physikalische Supporting member Promoting contacts and dialog in physics and industry with a focus on Bad Honnef, Germany\nGesellschaft in Industry and training physicists during their studies.

The consolidated non-financial statement is included in\nthe separate AIXTRON sustainability report 2023 and consists of the disclosures marked\ntherein with an omega sign (\"Ω\").\nResponsibilities of Management\nManagement of AIXTRON is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated non-\nfinancial statement in accordance with Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e\nHGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU)\n2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on the\nestablishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and the\nDelegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own interpretation of the\nwording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts\nadopted thereunder as set out in section „EU Taxonomy” of the consolidated non-\nfinancial statement.\nThis responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial\nreporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial\ndisclosures of the group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore,\nmanagement is responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable\nthe preparation of a consolidated non-financial statement that is free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording\nand terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which\nclarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has\ndisclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts\nadopted thereunder in section „EU Taxonomy“ of the consolidated non-financial\nstatement. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the\nimmanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal\nconformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n1\nThe English language text below is a translation provided for information purposes only.

The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the\nprofessional judgment of the assurance practitioner.\nIn the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the\nfollowing assurance procedures and other activities\n(cid:17)8 Inquiries of employees responsible for the materiality analysis at Group level to\ngain an understanding of the approach used to identify material topics and\ncorresponding reporting boundaries of AIXTRON.

We were also\nable to make further major progress in the area of sustainability & ESG (environmental,\nsocial, and corporate governance).\nIn 2022, AIXTRON was able to increase the share of taxonomy-aligned revenues to 58% of\ntotal revenues of EUR 463 million (2021: 57%). Thus, with EUR 271 million in taxonomy-\naligned revenues, the majority of AIXTRON's business activities were ecologically\nsustainable in the sense of the EU taxonomy (2021: 243 million). In the previous year, we\nvoluntarily reported on the taxonomy alignment of our business activities in accordance\nwith the new EU taxonomy regulation for the first time.\nIn our core business of equipment technologies for compound semiconductors, we\ncontinue to invest substantially in research and development. We are currently in the\nprocess of completely renewing our system portfolio: In the third quarter, we presented\nour new product platform G10-SiC, a significant innovation for the production of\ncomponents for power electronics based on silicon carbide (SiC). In the future, SiC\ntechnology will play a decisive role in the field of electromobility, among other things —\nboth in the electric drive train and in the expansion of the necessary high-performance\ncharging infrastructure. In January 2023 we publicly presented our new G10-AsP to the\nworld; Among other things, it paves the way for the next generation of high-resolution\nMicro LED displays, which are considered to be particularly energy-efficient. In this way,\nwe serve the current megatrends of sustainability, electrification and digitization, and\nhelp to bring technologies to the market that offer an improved CO balance.\n2\nOur focus on sustainable future technologies is also reflected in our EU aligned operating\nexpenses (OpEX)1 and capital expenditures (CapEx)1. We were able to increase the high\nproportion of taxonomy-aligned operating expenses (OpEx)1 from EUR 43 million (72%) in\n2021 to EUR 45 million (73%) in the reporting year. The taxonomy-aligned capital\nexpenditures (CapEx) has also improved again and has almost doubled in the reporting\nperiod — from EUR 8 million (39%) in 2021 to EUR 14 million (38%).\nWide-band-gap (WBG) Power semiconductors based on gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon\ncarbide (SiC) form the basis for the energy-efficient power electronics of the future.\nMicro LEDs enable the next generation of displays and laser diodes for data\ncommunication bring decisive advantages in the further digitization of our world. In\naddition, we are looking at other exciting technologies in the field of renewable energies\n(e.g. solar cells).\nOur sustainable business model is also confirmed by positive ESG ratings. For example,\nour current MSCI rating is AA (2021: A).\nWe also continuously strive to improve in the area of energy efficiency and directly\ncontrollable CO emissions. AIXTRON has been climate neutral since 2019. For several\n2\nyears we have been successfully using waste heat generated in our laboratories at our\ncentral location in Herzogenrath and using it specifically for heating the building. At the\nend of 2022, a new heat pump was also installed, which is expected to save most of the\nremaining gas consumption. Since 2019, we have been sourcing electricity exclusively\nfrom renewable energies at our European locations and also in the USA. In 2022,\nAIXTRON also replaced the existing lighting systems at its locations with state-of-the-art\nLED lighting technology in order to further reduce energy consumption.\n4\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nOur employees are the key to our company's success. Their creativity and problem-\nsolving skills, their commitment and their understanding of the industry in combination\nwith an extraordinary willingness to perform are still the foundation of AIXTRON. In 2022\nwe were able to add more than 230 highly qualified colleagues. We were able to further\nincrease the diversity and internationality of our workforce: We already employ people\nfrom around 50 nations (2021: 42).\nAt the same time, we are very focused on developing our employees. We are therefore\nvery proud that we managed to more than double the learning hours per employee last\nyear. In 2022 they amounted to 32.8 hours per employee (2021: 13.3 hours).\nOur board members Dr. Jochen Linck, Dr. Felix Grawert and Dr. Christian Danninger (f.l.t.r.).\nOur focus is also on the careful and responsible further development of our strong,\nAIXTRON-specific corporate culture. This also includes our awareness that we have a\nresponsibility towards society. With our social and community activities, we therefore\nsupport initiatives and institutions that improve people's lives. In the course of the 2022\nreporting year, we donated a total of EUR 50,000 to support war refugees from Ukraine in\nour region. The German Red Cross, the joint aid campaign of the RWTH Aachen and the\nuniversity hospital as well as the emergency aid Ukraine of the \"Aktion Deutschland Hilft\"\nwere considered.\nEffective and efficient corporate governance is the basis and sets the framework for our\nfinancial and non-financial success. Since many years, we have had highly developed\ncorporate governance systems in place as the basis for good corporate management. For\ndetails, we refer to the further explanations in this report or in our annual report.\nIn this sustainability report we give you an overview of our sustainability strategy and its\nconcrete implementation. We would like to present the results we have achieved to you\nand also show you what we are working on today and in the future.\n5\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nThe Executive Board of AIXTRON SE\nDr. Felix Grawert Dr. Christian Danninger Dr. Jochen Linck\nChairman of the Board Member of the Board Member of the Board\n6\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\n7\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nAbout this report\nΩ\nWith this sustainability report, AIXTRON documents the ecological and social\nperformance and the progress made in implementing its sustainability goals for the 2022\nreporting year. This should make it clear to our stakeholders how ecological and social\ngoals and measures have contributed to the company's success.\nYou can find the economic data and performance of AIXTRON for the 2022 financial year\nin our annual report.\nThe reporting period corresponds to the 2022 financial year, i.e. the period from January\n01, 2022 to December 31, 2022.\nThe report covers the following locations and subsidiaries of the AIXTRON Group. These\nessentially include:\n• AIXTRON SE, Germany • AIXTRON Korea Co. Ltd., Korea\n• AIXTRON Ltd., Great Britain • AIXTRON China Ltd., China\n• AIXTRON, Inc., USA • AIXTRON Taiwan Co. Ltd., Taiwan\n• AIXTRON K.K., Japan • AIXTRON, Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia\nAs of December 31, 2022, AIXTRON has one production site and one research/\ndevelopment site in Herzogenrath and one in Cambridge (UK) as well as sales and service\nsites in the USA and Asia. The vast majority of our employees work at our location in\nGermany and a considerably smaller number in Great Britain. The focus of the reporting is\ntherefore on these two locations.\n8\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nUtilization in Size Thereof Share of\nMain site Country 2022 (approx.) biodiverse Share of m² employee\nCompany\nHerzogenrath headquarters, 60,304 m2\nR&D, production\nGermany\nEurope Europe Europe\nHerzogenrath Production 7,875 m2 29.7% 94.8% 81.3%\nR&D, production,\nCambridge UK 5,146 m2\ncustomer service\nSales, customer USA USA USA\nSanta Clara USA 491 m2\nservice 0.0% 0.6% 3.4%\nSales, customer\nHwasung South Korea 1,151 m2\nservice\nSales, customer\nShanghai China 594 m2\nservice\nSales, customer Asia Asia Asia\nHsinchu Taiwan 677 m2\nservice 0.0% 4.6% 15.3%\nSales, customer\nTokio Japan 364 m2\nservice\nKulim Malaysia Customer service 766 m2\nOverview of the locations per country including use, size, distribution of employees and distribution of biodiverse areas by region.

That includes all\ngenders. The same applies to similar terms such as participants, representatives, etc.\n9\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nΩ Framework and Reporting\nThe sustainability report is prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting\nStandards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The table at the end of the report\nprovides information on the assignment of the content to the requirements of the GRI\nframework. On our AIXTRON website under the menu item \"Sustainability,\" you will find\naccompanying explanations of the information and projects presented in this report.\nWith the report, we primarily want to give our interest groups (stakeholders) the most\ncomprehensive possible picture of the non-financial aspects and key figures of our\nbusiness activities. Individual key figures were recorded for the first time in the 2022\nreporting year and included in this report. If in individual cases, we do not have any data\nfrom previous years, it is not possible to compare these key figures with previous years. In\nthis case, this is indicated by a corresponding note.\nThe requirements of the German CSR Directive Implementation Act oblige AIXTRON to\npublish a non-financial statement. With our separate non-financial report, we meet the\nrequirements that arise for us from Section 315b (1-3) HGB.\nAll sections of text, tables, and graphics in the sustainability report that are assigned to\nthe non-financial report are marked with an omega symbol Ω. Therefore, not all\ninformation contained in this report is also a mandatory part of the separate non-\nfinancial statement. References to information in the management report are part of the\nnon-financial statement.\nAccording to Section 289c (3) HGB, we are obliged to examine topics for their “double\nmateriality”. Dual materiality requires disclosures on non-financial aspects to be made as\nsoon as the following criteria are met:\n1. The information is necessary to understand the course of business, the business result,\nand the position of the company.\n2. The information makes it possible to understand how the company's business activities\naffect non-financial aspects.\nWe checked the issues identified for this double materiality. The topics that fit this\ndefinition are also marked in the report by an omega sign Ω. These topics are assigned to\nthe respective chapters in this report. In terms of Sections 289c Paragraphs 2 and 3, 315c\nHGB, no “material risks” have been identified either with regard to our business activities\nor with regard to our business relationships, products, and services that have or will have\n“very likely serious negative effects”.\nThe non-financial information and key figures on our sustainability activities given in this\nreport were subjected to an independent review with “limited assurance” by KPMG AG\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Duesseldorf (Germany) using the relevant auditing\nstandards for sustainability reporting (ISAE 3000 Revised).\n10\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nΩ Dialogue with our stakeholders\nWe maintain trusting and long-term partnerships with our stakeholders. In doing so, it is\nimportant to us - just as in our company to each other - that we treat each other in a\nspirit of partnership, respectful and constructive. We see ourselves as part of this society.\nThat is why we are committed to community and social projects – particularly in the\nregion where our headquarters are located.\nThe key interest groups for AIXTRON are:\n• Customers • State and politics\n• Employees • Media\n• Capital market participants • Science and Research\n• Delivery\nThe identification of the most important stakeholders and their interests are crucial for a\nsuccessful stakeholder dialogue (see also the chapter on sustainable corporate\nmanagement and sustainability strategy / materiality analysis). The interest groups were\ncategorized and prioritized based on the following criteria:\n• Interests of the stakeholders\n• Stakeholder Influence\n• Stakeholder expectations of AIXTRON\n• Dependence of stakeholders on AIXTRON\n• Value for AIXTRON to get in touch with this stakeholder\nWe regularly reflect on the process for identifying the most important stakeholders and\nthe relevant topics and adjust them where necessary.\n11\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nForeword\nStakeholder Topics of dialog Forms of dialog\nCapital market • Business performance • Sustainability • Roadshows and • Annual General\n• Product innovations • Strategy (telephone) Meeting\n• Application conferences • Sustainability\npossibilities • Quarterly reporting reporting\n• Annual financial • Company visits\nstatements and\nannual report\nCustomers • Product quality and • Human rights • Audits • Product requirements\nsafety • Compliance • Expert support • Joint developments\n• Sustainable • AIXTRON after-sales with customers\ntechnologies • Fairs and conferences\n• Product energy\nefficiency\nSuppliers and • Product quality and • Responsible • Supplier evaluation • Workshops\nbusiness safety purchasing • Purchasing principles • Audits\n• Environmental • Compliance with\npartners\nprotection AIXTRON’s standards\nEmployees • Health and safety • Compensation and • Intranet • Employee survey\n• Career advancement benefits • Staff meetings • Operational\n• Co-determination • Work-life balance / • Internal publications improvement\n• Training opportunities parental leave • Employee survey suggestion scheme\n• Diversity & equal • Training and employee\nopportunities appraisals\nScience and • Development of new • Networking of • Teaching assignment • University group visits\nuniversity technologies industry and research • Research projects • Allocation of doctoral\n• Promotion of research • Recruitment / PhD • Fairs & conferences positions\nand teaching students\nMedia • Innovation and • AIXTRON as employer • Interviews • Company receptions\nrepresentatives technologies • Finance • Press releases\n• Semiconductor\ntechnology\nGovernment • Eco-efficiency • Economic and labor • Meetings and • Participation in forums\nand politicians • Innovation and policy committees and events\ntechnology promotion\nMost important stakeholders, topics and forms of dialogue\n12\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\n13\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nSustainable corporate management and\nsustainability strategy\nΩ Who we are and what we do\nThe AIXTRON Group (“AIXTRON” or “the Company”) is a leading provider of deposition\nequipment for the semiconductor industry. The company was founded in 1983 and is\nbased in Herzogenrath (Aachen region) with branches and representative offices in\nEurope, the USA, and Asia. At the end of 2022, we employed a total of 940 people\n(headcount). Since 2020, AIXTRON has been listed in the MDAX in addition to the TecDAX.\nAIXTRON's business activities include the development, production, and installation of\nsystems for the deposition of complex semiconductor materials, the development of\nprocess technologies, consulting, and training as well as customer support.\nOur products are used by customers worldwide to manufacture high-performance\ncomponents for power electronic and optoelectronic applications based on compound\nsemiconductors. These devices are used in a variety of innovative applications,\ntechnologies and industries. These include, for example, Micro LED and display\ntechnologies, data transmission, communication, signaling and lighting technology,\nsensors and power electronics based on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), as\nwell as many other demanding high-tech applications.\nIn the 2022 reporting year, we\ninvested EUR 58 million (2021: EUR\n57 million) in research and\ndevelopment with revenues of EUR\n463 million (2021: EUR 429 million).\nThis corresponds to around 13% of\nour revenues, with an equity ratio of\n74% (2021: 80%). Asia accounted for\nthe lion's share of our revenues at\nalmost 68% (2021: 70%), followed by\nEurope at 14% (2021: 20%) and North\nAmerica at 18% (2021: 10%).\nOur self-image and our values\nIn addition to economic success, our business activities also focus on ecological and social\nchallenges. Sustainability is a prerequisite for long-term economic success.\n14\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nAs a supplier to pioneering key industry, we conduct our business prudently and\nresponsibly, taking into account the interests of key stakeholders. The aim is to act\nsustainably at all levels of the value chain and to further promote sustainability in the\ncompany.\nActing responsibly is one of four corporate values at AIXTRON and is therefore a central\npart of our corporate culture. The Board of Directors and our managers have a particular\nresponsibility and act as role models.\nAs a future-oriented technology company, efficient and resource-optimized management\nhas always been part of our core business. Thanks to our technologies and systems,\nsemiconductors are becoming more and more efficient and resource-saving, which\nincreases the efficiency of a large number of end products.\nThis applies to applications from areas such as energy supply, electromobility,\nentertainment electronics, or communication. Our products thus contribute to reducing\nnot only our own ecological footprint but also that of our customers and especially that of\nthe end consumers in these areas (see also the chapter on innovations as a competitive\nfactor).\nseulav\nruO\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nExcellent.\nLeading position through goal-oriented action.\nForward thinking.\nProvide impulses for the future instead of following them.\nOpen minded.\nCommunicate openly for a healthy corporate culture.\nResponsible.\nSetting a good example for sustainable success.\n15\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Our sustainability strategy\nIn recent years, sustainability has been increasingly anchored in our company as an\nimportant principle of corporate management. The cornerstone for our current strategy\nwas laid in 2018. Two years later, concrete sustainability goals were defined and\nincentivized by the Supervisory Board and Board of Directors. In doing so, we have also\ngiven non-financial goals greater weight.\nAn important goal as part of our sustainability strategy was to become carbon neutral,\nwhich we achieved in 2019. We obtain our electricity from renewable energies and\ncompensate for all unavoidable CO emissions through climate protection projects. The\n2\ngoal of climate neutrality was thus achieved much earlier than the goals set by the federal\ngovernment for industry.\nScope 1&2; AIXTRON Index 100 = 7.411 t CO2e in 2015; Industries Index 100 = Climate targets BMUV (284 Mio. t CO2e in 1990)\nSince 2021 we have also been reporting on the upstream value chain (Scope 3). This\nanalysis was further optimized in the current reporting year. We also determined the\nvalues for the previous year according to the new, stricter criteria and adjusted them\nretrospectively.\nThis corresponds to our claim to continuously improve our sustainability activities, the\nassociated guidelines, standards and programs. In this way, we can better meet the needs\nand expectations of our stakeholders.\nAgainst this background, we have defined five priority topics in our sustainability strategy.\nAIXTRON sustainability strategy\nEnvironment and Employees, Respect for Society and social Combating\necology worker safety, human rights affairs corruption and\nhealth protection bribery\nThe five core topics of the AIXTRON sustainability strategy\n16\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nSome of these topics were defined in our “Sustainability Policy” and are also based on the\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\nThe SDGs we support relate to the following goals:\n• No poverty\n• Health and well-being\n• Quality education\n• Gender equality\n• Affordable and clean energy\n• Decent work and economic growth\n• Industry, innovation and infrastructure\n• Sustainable consumption and production\n• Measures for climate protection\n• Life on land\nThese goals serve as orientation for our daily and strategic work.\nThe SDGs supported by AIXTRON relate to the above goals\n17\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Identification of material issues\nIn 2020, we systematically created a materiality analysis for the first time, thereby\ncreating a comprehensive process that evaluates economic, ecological and social issues\nthat are important to us. The focus is on aspects that have a significant impact on the\ncompany. To this end, internal experts and employees who are in constant contact with\nour stakeholders were surveyed. In 2022, we further optimized our process and already\naligned it with the future Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In\nparticular, both the inside-out and the outside-in perspectives were taken into account\nwhen deriving key subject areas.\nWe were also able to cover the external perspective through a comprehensive internal\nsurvey, which was based on the expertise and many years of experience of our\nemployees. As a result, five topic clusters were defined, which we have shown in the\noverview below. In the 2022 reporting year, we reviewed this allocation and made the\nnecessary changes. The following two overviews illustrate the importance of the\nrespective topic complexes and their chronological classification - across all stakeholders.\nAIXTRON materiality analysis 2022\n18\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nThe following overview shows the stakeholders' assessment of the respective time\nhorizon of the subject areas considered to be material.\nData protection and information\nsecurity\nTransparency of Financial\nInformation\nCorporate Governance and\nLong-term economic success\nCompliance\nAttracting and retaining qualified\nSustainable products and innovation\nworkers\nCustomer relationships Human rights\nCustomer focus Operational excellence\nRisk management Workers rights\nSupplier relationships Employee satisfaction\nEmployee promotion and\nResilience to external influences ...\n-development\n1-2 years 3-5 years > 5 years\nIn the following overview, the subject areas considered essential by the stakeholders are\nassigned to the three overarching subject areas of environment, social affairs, and\ncorporate management.\nEnvironment Social Corporate governance\nSustainable products and innovation Human rights Long-term economic success\nData protection and information\nCarbon footprint Workers rights\nsecurity\nTransparency of Financial\nEmployee satisfaction\nInformation\nEmployee promotion and Corporate Governance and\n-development Compliance\nAttracting and retaining qualified\nCustomer relationships\nworkers\nCustomer focus\nRisk management\nOperational excellence\nSupplier relationships\nResilience to external influences\n19\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSustainable corporate management and sustainability strategy\nΩ Organizational anchoring\nThe Board of Directors of AIXTRON SE bears overall responsibility for the topic of\nsustainability. It is advised by the ESG and Sustainability department and decides on\nimportant sustainability issues. The respective departments and branches of AIXTRON SE\nare responsible for implementing the goals and projects decided by the Board of\nDirectors. The sustainability working group consists of those responsible for the\nrespective topic, e.g. B. innovation, technology, energy management, human resources,\nworks council, compliance, quality assurance or purchasing. The aim is to develop\nrelevant sustainability topics along the corporate strategy, to strengthen awareness of\nsustainable management, and to anchor it in all areas of the company. Within the\nworking group, those responsible regularly report actively on the progress of individual\nprojects in the company and drive them forward. The cornerstones of our sustainability\nmanagement for all units of AIXTRON SE are formally and bindingly laid down in our CSR\nguidelines.\nBoard of Directors of AIXTRON SE\nis advised by...\nManager ESG & Sustainability\nSustainability Working Group\nconsists of responsible persons from the specialist departments …\nInnovation Board member Compliance\nTechnology Human resource Quality control\nEnergy management Work council Purchasing\nGoal\nDevelopment and implementation of sustainability topics\nStrengthen awareness of sustainable management\n20\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\n21\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nEnvironment\nWe see the protection of the environment as a key factor in the sustainability of our\nbusiness model and align our actions accordingly. In addition, we are in close contact with\nour customers and suppliers. Our innovative technologies and products, on which our\nsuccess is based and whose efficiency and performance convince our customers\nworldwide, make a decisive contribution.\nTechnology and climate protection\nUsing efficiencies, saving natural resources and\nthus driving current megatrends forward -\nAIXTRON actively supports the topics of\ndecarbonization, digitization and electromobility\nwith its products. Our systems are therefore the\nkey to numerous future technologies that help to\nsignificantly reduce CO . With our innovations in\n2\nthe field of power electronics based on silicon\ncarbide and gallium nitride as well as\noptoelectronics, we support the development\ntowards a sustainable and networked society.\nDr. Felix Grawert · Chairman of the Board (CEO)\nOur customers benefit from forward-looking solutions that save costs, conserve\nresources, and are energy-efficient in equal measure. Our customers include companies\nfrom the areas of electromobility (drive trains, charging infrastructure), renewable\nenergies (network circuits), IT infrastructure (power supply), consumer electronics (3D\nsensors, fast chargers) as well as data transmission (fiber optic networks) and\ntelecommunications (5G network).\nWe also make a significant contribution to digital progress in the areas of display\ntechnology (mini and Micro LEDs), lighting and UV radiation for disinfection/hygiene.\nComponents for a variety of innovative applications, technologies and industries are\nmanufactured on AIXTRON systems.\n22\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nHighest precision in the manufacture of power electronics\nAs a technology leader, we have been shaping the further development of power\nelectronics and their manufacturing processes for more than 30 years.\nPower electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN)\nand silicon carbide (SiC) are significantly more\nenergy-efficient than conventional silicon-based\npower electronics: If GaN components are used in\nthe power supply of large data centers, for\nexample, 30 to 40% of the energy losses that\noccur during conversion can be saved . The global\nIT infrastructure has a significant impact on the\nclimate. It is currently already responsible for\naround 3% of global CO emissions and is\n2\nbecoming increasingly important in view of the\nconstantly growing amount of data.\nProf. Dr. Michael Heuken\nVice President Advanced Technologies\nOur technologies are at the heart of sustainable power electronics and thus support\nglobal efforts to combat climate change.\n23\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nΩ EU Taxonomy\nWith the Action Plan on Sustainable Growth, the EU Commission aims to make the\neconomic and financial system in the EU more sustainable. Climate neutrality should be\nachieved by 2050, i.e. the same amount of CO emissions should then be avoided or\n2\neliminated as is emitted. The core of this action plan is the EU taxonomy regulation, a\nstandardized classification system for sustainable economic activities. It defines six\nenvironmental goals:\nThe sustainable\nThe protection\nuse and Prevention and\nThe transition and restoration\nClimate Adaptation to protection of reduction of\nto a circular of biodiversity\nprotection climate change water and environmental\neconomy and\nmarine pollution\necosystems\nresources\nAccording to EU taxonomy guidelines, economic activities are “environmentally\nsustainable” if they\n• make a significant contribution to achieving one or more of the six environmental goals\nmentioned,\n• do not significantly harm the achievement of the five other EU environmental targets\n(“Do no significant harm”; DNSH), and\n• comply with minimum regulations for occupational safety and human rights (“minimum\nsafeguards”)\nTechnical assessment criteria are used to assess whether an economic activity makes a\nsignificant contribution to one of the goals and does not significantly impair the\nachievement of the other five goals. Criteria are currently only available for the first two\nEU environmental goals (climate protection/adaptation to climate change). Therefore,\ninformation only needs to be provided on these two targets for the 2022 financial year.\n• Activities are “eligible” for taxonomy if they can be assigned to taxonomy criteria.\n• Activities are “taxonomy-aligned” (aligned) if the taxonomy-eligible activities also meet\nthe criteria.\nAgainst the background of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, we are reporting in the 2022\nfinancial year on the taxonomy-eligible (eligible) and taxonomy-aligned (aligned) share of\nrevenues, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) of our economic\nactivities.\n24\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nΩ Method\nIn the 2021 financial year, a project to implement the taxonomy requirements in relation\nto the EU environmental goals 1. Climate change mitigation and 2. Climate change\nadaptation was started. The project team, consisting of experts from different areas, first\nidentified the economic sector “Manufacture of machines for other specific economic\nsectors a. n.g.” (NACE Code 28.99) as applicable to AIXTRON. Subsequently, our economic\nactivities were assigned to the relevant taxonomy criteria and interviews and workshops\nwere conducted with the respective contact persons and experts from the responsible\ndepartments.\nThe aim of the discussions was to check whether the economic activities can be assigned\nto taxonomy criteria (eligibility check) and whether they actually meet the corresponding\ntechnical taxonomy criteria (alignment check). The assessments of the experts were\ndocumented and corresponding evidence and evidence were examined.\nThe analysis has been updated for the 2022 financial year, in particular taking into\naccount the interpretation of the taxonomy specifications. The analysis took into account\naspects of materiality and cost/benefit considerations. AIXTRON has identified the\nfollowing activities as taxonomy-eligible with regard to EU environmental goal 1:\n• 3.1 Manufacture of renewable energy technologies\n• 3.6 Manufacture of other low-CO technologies\n2\n• 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient devices\n• 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies\n• 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\n25\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nThe set of criteria “Production of other low-CO technologies” is of particular relevance\n2\nfor the supplier industry in mechanical and plant engineering. This set of criteria includes\neconomic activities that produce technologies that aim to achieve significant savings in\nlife-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and are proven to achieve them compared to the\nbest performing alternative technology available on the market. Unlike criteria sets 3.1,\n7.3, 7.3 and 7.7, criteria set 3.6 contains several terms that require interpretation, which\nare defined below.\nFor the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities within the meaning of\nCriteria Set 3.6, those technologies were identified from AIXTRON's technology portfolio\nthat shows low CO emissions in their application. As a result, only those technologies\n2\nthat lead to significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions were classified as both\ntaxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned. Against this background, both our taxonomy-\neligible and our taxonomy-aligned revenues correspond, as do CapEx and OpEx. The\nreduction in greenhouse gas emissions must be significant. However, a minimum value is\nnot specified.\nIt can be assumed that the purpose pursued with the \"EU Action Plan on Financing\nSustainable Growth\" is to focus on technological leaps rather than efficiency increases\nwithin the existing system: A saving of 20% should regularly be significant and thus a\nsignificant one contribute to climate protection. AIXTRON has set this value as the\nminimum value for significant savings in CO emissions. A reference technology is the\n2\ntechnology that dominates the market and not a possibly very efficient niche technology\nwith only a very small market share. With regard to the reference standard, we therefore\nonly used this reference technology for the evaluation.\n26\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nThe analysis of the taxonomy conformity was carried out as follows:\n• Substantial Contribution: Compliance with the technical assessment criteria was\nchecked individually for each taxonomy-eligible business activity.\n• Do not significant harm (DNSH): DNSH compliance with the EU environmental goals 2.\nAdaptation to climate change, 3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine\nresources and 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems were\nassessed for the Herzogenrath and Cambridge locations. The DNSH conformity with\nregard to the EU environmental goals 4. Circular economy and 5. Pollution prevention\nand control were assessed at the group level and at the level of the business activity.\n• Minimum Safeguards: A Group-wide approach to ensuring the Minimum Safeguards\nrequirements was pursued, which appropriately takes into account the risk situation,\nthe circumstances, and the context of AIXTRON. In external relations, we limit ourselves\nto the upstream supply chain as part of a risk-based approach. We consider the\ndownstream value chain (\"business relationships\") to be uncritical in this regard.\nCountry and product-specific aspects in particular were taken into account as part of\nthe risk-based approach. Due to the focused business model and the demanding high-\ntech requirements, AIXTRON relies on a relatively small number of key suppliers, most\nof whom are based in the region. In the 2022 financial year, for example, more than\n98% of the total order volume came from suppliers in OECD countries, which are\ngenerally considered to be low-risk. A detailed risk analysis was carried out for the\nremaining suppliers from potentially risky countries. These suppliers are essentially\nlocal needs that are not strategically relevant to the company. AIXTRON regularly\ninforms suppliers about current requirements. The Minimum Safeguards requirements\nare ensured using the existing compliance management structures (e.g. sustainability\nguidelines, global standards of employment, code of ethics, management system for\nconflict minerals, obligations on human rights within the framework of the general\nterms and conditions, and the supplier manual, supplier audits, whistleblowing\nmechanism).\nΩ Criteria for climate protection and adaptation to climate change\nAs part of this analysis, the following taxonomy-eligible and at the same time taxonomy-\naligned economic activities were identified at AIXTRON, which make a significant\ncontribution to environmental goal 1. Climate change mitigation.\n27\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nProduction of other low-CO technologies (3.6)\n2\nAIXTRON develops, produces and sells systems for the deposition of compound\nsemiconductors.

Solar cells made from compound semiconductors are often\nused for high-tech applications such as B. used in space travel.\nWithin the framework of the analysis carried out, no economic activities were identified\nthat make a significant contribution to environmental goal 2. Climate change adaptation.\nΩ Compliance with the „Do no significant harm” (DNSH) criteria\nWith regard to the EU environmental target 2. Climate change adaptation, there are no\nindications that AIXTRON activities increase the adverse effects of the current and\nexpected future climate on AIXTRON itself or on people, nature, or assets. The AIXTRON\nproduction sites are not subject to any significant physical climate risks.\nThe criteria for the EU environmental target 3. Sustainable use and protection of water\nand marine resources essentially relates to legal and official requirements that AIXTRON\nis obliged to comply with. Water is not used to any significant extent in the production\nprocess at AIXTRON. The systems are to be kept away from water.\nWith regard to environmental goal 4. Transition to a circular economy, there are general\nrequirements such as long usability, easy maintenance or dismantling. Most of the\ncomponents are designed for very long service life, can be recycled and still have a\nmonetary value at the end of their useful life (e.g. steel, stainless steel, aluminium,\ncopper, electronics).\n29\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nWith regard to the EU environmental goal 5. Pollution prevention and control, there are\nno indications that AIXTRON is violating the corresponding specifications. AIXTRON does\nnot manufacture, place on the market or use substances of very high concern in terms of\nthe taxonomy specifications.\nWith regard to the EU environmental goal 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity\nand ecosystems, environmental impact assessments and assessments are carried out\nwhere there is a corresponding requirement.\nInformation on compliance with the minimum requirements with regard to occupational\nsafety and human rights can be found in the \"Occupational health and safety\" chapter\nand in the \"Conflict minerals\" chapter in this report and on the AIXTRON website in the\nsustainability section.\n30\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nΩ Definition of revenue, CapEx and OpEx\nTo determine the key figures (KPIs) to be reported, the taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-\naligned net revenues, investments (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) are set in\nrelation to the total net revenues, the total investments or the total operating expenses\nto be taken into account according to the taxonomy specifications. The definition of the\nrespective KPI is based on Annex I of the Delegated Act to Article 8 on the content and\npresentation of the information to be disclosed.\nDouble counting is avoided by clearly assigning the taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-\naligned revenues, CapEx and OpEx to a taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned economic\nactivity.\nRevenue within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation is defined as net revenue\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as reported in the\nconsolidated income statement and relates only to fully consolidated subsidiaries.\nFurther information on revenues can be found in the section “development of revenues”\non page 80 of the annual report. The majority of the taxonomy-aligned AIXTRON\nrevenues are attributable to the sale of the systems presented on page 5 and can be\nassigned to taxonomy criteria set 3.6.\nThe calculation of CapEx within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation is carried\nout on a gross basis, i.e. without taking into account revaluations or scheduled or\nunscheduled depreciation. CapEx includes investments in long-term intangible or tangible\nassets as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Further information on CapEx can\nbe found in the investments section on page 94 of the annual report.\n31\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nThe numerator corresponds to that part of the CapEx contained in the denominator that\nrelates to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\nOther CapEx within the meaning of Article 1.1.2.2. b) or c) of the delegated act on Article\n8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (C(2021) 4987 final) of July 6, 2021, does not apply.\nOpEx within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation takes into account non-\ncapitalizable expenses that are recognized in the consolidated income statement. In the\n2022 reporting year, in addition to the expenses for research and development, the\nexpenses for building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance, and repairs\nwere also included, which were considered immaterial in the previous year's report.

The R&D process starts with basic research on materials and then moves\non to processes and procedures. A key result of our research work is our innovative\nproduct portfolio with technology solutions that enable our customers to manufacture\nproducts that save greenhouse gas emissions during their use.\nWe work together with renowned universities, research centers, and industrial partners\naround the world in order to implement demanding projects on a national and\ninternational level in partnership.

For the current report,\nthe analytical instruments used in the previous year were further optimized and the\nvalues determined for 2021 were once more checked and adjusted.\nThe newly determined value for 2021 is 50,258 CO e*. For the year 2022, AIXTRON will\n2\nhave emissions of 53,298 CO e. The value for 2022 as a whole is therefore slightly higher\n2\nthan the values determined for 2021.

We chose the projects because of the positive\nimpact on the environment, climate and residents. The emission savings are regularly\nchecked and confirmed by independent experts. The funding period for the two projects\ncurrently extends to 2023.

The successful conversion to the requirements\nof ISO 50001:2018 was confirmed by the re-certification audit in 2020, which is valid until\n2023.\nΩ Further development of the award-winning energy management concept\nAt our German locations, we work continuously to improve our energy management\nsystems. To do this, we use extensive evaluations with which systems and processes can\nbe controlled and optimized in a targeted manner. In order to improve the evaluation, we\ncontinued the concept of the cloud-based dashboard for the 2022 reporting year by\nimplementing new meters in order to optimize the control technology of the energy\ncenter. The system, consisting of more than 160 electrical meters, has been further\noptimized. The data from these meters is recorded and evaluated centrally every 15\nminutes. In addition to data acquisition, the system offers an extensive determination,\nevaluation, and documentation tool. In this way, targeted measures to reduce CO\n2\nemissions can be initiated and the corresponding progress can be monitored\nimmediately.\nElectricity from renewable energy sources and photovoltaics\nSince 2019, we have been sourcing electricity exclusively from renewable energies at\nour European locations and also in the USA. Due to the small quantities, the purchase of\nelectricity from renewable energy sources in Asian countries has not been economically\nfeasible up to now. We intend to source electricity from renewable energy sources in\nthese regions as well from 2023. In addition, we installed a photovoltaic system at our\nKaiserstrasse location many years ago. 3,293 kWh of electricity generated in 2022 will be\n100% fed into the grid.\n36\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nPractical examples\nDerived from our systematic energy management, we have already initiated and\nimplemented many projects and measures with the aim of sustainably reducing energy\nconsumption. The most important projects of the past year are listed here as examples:\nNew 4-pipe air heat pump compensates for gas consumption\nFor a number of years, we have been successfully using waste heat from the cooling\nprocesses in our laboratories at our central location in Herzogenrath, and using it\nspecifically for heating the building. It has already been possible to save 90 percent of\ngas and 10 percent of electricity consumption. A new 4-pipe air heat pump was installed\nat the end of 2022, which will avoid most of the remaining gas consumption. The device\nis the latest technology available on the market: the combination device can be used for\nboth cold and hot water production. To do this, it uses independent and mutually closed\ncircuits. This enables us to further reduce the footprint of CO emissions that we directly\n2\ncause.\nState-of-the-art lighting technology\ncreates even more energy efficiency\nAIXTRON replaced the existing lighting\nsystems at its worldwide locations with\nthe latest LED lighting technology in\n2022. This will enable us to further\nreduce energy consumption. Since the\ninstallation was carried out gradually\nover the reporting year, it will only be\npossible to compare with previous values\nfrom 2023 on.\n* When calculating the energy and CO2 savings, we were advised by external companies who gave us technical advice with their engineering knowledge and specialist\nknow-how. All calculations were based on a systematic and scientifically sound approach with specific assumptions for the calculations.\n37\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nEnergy saving targets achieved for the fifth year in a row\nIn the past fiscal year, we were able to increase our revenues significantly, which was\naccompanied by a higher demand for electricity. However, thanks to the various energy-\nsaving projects, we were able to mitigate the increase in overall consumption. Energy\nrequirements rose by 5.2% in the past financial year, with energy consumption per\nEUR million in revenues falling by -2.6%.\nOur successes are confirmation and incentive at the same time: Every year we review our\nstatus quo and set ourselves new, ambitious energy-saving targets. At the same time, this\nis also an economic consideration for us, because the lower consumption also reduces\nour costs.\nWe are constantly developing measures to increase energy efficiency. Our goals primarily\nrelate to our research and production sites in Germany and Great Britain.\nThe electricity requirement in 2022 was 12,677,293 kWh higher than in 2021 (10,883,534\nkWh). The reason for this was the continued strong growth in business volume and the\ncontinuing good order situation.\nThe demand for natural gas (426,321 kWh) and district heating (1,973,982 kWh) has\nfallen significantly to a total of 2,400,303 kWh compared to 2021 (3,452,892 kWh). This is\nproof of the effectiveness of our ambitious energy management and our strategy of using\nwaste heat and state-of-the-art heat pumps. In this context, however, it should also be\nnoted that consumption in 2021 was significantly higher than in 2020. This was mainly\ndue to certain COVID protective measures.\n38\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nΩ Power consumption\n(kWh) Energy 2022 2021 Δ\nNatural gas Scope 1 426,321 1,326,842 -67.9%\nElectricity Scope 2 12,677,293 10,883,534 16.5%\nLong distance\nScope 2 1,973,982 2,126,050 -7.2%\nheating\nTotal 15,077,596 14,336,426 5.2%\nEnergy intensity (kWh/EUR Mio.

AIXTRON has made it its goal to reduce this influence to a minimum.\nAvoiding waste has the highest priority, i.e. keeping material consumption and disposal\nquantities as low as possible. In the area of our waste management, separate and safe\ndisposal is therefore very important to us, depending on the type of waste and recycling\nprocess. We record and classify locally the quantities that are recycled or disposed of,\ndistinguishing between hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Residual materials are\nreused whenever possible. Waste is recycled materially or thermally or — if this is not\nfeasible - disposed of properly.\nΩ Disposal of hazardous waste\nHazardous substances and materials are used in the process chambers of our systems and\nsometimes also in the pipelines, which must be disposed of separately. During disposal,\nthe individual components and assemblies are collected in specially secured containers so\nthat the hazardous substances cannot escape. At our European locations, we work\ntogether with local specialist companies who professionally dispose of hazardous waste\nat regular intervals. Wherever possible, e.g. B. in the pipes of the exhaust system, the\nsometimes high-quality materials (e.g. stainless steel) are processed again and then\nreused in the sense of a circular economy. When it comes to exhaust gas cleaning, we use\ncatalytic cleaning processes wherever possible, which largely prevent the accumulation of\nhazardous waste. Our exhaust gas cleaning system completely dispenses with wet-\nchemical processes, so that no contaminated wastewater is produced throughout the\nentire operation.\nThe increased amount of non-hazardous waste in Herzogenrath (D) and Cambridge (UK)\nis due to the increase in production volume.\nHazardous waste (kg) Non-hazardous waste (kg)\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nGermany 1,834 1,834 1,972 76,708 62,380\nUK 2 362 62,532 42,852\nAsia/USA 0 0 34,849 21,504\nTotal 1,836 2,334 174,089 126,736\nHazardous and non-hazardous waste by region.\n40\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nMobility\nDue to the complexity of our systems, it is necessary to provide customers with targeted\nadvice on-site. Systems are developed and optimized jointly in some cases. We also\nsupport our customers in training employees. As a rule, this requires corresponding travel\nactivity by our employees. Most of our customers are based outside of Germany, which\naffects the kilometers traveled and the choice of transport.\nΩ Commuter behavior\nIn the 2022 reporting year, we conducted a survey among all employees on their\ncommuting behavior for the first time. It turned out that 39% of employees come to work\nsustainably: 15% walk or use a bicycle/e-bike, 12% use public transport and 12% rely on\nvehicles with alternative drives - be it hybrid - ( 10%) or purely battery electric vehicles\n(2%). At 61%, however, the majority still uses vehicles with classic combustion engines.\nWe have a total of 15 e-car charging stations and 24 e-bike charging stations on our\ncompany premises in Herzogenrath.\nPublic transport (train)\n36 Car (electric)\nPublic transport 4% 80\n(bus, streetcar, suburban train, etc.) 10%\n64\n8%\nCar (hybrid)\n17\n2%\nOn foot, e-/bike,\ne-motorbike, etc.\n121\n15%\nCar/motorcycle (combustion engine)\n505\n61%\nNumber of employees per means of transport and the shares in % (projection from survey in November 2022 with ∅ headcount)\n41\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nEnvironment\nΩ Air travel\nTraveling by plane cannot always be avoided as we sell our systems and technologies\nworldwide. However, we are trying to limit our air travel to what is necessary.

Since 2020, in accordance with our internal guidelines, we have limited\nourselves to hybrid and electric cars when purchasing new company vehicles (with the\nexception of Korea due to a lack of availability in the selected vehicle class): Compared to\n2021, one gasoline-powered vehicle has been added.

These are\nbased on the know-how of our dedicated colleagues, who ensure the innovative strength\nof the company. Our position is strengthened by the many talented new employees that\nwe are able to recruit: Structured HR work and safe, healthy and employee-friendly\nworking conditions are essential prerequisites for this. Because only satisfied and\ncommitted employees enable long-term entrepreneurial best performance.\nΩ Occupational safety and health protection\nOur principle of occupational safety is \"zero tolerance for accidents\". We are pursuing a\npreventive approach. Our top priority is always to avoid any injuries and to minimize\npossible risks. Every accident at work is therefore examined in order to identify and\npermanently eliminate potential risks in our technical and organizational processes.\nOccupational safety and health protection are the responsibility of our managers. Our\ngoal is for every employee to understand and support our goals and measures in the area\nof occupational safety and health protection as part of their job. In 2022, this also\nincluded hygiene concepts based on the recommendations of the federal and state\ngovernments and the Robert Koch Institute for combating pandemics.\n\"Safety First!\" - that's what the Occupational Health and Safety Committee ensures\nThe members of the Occupational Health and Safety Committee (OHSC), consisting of a\nmanagement representative, two members of the works council, the company doctor,\nthe safety experts and the safety officer, meet every quarter. This group of participants\nis supplemented in the OHSC meetings by members of the severely disabled\nrepresentative, representatives of the human resources and compliance departments\nand facility management.\nIt is our aim to train our employees at least once a year in occupational health and\nsafety issues. Current aspects, e.g. B. Protective measures in times of the corona\npandemic, included in the instructions.\nTwo employees from the OHSC Group have been appointed as internal safety experts.\nTogether with the company doctor, they are responsible for advising the company\nmanagement, the executives, the works council and the employees as well as training\nthe safety officers.\nThe work of the OHSC at the German locations is currently supported by a total of 108\ncompany first aiders.\n45\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nΩ Employee Health and Safety\nThe number of days lost from work was 41 in 2022 (2021: 43). There were 5 accidents on\nbusiness trips in 2022 (2021: 1) and a total of 9 injuries with entries in the first aid manual\n(2021: 14). As in previous years, we, fortunately, had no deaths to report in 2022.\nAt AIXTRON, around 29% of our workforce works in production and around 29% in\nresearch & development. These are workplaces where the environment must meet the\nhighest safety standards and every move — even unconscious ones — must be made\nsafely and smoothly. For this reason, we attach great importance to regular training and\noptimal occupational safety equipment.\nA company integration management system after prolonged illness and reintegration\nassistance after accidents are not just legal obligation for us. They are part of our\ncorporate culture and are crucial for maintaining the ability to work and employability of\nour employees at all locations.

As preventive measures\nas part of health management, we offer our employees e.g. B. regular and ongoing\noccupational medical examinations as well as flu or corona vaccinations.\nWe are aware that good working conditions, a collegial and constructive environment,\nand a cooperative management style have an important influence on the well-being and\nhealth of our employees. For this reason, we attach great importance to a cooperative\nand constructive feedback culture.\nOur employees are encouraged by our managers to take responsibility for themselves and\ntheir colleagues. In addition, we allow our employees the greatest possible flexibility in\nwork planning to reconcile private life and work - as far as operational requirements\nallow.\n46\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nΩ Diversity and equal opportunities\nWe see diversity as a real opportunity: Because only through equal opportunities can we\ndevelop our full innovative power and strengthen our competitiveness. We value and\ntreat all of our employees equally, regardless of nationality, religion, sexual identity, age,\ngender, or social group.\nAs in the entire technology industry, AIXTRON faces the challenge of increasing the\nproportion of female employees, despite various efforts such as appropriate recruiting or\ncommunication in social media channels. The ratio is still not balanced: as of December\n31, 2022, 81% of male and 19% of female employees were employed.\nIn 2022, 940 employees (2021: 739) from around 50 (2020: 42) nations were working for\nAIXTRON worldwide.\n47\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nFlexible working day, employee recruitment & retention\nEfficient and digital processes\nIn recent years, we have digitized an increasing part of our processes.

We also offer our employees individually tailored part-time\njobs. In 2022, there were a total of 71 part-time employees (2021: 71), of whom 33 were\nwomen (2021: 38) and 38 were men (2021: 33).\nFlexible working models for the time after the pandemic\nWith a view to the time after the pandemic, a company agreement was passed in 2022\nthat generally allows employees to work mobile to an extent of up to 80% of the\nstandard working time. The respective framework depends individually on the type of\nactivity as well as the area and department. For this reason, individual maximum quotas\nwere agreed in order to take account of the respective operational needs.\nAt our global locations, we also encourage people to take advantage of the regulations\nthat apply there in the same way as they do for parental leave: In Europe, for example, a\ntotal of 25 employees took parental leave (2021: 19). In the Asia/USA regions, the offer\nwas accepted once (2021: 0). We are pleased that 19 of the 25 employees returned to\nwork after their parental leave during the reporting year (2021: 16).\nEmployees Employees returning to\nwork after parental\nleave\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nEurope 25 19 19 16\nAsia / USA 1 0 1 0\nSince 2012 we have been supporting a local daycare center (TP Hasen) to support\nAIXTRON employees and parents at the Herzogenrath site in their search for a daycare\ncenter close to the workplace.\n50\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nΩ Temporary work and fixed-term contracts\nDue to the great importance of special knowledge and expertise, AIXTRON has a strong\ninterest in retaining its employees in the company in the long term. At the same time,\nAIXTRON products are sometimes subject to strong fluctuations in demand. In order to be\nable to react flexibly to these fluctuations, we also use fixed-term contracts or work\ntogether with established engineering service providers and temporary employment\nagencies.\n2022 2021\nPermanent Temporary Permanent Temporary\nMen 475 58 372 32\nGER\nWomen 109 19 93 14\nMen 84 5 76 2\nUnited Kingdom\nWomen 14 0 12 0\nAsia/ Men 110 28 76 30\nUSA Women 38 0 29 3\nMen 669 91 524 64\nTotal\nWomen 161 19 134 17\nTotal (headcount) 940 739\nTotal (FTE) 895 718\nAt the German locations, we have concluded a works agreement for such cases.

Of the 940 employees, 830 (2021: 658) had a permanent contract.\nThe number of fixed-term contracts in the reporting year totaled 110 employees (2021:\n81), which corresponds to a share of almost 12% (2021: 11%) of the total workforce. Of\nthese, 19 were women (2021: 17) and 91 were men (2021: 64).\nInflation premium and salary level\nIn view of the inflation trend and rising energy costs, AIXTRON has decided to fully utilize\nthe legal framework of EUR 3,000 of the German government's relief package for its\nemployees. In December 2022, all employees therefore received an inflation\ncompensation bonus of EUR 1,500 — tax- and duty-free. A further payment of EUR 1,500\nwill be made at the end of 2023. This is intended to help our employees cope better with\nthe rising cost of living.\nIn 2022, the average salary level of AIXTRON employees across the Group was examined\nfor the first time in comparison with the applicable minimum wages in the individual\ncountries.

This also includes individual training\nmeasures. The core component of this is the company's own AIXTRON Academy, which\noffers general training courses on topics such as interview management, time and stress\nmanagement, as well as specialist content.\nIn addition, we promote the development of managers and employees through external,\nindividual coaching and internal coaching programs. We also increasingly support the\nexchange of ideas among employees.\nThe basis for personnel development and career planning is the annual employee\nappraisal that has taken place since 2013, in which the qualification requirements for\ncurrent and future tasks are determined. The personal interests and wishes of the\nemployees are also recorded. Based on a company-wide standard, managers, and\nemployees can give each other feedback and discuss measures to improve cooperation\nwhere necessary and promote the employee's strengths. Another component of the\nemployee appraisal is the agreement on development goals.\nIn 2022, AIXTRON invested an average of over EUR 568 (2021: EUR 472) per employee in\npersonnel development and training. On average, each employee received over 32.8\nhours of training per year in 2022 (2021: 13.3).\nSecuring our young talent with training\nWe see it not only as our social obligation but also as the basis for the continued success\nof our company to train young people in technical and commercial professions as well as\nin dual study programs. In this way, we give young people the chance to prove\nthemselves, develop their strengths with us, and make a contribution.

It is important\nto us to offer young people prospects after they have completed their training.\nFor this reason, all trainees and dual students who wished to remain with the company\nwere taken on in recent years. To this end, a corresponding agreement was reached with\nthe works council at the Herzogenrath site.\n56\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nCompany suggestion scheme\nNew ideas and wishes often arise in the thoroughly structured and planned everyday\nprocesses, some of which are not implemented or shared throughout the company.\nHowever, as we want to make these usable and valuable for everyone, we established a\nglobally standardized company suggestion scheme as part of the innovation management\nprocess in 2015.\n89\n2020\n28\n77\n2021\n32\n134\n2022\n21\nThe submitted and accepted suggestions for improvement of the AIXTRON Group\nImprovement proposal submitted Improvement proposal accepted\nWe encourage our employees to submit their ideas for process improvements, cost\nsavings, product enhancements, or the like.

For this reason, we have been sponsoring social projects for many years\nand supporting the voluntary work of our employees at the annual company run. In\naddition, we give schoolchildren and students the opportunity to gain professional\norientation by gaining an insight into our company.\nPromotion of science, education and professional development\nSupporting young people in science, education and career development is important to\nus. Since 2017, we have therefore maintained long-term school cooperation with\nAachen's Einhard Gymnasium. We also offer schoolchildren and students the opportunity\nto gain insight into the various professional fields of our technology company through\nlectures, company tours, or internships. As a sponsoring member of the Industry and\nEconomy Working Group of the German Physical Society, we have thus been offering the\n\"Day on Site\" for many years, for example.\nCooperation with the Aachen Einhard High School\nSince 2017, AIXTRON and Einhard-Gymnasium in Aachen have been involved in a\nlearning partnership as part of the KURS initiative (Cooperation Network for Companies\nin the Region and Schools). As part of this \"learning partnership\", schools have the\nopportunity to give their students a tangible demonstration of business using the\nconcrete example of a partner company. At the same time, companies have the\nopportunity to present themselves as employers and \"good neighbors\".\nFor example, as part of \"career exploration days\" and \"Girls' and Boys' Day\", the\nstudents were given the opportunity to have a personal exchange with our trainees\nduring a company visit. Reports on their experiences with career guidance were\nexchanged and the topic of training and related career opportunities at AIXTRON were\ndiscussed. In addition, dual training and study programs were presented as an\nalternative to university studies, and a selection process was simulated as part of an\nassessment center. At the regular \"Berufsstraße\" event, we also explain in detail the\nvarious apprenticeships at AIXTRON to school students and are available to answer their\nindividual questions.\n58\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nThird „AIXTRON Global Virtual Run“\nSince 2011, we have participated in the annual “Aachen Company Run” and have taken\npart in the \"Chariots of Fire\" relay race in Cambridge for the second time. We support the\nmotivation of employees to do something for their health and pay the entry fees, which\nare then donated to charitable organizations in the region.\nIn the past reporting year 2022, our “AIXTRON Global Virtual Run” (AGVR) took place for\nthe third time — with growing success: While a total of 177 colleagues worldwide took\npart in 2021, we already had 262 registrations in the current reporting year — 51% more\nthan in the previous year. In 2022, AIXTRON employees covered more than 1,500\nkilometers walking and running and 2,190 kilometers on bicycles as a team. This time,\nAIXTRON teams from Germany, the UK, the USA, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and\nChina took part.\nThe annual \"Global Virtual Run\" was first launched in 2020 - partly in response to the\nCorona pandemic. This was because it allowed employees to do something sporty\ntogether. This was regardless of where they happened to be in the world, without having\nto come together in one place. The focus of the \"Virtual Run\" is on the \"we feeling\": A\nkind of competition does develop. But it's less about which individuals achieve the best\ntimes, and more about how much the AIXTRON team can achieve together.\nAIXTRON supports\nIn total, the participants ran more than 3,700 kilometers, which resulted in a donation of\nEUR 7,500 due to our offer to donate about EUR 2 per kilometer run. The amount was\ndonated to \"Wings for Life\" at the beginning of 2023. This is a non-profit, state-recognized\nfoundation for spinal cord research, whose goal is to find a cure for paraplegia.\n59\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nSocial\nAt the beginning of 2022, the images and news about the war in Ukraine shook us for the\nfirst time. Since the issue has moved us greatly ever since we have been looking for a way\nto help the victims and fulfill our responsibility in terms of humanitarian solidarity: During\nthe reporting year 2022, a total of EUR 50,000 was donated to support war refugees in\nour region. The German Red Cross, the joint aid campaign of RWTH Aachen University\nand the University Hospital as well as the Ukraine emergency aid of \"Aktion Deutschland\nhilft\" were considered.\nAt the end of the year, we again made a conscious decision to forego printed Christmas\ncards and to provide our employees with digital company Christmas cards for their\nbusiness contacts. Since this also saved printing and material costs, we donated an\namount of EUR 5,000 at the beginning of 2023 to the charitable project Brückenschlag —\nan association of many Aachen-based service providers, institutions, and individuals to\nsupport families with a family member or parent suffering from cancer.\n60\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\n61\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nCorporate Governance\nAIXTRON is committed to the principles of transparent, responsible corporate governance\nfocused on sustainable value creation. By managing and monitoring the Company\naccordingly, we — the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board — aim to live up to the\ntrust placed in us by our shareholders, the financial markets, our customers, business\npartners, employees, and the general public. We are convinced that this type of\nsustainable corporate governance, as well as the responsible actions of our employees,\nform an essential basis for the success of our company.\nThe corporate governance declaration pursuant to sections 289f, 315d of the German\nCommercial Code (HGB) and the current declaration of conformity pursuant to\nsection 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which was adopted by the\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board in February 2023, are permanently available on\nour website under Investoren/Corporate Governance.\nΩ Legal conformity, compliance and information security\nThe Executive Board is committed to conducting all business in an ethical and legally\nsound manner. In addition to compliance with legal requirements, our internal guidelines\nand the interests of key stakeholders are taken into account.\nAIXTRON does not tolerate any corrupt or criminal behavior and expressly distances itself\nfrom human rights violations. In addition to the legal framework, our internal company\ncodes, guidelines, and management systems provide the framework for action.\nSince 2006, the AIXTRON Code of Ethics has applied to the Finance department, and in\nparticular to members of the Executive Board and senior finance executives and persons\nin key positions. This is intended to ensure that honest and ethical behavior is practiced.\nFinance executives and persons in key functions confirm annually for their area of\nresponsibility that the Code of Ethics issued by the Executive Board is known and\ncomplied with.\nIn addition, the Executive Board, Supervisory Board, senior management team, and our\nemployees throughout the company are bound by a Compliance Code of Conduct which\nobliges them to act responsibly and in compliance with the law. This is underpinned by\nthe regularly updated Compliance Manual and additional compliance policies with\nspecific guidelines for action and is taught in training courses. Adherence to our\ncompliance requirements is confirmed in writing on a quarterly basis by the senior\nmanagement team and key employees. Participation in compliance training is mandatory\nfor all new employees of the company. Compliance training is conducted on a regular\nbasis using a risk-based approach. This process is managed and monitored by our\nCompliance department.\n62\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nReports of possible violations of international and national laws as well as compliance\nrequirements and rules of conduct of the AIXTRON Group can be made directly to\nAIXTRON's Compliance Department as well as through AIXTRON's Whistleblowing System.\nOur company-wide Anti-Corruption Policy defines formal and concrete rules and\nprinciples of conduct to combat corruption and bribery and is binding for our employees.\nAn elementary component of our company-wide compliance training program is to\nsensitize our employees to identify potential corruption and bribery risks in their daily\nactivities at an early stage. This also includes preventive anti-corruption measures.\nIn the reporting year 2022, as in the previous year, no events relating to bribery and\ncorruption were reported to us throughout the AIXTRON Group.\nΩ Supplier Manual\nAIXTRON places the same expectations and conditions on its suppliers as it does on itself.\nThese are defined in a mandatory supplier manual.\nThis defines the ethical and legal framework for social and ecological standards, e.g. with\nregard to human rights, corruption, or conflict minerals such as raw materials and mineral\nresources that are mined or extracted in conflict areas.\nIn addition to the price and quality of the purchased goods, compliance with these\nstandards is a fundamental prerequisite for long-term cooperation (see chapter\n“Konfliktmineralien”).\n63\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nΩ Conflict Minerals\nCompetition for natural resources such as minerals, oil, and charcoal, promotes the\nsystematic violation of human rights and environmental pollution worldwide. Proceeds\nfrom the extraction of raw materials help fuel armed conflicts and finance civil wars.\nProduction or mining of these materials often takes place illegally and outside state\ncontrol, controlled by groups of rebels or militias, and at the expense of the miners.\nAIXTRON is committed to conducting its business fairly and with decency and respect in\nall countries where the company is present. Therefore, AIXTRON supports the objectives\nof both the US Dodd-Frank Act and the EU Conflict Minerals Regulations to disclose the\norigin of risky minerals used in our products. As part of its due diligence, the AIXTRON\nGroup has implemented a management system for this purpose, based on the OECD\nGuidelines for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk\nregions.\nAll direct suppliers who may be supplying materials with potential conflict minerals are\ncontacted and asked to identify the countries of origin of the minerals and report them to\nAIXTRON. Should this reveal the use of a raw material supplier that is linked to human\nrights violations and environmental pollution, we react consistently and work to ensure\nthat this supplier critically examines the raw material supplier in question and removes it\nfrom the joint supply chain. In order to enable internal and external persons and\nstakeholders to raise indications, concerns, and complaints in connection with conflict\nminerals - anonymously if desired - AIXTRON has established a complaints mechanism,\nwhich can be viewed on the AIXTRON website, among others.\n64\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAIXTRON's ability to work towards completely conflict-free smelters worldwide as part of\nits supply chain is limited. In order to maximize the influence and impact of conflict-free\nsourcing, we decided to join the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) many years ago.\nWe actively participate in the organization, including assisting smelters to sustainably\nmeet the demonstration of conflict-free mineral sourcing and as part of the RMI\ncertification process.\nΩ Privacy compliance\nHandling the personal data of our customers, partners, and employees in a legally\ncompliant and trustworthy manner is our top priority. For many years, data protection\nhas been anchored in our company through corresponding guidelines, standards, and\nprocesses. In order to meet the requirements of the European Union's General Data\nProtection Regulation (EU GDPR), which has been in force in all member states since May\n2018, we have further developed our processes - where necessary.\nIn implementing the legal requirements, we are supported and advised by an external,\nindependent data protection officer. We did not report any incidents to our data\nprotection officer or the relevant authorities for the reporting year 2022.\nΩ Information Security\nAs a technologically forward-looking company,\nthe focus is on protecting our IT infrastructure to\nprotect us from the loss of valuable and important\ndata as well as sensitive failures in our operating\nbusiness. We take these threats very seriously.\nDr. Christian Danninger · Executive Board (CFO)\nThe protection of our business and trade secrets as well as the protection of sensitive\ndata is of very high importance to us as a global technology company with high innovative\nstrength. In times of advancing digitization and networking in our society, the threat of\ncyber espionage and sabotage is also growing. Information security has played an\nessential role for years and enjoys a very high priority because attacks on the IT\ninfrastructure can lead to the loss or violation of the integrity of this sensitive and\nconfidential data. Our \"Information Security\" department is part of the independent\ncorporate governance organization and is tasked with continuously identifying, analyzing,\nand evaluating potential vulnerabilities together with our IT department and other\nspecialist departments. Based on these results, suitable protection mechanisms are\nintegrated into our existing information security environment and their effectiveness is\nmonitored.\n65\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nIn addition to technical and organizational measures, our employees and their awareness\nin dealing with sensitive and confidential data play a very important role. Our Group-wide\ntraining program and the mandatory participation of all employees in regular security\ntraining sessions are key components in promoting awareness. Our existing information\nsecurity environment is subject to continuous further development in order to protect\nour business and trade secrets as well as sensitive data in the best possible way. In fiscal\nyear 2022, we were not aware of any incidents relating to breaches of our information\nsecurity.\n66\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nQuality management and product safety\nThe best product safety and reliability of our\nequipment are the result of our high quality\nstandards and an important basis for our lasting\nbusiness success.\nDr. Jochen Linck · Executive Board (COO)\nWe enjoy a leading position in the market, resulting from a great deal of trust placed in us\nby our customers. For us, it is both an obligation and an incentive to ensure our technical\nexcellence, first-class service and high-quality standards at all times.\nWe consistently pursue a zero-defect strategy in our promise of quality and the safety of\nour equipment. This is the claim we make on ourselves, as well as on our suppliers. It is\nnot only our self-image to comply with all legal product requirements, standards and\nnorms as well as safety aspects and proper labelling.\nIt is also part of our self-image to implement all local requirements in our customer\nmarkets. For this reason, product safety begins with our product development and\naccompanies the entire procurement and production process.\nFormal, overarching responsibility for product safety and quality lies with the Executive\nBoard, which has assigned the goals and tasks to the Head of Quality Management. Our\nQuality Department is responsible for the further development of our quality\nmanagement system, issues company-wide regulations and regularly checks compliance\nwith them. The quality manual and the quality policy describe the core of our actions and\nare publicly available.\nGuidelines and processes ensure both our product safety and product development and\nregulate the handling of possible defects at appropriate escalation levels. Our Head of\nQuality Management regularly informs the Executive Board about significant\ndevelopments and possible quality incidents that could be classified as critical.\nIn fiscal 2022, no significant quality defects were identified that had a material impact on\nthe health and safety of our customers.\nΩ Key figures of supplier relations\nDue to the high value added contribution in the supply chain, the procurement process is\nof high importance for AIXTRON's long-term success. We do not manufacture mechanical\nand electrical systems and components ourselves, but focus on development,\nconfiguration and final assembly.\n67\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nWe place a high value on working in partnership with our suppliers. This is expressed, for\nexample, through development partnerships in which we jointly develop components and\nassemblies with suppliers. Decisive factors for the selection of suppliers are primarily\nquality, manufacturing competence, delivery reliability, and price.\nFurthermore, we require compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the provisions\nof our supplier manual. In addition, we demand that international minimum standards in\nthe area of sustainability, such as the core labor standards of the International Labor\nOrganization (ILO), are met. We do not tolerate the use of conflict minerals within the\nsupply chain.\nWe currently work with 1,202 suppliers from 28 countries (2021: 1,126 suppliers from 29\ncountries). We use a risk-oriented approach to monitor that all material sustainability\naspects are taken into account. In the first step, compliance with the environmental and\nsocial standards of all suppliers is checked by means of self-disclosure in the form of a\nquestionnaire. In the questionnaire, suppliers must explain the processes established in\ntheir company to ensure compliance with the standards. All relevant documents are\nmade available to existing and potential suppliers via our corporate website.\nAs part of the expansion of our quality department, the frequency and scope of our audits\nwere successively increased: While there were 13 audits in 2020, we already had 19 in\n2021 and 32 in the current reporting year 2022.\nWe encourage our suppliers to establish management systems in the areas of\noccupational safety, health, and environmental protection that comply with DIN EN ISO\n9001, ISO 14001, or BS OHSAS 18001, or similar standards.\nThe cooperation extends to suppliers, e.g. from the mechanical and plant engineering\nsector, and the electrical engineering sector, but also engineering service providers as\nwell as suppliers of technical gases or even energy suppliers. AIXTRON is an international\ncompany but still has local roots.\nKey data supplier 2022 2021 Δ\nOrder-Volume in EUR Mio. 313 266 47\nNumber of Supplier 1,202 1,126 76\nNumber of Countries 28 29 -1\nNumber of Supplier Audits 32 19 13\nPrior-year figures adjusted\n68\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\n2022 - Distribution of purchasing volume per region\nEurope 82.6%\nAsia 1.7%\nNorth-/South America 15.7%\nEurope Asia North-/South America\nDespite global purchasing, local value creation plays a very important role for us. The\nreason for this is, among other things, the high technical demands on our suppliers and\nthe short communication channels. In Germany, for example, 58.7% (2021: 57.1%) of the\npurchasing volume is procured. The decisive factor for the selection is always that the\nsupplier meets our high-quality requirements, has the necessary manufacturing expertise,\nand offers competitive prices.\n69\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAssociations and initiatives\nWe are involved in a variety of organizations and associations to further promote\necologically sustainable development and resource efficiency in photonics and\nsemiconductor technology. We are a founding member of Photonics21, now a Private\nPublic Partnership (PPP) with the European Commission, and the International Solid State\nLighting Alliance (ISA) in China, and actively promote their further development.\nCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) / MSCI\nSince 2010, as part of our participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), we have\nreported once a year on the environmental impact of our business activities and our\ncorporate strategy to reduce CO emissions. In this way, AIXTRON promotes\n2\ntransparency for investors, companies, political decision-makers, and the media.\nAIXTRON achieved a B rating in the current reporting year 2022. In the MSCI rating, we\nwere able to improve - from A to now AA.\nPart of the national initiative „Energy-Efficiency-Network“\nSince 2016, we have been involved in the \"Energy Efficiency Network\" as a founding\nmember together with six other companies in the Aachen region. The aim of the\nnetwork is to identify and realize economic energy-saving potential in companies. In\nrecent years, more than 60,000 megawatt hours of energy have already been saved,\navoiding more than 18,000 tons of CO emissions. AIXTRON has also been able to\n2\nleverage the benefits of the network, with its quarterly meetings, for its energy and\nclimate footprint. In 2020, we renewed our membership in the Energy Efficiency\nNetwork and plan to continue our participation in the coming years. The network is part\nof the nationwide \"Energy Efficiency Networks\" initiative launched by the German\ngovernment and leading German industry associations and organizations. The goal of\nthe initiative was to save up to 75 PJ of primary energy or 5 million tons of GHG\nemissions by 2020 through the initiation and implementation of around 500 new energy\nefficiency company networks. In September 2020, the German Federal Ministry for\nEconomic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) commissioned the continuation of the project until\n2025, now under the title \"Initiative Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Networks\".\nBy the end of 2025, the initiative aims to establish 350 new networks, saving nine to\neleven terawatt hours of final energy and five to six million tons of GHG emissions.\n70\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nCorporate Governance\nMemberships in organizations and associations\nHeadquarters of\norganization/\nOrganizations/associations Function/committee Thematic focus association\nISA, International Solid State Founding member Promoting sustainable development and application of LED solid state Shanghai, China\nLighting Alliance lighting.\nResponsible Minerals Initiative Active member of the Identification of all worldwide melts aimed at ensuring responsible mineral Alexandria, USA\n“Smelter Engagement procurement by the companies.\nTeam” for Europe\nand Africa\nDGKK, Deutsche Gesellschaft Member Promoting research, teaching and technology in crystal growth, crystal Erlangen, Germany\nfür Kristallwachstum und breeding, and epitaxy.\nKristallzüchtung e.V.\nDPG, Deutsche Physikalische Supporting member Promoting contacts and dialog in physics and industry with a focus on Bad Honnef, Germany\nGesellschaft in Industry and training physicists during their studies.

The\nseparate consolidated non-financial report consists of the reporting sections of the\nsustainability report marked with an omega sign (\"Ω\") - with the exception of individual\ndisclosures marked as unaudited.\nManagement Responsibilities\nThe legal representatives of AIXTRON are responsible for the preparation of the separate\nconsolidated non-financial report for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31,\n2022 in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of\nREGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of\nJune 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment,\nand amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and\nthe supplementing Delegated Acts as well as the interpretation of the wordings and terms\ncontained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nThis responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of\nappropriate methods to prepare the separate consolidated non-financial report and the\nuse of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under\nthe given circumstances. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the\ninternal controls they deem necessary for the preparation of the separate consolidated\nnon-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud\n(manipulation of the separate consolidated non-financial report) or error.\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Delegated Acts contain wordings\nand terms that are still subject to substantial uncertainties regarding their interpretation\nand for which not all clarifications have been published yet. Therefore, the legal\nrepresentatives have included a description of their interpretation in Chapter „EU-\nTaxonomy“ of the separated consolidated non-financial report. They are responsible for\nthe validity of this interpretation. Due to the innate risk of diverging interpretations of\nvague legal concepts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to\nuncertainty.\n1\nOur engagement applied to the German version of the separate consolidated non-financial report. This text\nis a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German, whereas the German text is\nauthoritative.\n83\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nIndependent Auditor's Report\nIndependence and Quality Assurance on the Part of the Auditing Firm\nIn performing this engagement, we applied the legal provisions and professional\npronouncements regarding independence and quality assurance, in particular the\nProfessional Code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany)\nand the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der\nWirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW\nQS 1).\nPractitioner Responsibilities\nIt is our responsibility to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the separate\nconsolidated non-financial report based on the audit we have performed.\nWe conducted our work in the form of a limited assurance engagement in accordance\nwith the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised):\n“Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial\nInformation”, published by IAASB. Accordingly, we have to plan and perform the\nassurance engagement in such a way that we obtain limited assurance as to whether any\nmatters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the company’s Chapters\nand Sections marked “Ω“ (except for the disclosures marked as non-audited) in the\nsustainability report of AIXTRON for the reporting period from January 1, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2022, have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with\nthe §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and\nthe delegated acts issued for this purpose as well as the interpretation presented in the\n“EU Taxonomy” chapter of the separate consolidated non-financial report by the legal\nrepresentatives.\nAs the assurance procedures performed during a limited assurance engagement are less\ncomprehensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, the level of assurance\nobtained is substantially lower. The determination of assurance procedures is subject to\nthe auditor’s own judgement.\nWithin the scope of our engagement, we performed, among others, the following\nassurance procedures:\n• Creation of an understanding of the interdisciplinary structures for the management of\nsustainability aspects of the group and the involvement of stakeholders\n• Inquiries of the legal representatives and relevant personnel who were involved in the\npreparation of the separate consolidated non-financial report about the preparation\nprocess, the internal control system related to this process and information in the\nseparate consolidated non-financial report\n• Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the separate consolidated\nnonfinancial report\n• Analytical assessment of selected information from the separate consolidated non-\nfinancial report\n• Comparison of selected information with the corresponding data in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and group management report\n84\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n• Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for the materiality analysis in\norder to understand the processes for determining material topics and respective\nreporting boundaries for AIXTRON\n• A risk analysis, including media research, to identify relevant information on AIXTRON’s\nsustainability performance within the reporting period\n• Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the\ncollection, processing and monitoring of disclosures, including data consolidation, on\nenvironmental, employee and social matters, respect for human rights, and combating\ncorruption and bribery\n• Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for determining disclosures on\nconcepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control\nfunctions and consolidating disclosures\n• Inspection of selected internal and external documents\n• Analytical procedures for the evaluation of data and of the trends in quantitative\ndisclosures as reported at group level by all sites\n• Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the\nreliability of reported data based on a sample basis\n• Group-level interviews with responsible employees to gain an understanding of how to\nidentify relevant economic activities according to the EU taxonomy\n• Evaluation of the process for the identification of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-\naligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the report\n• Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures\nThe legal representatives must interpret vague legal concepts in order to be able to\ncompile the relevant disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation. Due to the innate risk of diverging interpretations of vague legal concepts, the\nlegal conformity of these interpretations and, correspondingly, our assurance thereof are\nsubject to uncertainty.\nConclusion\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our\nattention that causes us to believe that the separate consolidated non-financial report of\nAIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath, for the period January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, in the\nform of the sections of the sustainability report marked with an \"Ω\", with the exception\nof individual information marked as unaudited, have not been prepared, in all material\nrespects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU\nTaxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts issued for this purpose as well as the\nchapter \"EU Taxonomy\" of the separate consolidated non-financial report has been\nprepared by the legal representatives.\n85\nAIXTRON | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nIndependent Auditor's Report\nRestriction of Use/General Engagement Terms\nThis assurance report is issued for purposes of the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE,\nHerzogenrath, only. We assume no responsibility with regard to any third parties.\nOur assignment for the Executive Board of AIXTRON SE, Herzogenrath, and professional\nliability as described above were governed by the General Engagement Terms for\nWirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften (Allgemeine\nAuftragsbedingungen für Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften) in the\nversion dated January 1, 2017 (https://www.kpmg.de/bescheinigungen/lib/\naab_english.pdf).

The three most important projects implemented in the past year are provided as examples below.\nOptimization of control technology at the energy management\ncenter at the Dornkaulstrasse site*\nIn cooperation with a nationwide company, we introduced monitoring in\nour energy management center in 2017 and began continually adjusting\nand optimizing our measurement and control technology. This project,\nwhich ran to the end of 2021, generated savings totaling around 42,000\nkWh in its final year.\nOptimization of control technology at the energy management\ncenter at the Kaiserstrasse site*\nHere too, we cooperated with a nationwide company to continually\nadjust and optimize our measurement and control technology by working\nwith permanent monitoring. The project generated savings of around\n54,000 kWh in total last year.\nExchange of filters for our ventilation systems\nat the Dornkaulstrasse site\nIn the past year under report we replaced the filters in our ventilation\nsystems with more efficient versions and thus saved 60,000 kWh in total\n(calculated over one year).\n* In calculating our energy and CO savings, we were assisted by external companies who provided us with technical advice based on their engineering skills and specialist expertise.

It goes without saying that this is also an economic factor for us,\nas lower consumption also reduces our costs.\nWe are continually developing our energy efficiency enhancement measures\nfurther. Our targets refer above all to our R&D and production sites in Germany\nand the UK.\nDespite the significant growth in business volumes, our electricity needs of\n10,883,534 kWh in 2021 were significantly lower than in 2020 (11,672,526 kWh).\nThe energy saving projects already referred to were the main driver of this\npositive development.\nAt 3,452,892 kWh in total, our consumption of natural gas and district heating\nrose significantly compared with 2020 (2,258,854 kWh). The main reason for this\nincrease was that, due to coronavirus protection measures, the fresh-air share\nof overall ventilation systems had to be raised from 10 % to 50 %.

Here, the young people share their experiences of careers choices and find out more about vocational training and the\nresultant c areer opportunities at AIXTRON. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of dual training and study programs as an alternative to college study\nare presented and a selection process is simulated in an assessment center.

In 1951, the Russian physicist Oleg Vladimirovich Losev found that inorganic materials\nGRI Content Index\ncan emit light when a suitable circuit is installed. The first commercial diode emitting light, in this case red, to come to market, was developed by Nick Holonyak\nin 1962. This laid the foundation for the industrial production of modern LEDs.\nIndependent\nAuditor’s Report\nAt the end of 1997, the first commercially successful white LED based on this technology was launched onto the market. To date, this\ntechnology is still standard in the industry. At the beginning of the new millennium, the first LEDs reached a light yield of 50 lumens\nper watt. By 2009/2011, the yield was already 6 times higher (300 lumens per watt).
