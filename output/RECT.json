In Singapore Dollars, net income was S$3.36 million, or S$0.27 per diluted share, for the fiscal ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of S$3.93 million, or S$0.31 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, was $4.73 million. In Singapore Dollars, Adjusted EBITDA increased to S$6.37, from S$6.15 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n“We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown from all of our employees that resulted in a year of solid performance and growth, culminating in our successful IPO and listing on Nasdaq,” said Mr. Jian Zhang, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Director at Rectitude. “The capital we raised through this process will be invested back into the Company to cultivate and foster long-term sustainable growth, enhanced operational efficiencies and continued exemplary service to our customers. We have already demonstrated this through our new branch opened earlier this calendar year, designed to increase our strategic presence across Singapore. We will continue to evaluate new opportunities as they present themselves to continue our growth and deliver enhanced shareholder value.”\n\n**Revenues**\n\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, total revenues were $30.69 million. In Singapore Dollars, revenues were S$41.35 million and S$37.64 for the respective fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase was primarily driven by stronger customer demand for safety equipment given the increased construction activity within the Company’s markets.\n\n**Cost of Revenues**\n\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, cost of revenues was $19.77 million. In Singapore Dollars, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues were S$26.65 million and S$25.50 million, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue was consistent with the increase of revenue during the year, offset due to better procurement costs secured from larger volumes of orders and more favorable product mix, as our safety equipment mainly consist of our own branded products that typically have higher margins.\n\n**Gross profit**\n\nGross profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was $10.92 million, representing 35.57% of operating revenues. In Singapore Dollars, gross profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was S$14.71 million and $12.14 million, representing 35.57% and 32.25% of operating revenues, respectively. The increase in gross profit was mainly due to increased sales volume of safety equipment and related operating leverage, favorable product mix, as well as improved efficiencies.\n\n**Selling and marketing expenses**\n\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily included expenses related to advertising and marketing activities and associated costs of our retail branches, which included labor costs, sales commissions and operating lease expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, selling and marketing expenses were $2.54 million. In Singapore Dollars, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, selling and marketing expenses were S$3.42 million and S$2.10 million respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the allocation of resources to running and expanding retail branches along with an increase in the number of branch employees from 30 to 36, which is expected to continue in the next year. \n\n**Research and development expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses primarily consisted of compensation cost to engineering, design and product development employees and software expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, research and development expenses were $0.05 million. In Singapore Dollars, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were S$0.07 million and S$0.08 million respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in software expenses.\n\n**General and administrative expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consisted primarily of motor vehicle running expenses, transportation, property maintenance and property tax, allowance for expected credit losses and general administrative expenses such as staff costs, depreciation, legal and professional fees and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $5.23 million. In Singapore Dollars, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were S$7.04 million and S$5.17 million respectively. The increase was mainly due to an increase in staff expenses resulting from increased number of employees from 68 to 71, annual salary increment adjustments, an increase in professional fees related to the IPO as well as expenses to support business growth.\n\n**Net Income**\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $2.49 million. In Singapore Dollars, net income for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 was approximately S$3.36 million, compared to net income of S$3.93 million, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Earnings per Share – Basic and Diluted**\n\nEarnings per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was $0.20. In Singapore Dollars, earnings per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was S$0.27, compared to S$0.31 for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nThe Company also views earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to specific adjustments (Adjusted EBITDA) as an important measure of the results of operations. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was $4.73 million. In Singapore dollars, Adjusted EBITDA increased to S$6.37 million, from S$6.15 million during the same period. The increase was primarily due to exclusion of certain non-recurring items, such as professional fees incurred in relation to the IPO (referred to as “non-GAAP adjustments”), from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. GAAP figures. \n\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP adjustments provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its business by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating result.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nContemplating the Company’s Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025, Mr. Zhang commented, “We look forward to another auspicious year of growth and strong operating performance for Rectitude. Upon completing our IPO, we have raised sufficient capital to fund our growth and begin executing our long-term strategic plan. We will continue to invest in expanding our branches and developing new product offerings to meet the enhanced demand for worker safety within the Southeast Asian markets we serve. We maintain our focus on the core principles that have guided our Company for more than 25 years as we drive our performance to new heights.”\n\n**About Rectitude Holdings Ltd**\n\nFounded in 1997 in Singapore, Rectitude is principally involved in the provision of safety equipment, encompassing essential items such as personal protective clothing, gloves, safety footwear, personal fall arrest systems, portable fire extinguishers and traffic products.
