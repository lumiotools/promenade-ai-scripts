Wainwright Conference | September 9-11, 2024 | www.rcihospitality.com | @RCIHHinc\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-\nlooking statements generally can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely\nresult,” and similar expressions.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from\nthose reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this presentation and those\ndiscussed in other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThis presentation may contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated\nin this presentation, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties associated with (i) operating and managing an adult entertainment or restaurant business, (ii) the business climates in\ncities where we operate, (iii) the success or lack thereof in launching and building our businesses, (iv) cyber security, (v) conditions relevant to real estate transactions, (vi) the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and (vii) numerous other factors such as laws governing the operation of adult entertainment or restaurant businesses, competition and dependence on key personnel.\nFor more detailed discussion of such factors and certain risks and uncertainties, see RCI’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, as well as its other filings with\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition, and\nresults of operations for an extended period of time.\nAs used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (RCIHH) and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nTrademarks\nExcept as otherwise indicated, all trademarks, service marks, logos, and trade names in this presentation are property of RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries or affiliates.\n2\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and\nenhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial\nposition or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We\nmonitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding\n(or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows:\n• Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income\nfrom operations and operating margin: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets, (c) settlement of lawsuits, (d) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (e) gains or\nlosses on insurance, and (f) stock-based compensation. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and\noperating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations.\n• Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share. We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items\nto net income or loss attributable to RCIHH common stockholders and diluted earnings per share. Adjustment items are: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets, (c) settlement\nof lawsuits, (d) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (e) gains or losses on insurance, (f) stock-based compensation, and (g) the income tax effect of the above-described\nadjustments. Included in the income tax effect of the above adjustments is the net effect of the non-GAAP provision for income taxes, calculated at 11.7% and 21.6% effective tax rate of the\npre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the GAAP income tax expense (benefit). We believe that excluding and including\nsuch items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.\n• Adjusted EBITDA. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income or loss attributable to RCIHH common stockholders: (a) depreciation and amortization, (b)\nimpairment of assets, (c) income tax expense (benefit), (d) net interest expense, (e) settlement of lawsuits, (f) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (g) gains or losses on\ninsurance, and (h) stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides\na core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic\njurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance\nreturn on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also the target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs.\n• We also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow.
