We are also beginning to drive momentum with the expansion of our franchise network across eight strategic markets in the U.S., starting with a new store opening in Edmond, Oklahoma next month. We are finalizing new franchise agreements for three additional store locations, which we expect to announce in the coming weeks. At the same time, our rebranding initiative is nearly complete, and we anticipate unveiling the new store design by year-end, which will enhance the RMCF experience for both franchisees and consumers.”\n\nGeygan continued, “Subsequent to quarter end, we took an important step to improve our financial position with a new $6 million credit facility, which allowed us to retire our previous $4 million credit facility and raise additional capital for ongoing investments. With a strengthened balance sheet, improved liquidity and a committed franchise network, we believe we are well-positioned to execute our three-year strategic plan and drive RMCF toward sustainable growth and profitability.”\n\n**Fiscal Q2 2025 Financial Results vs. Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $6.4 million compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter.\n  * Total product and retail gross profit was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million. Gross margin improved to 11.5% compared to 7.7%.

(Nasdaq: RMCF) (the “Company”, “we”, or “RMCF”), an international franchisor and producer of premium chocolates and other confectionery products including gourmet caramel apples, is reporting financial and operating results for its fiscal second quarter ended August 31, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased with our progress this quarter as we begin executing our multi-year strategic plan,” said Jeff Geygan, Interim CEO of RMCF. “We have been focused on several critical areas of the business: strengthening the company’s liquidity, rebuilding a strong executive team, expanding our franchise network, and laying a solid foundation for sustainable growth and profitability.\n\n“In recent months, we welcomed several key team members, including a new CFO to lead our finance organization. We are also beginning to drive momentum with the expansion of our franchise network across eight strategic markets in the U.S., starting with a new store opening in Edmond, Oklahoma next month. We are finalizing new franchise agreements for three additional store locations, which we expect to announce in the coming weeks. At the same time, our rebranding initiative is nearly complete, and we anticipate unveiling the new store design by year-end, which will enhance the RMCF experience for both franchisees and consumers.”\n\nGeygan continued, “Subsequent to quarter end, we took an important step to improve our financial position with a new $6 million credit facility, which allowed us to retire our previous $4 million credit facility and raise additional capital for ongoing investments. With a strengthened balance sheet, improved liquidity and a committed franchise network, we believe we are well-positioned to execute our three-year strategic plan and drive RMCF toward sustainable growth and profitability.”\n\n**Fiscal Q2 2025 Financial Results vs. Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $6.4 million compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter.\n  * Total product and retail gross profit was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million. Gross margin improved to 11.5% compared to 7.7%. The increase was primarily attributable to increased pricing and improved operating efficiencies.\n  * Total Costs and Expenses were reduced to $7.3 million compared to $7.6 million in the year-ago period.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was $0.7 million or ($0.11) per share, compared to net loss of $1.0 million or ($0.16) per share in fiscal Q2 2024.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its financial results.

(Nasdaq: RMCF) (the “Company”, “we”, or “RMCF”), an international franchisor\nand producer of premium chocolates and other confectionery products including gourmet\ncaramel apples, is reporting financial and operating results for its fiscal second quarter\nended August 31, 2024.\n“We are pleased with our progress this quarter as we begin executing our multi-year\nstrategic plan,” said Jeff Geygan, Interim CEO of RMCF. “We have been focused on several\ncritical areas of the business: strengthening the company’s liquidity, rebuilding a strong\nexecutive team, expanding our franchise network, and laying a solid foundation for\nsustainable growth and profitability.\n“In recent months, we welcomed several key team members, including a new CFO to lead\nour finance organization. We are also beginning to drive momentum with the expansion of\nour franchise network across eight strategic markets in the U.S., starting with a new store\nopening in Edmond, Oklahoma next month. We are finalizing new franchise agreements for\nthree additional store locations, which we expect to announce in the coming weeks. At the\nsame time, our rebranding initiative is nearly complete, and we anticipate unveiling the new\nstore design by year-end, which will enhance the RMCF experience for both franchisees and\nconsumers.”\nGeygan continued, “Subsequent to quarter end, we took an important step to improve our\nfinancial position with a new $6 million credit facility, which allowed us to retire our previous\n$4 million credit facility and raise additional capital for ongoing investments. With a\nstrengthened balance sheet, improved liquidity and a committed franchise network, we\nbelieve we are well-positioned to execute our three-year strategic plan and drive RMCF\ntoward sustainable growth and profitability.”\nFiscal Q2 2025 Financial Results vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $6.4 million compared to $6.6 million\nin the year-ago quarter.\nTotal product and retail gross profit was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million. Gross\nmargin improved to 11.5% compared to 7.7%.

BUSINESS\nOur Company\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “Rocky Mountain,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including its\noperating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“RMCF”), is an international franchisor, confectionery producer\nand retail operator. Founded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado and produce an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products\n(“Durango Products”). Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/licensed system of retail stores that feature chocolate and other confectionary\nproducts. We also sell our candy in select locations outside of our system of retail stores. As of February 29, 2024, we operated 2 Company-owned and had 115 licensee-owned\nand 152 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores spread across 36 states and the Philippines.\nIn fiscal year (“FY”) 2024, roughly half of all retail store sales were of the products prepared on premises and the other half were of products purchased from our Durango plant.\nWe believe that in-store product preparation creates a special store ambiance, and the aroma and sight of products being made attracts foot traffic and assures customers that\nproducts are fresh.\nOur principal competitive advantage lies in our brand name recognition, and reputation for the quality, variety and taste of our products. Further, we believe the ambiance of our\nstores, our expertise in the production of chocolate candy products, the merchandising and marketing of confectionary products, and the control and training infrastructures we\nhave implemented to ensure consistent customer service and execution of successful practices and techniques at our stores provides Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory with a\nunique franchise offering.\nWe believe our production expertise and reputation for quality has facilitated the sale of select products through Specialty Markets. We are currently selling our products in a\nselect number of Specialty Markets, including wholesale, fundraising, corporate sales, e-commerce, and private label (collectively “Specialty Markets”).\nOur consolidated revenues in FY 2024 were primarily derived from three principal sources: (i) sales to franchisees and other third parties of chocolates and other confectionery\nproducts produced by us (74%-77%-76% in 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively); (ii) sales at Company-owned stores of chocolates and other confectionery products (including\nproducts produced by us) (5%-3%-4%), and (iii) the collection of initial franchise, royalties and marketing fees from franchisees (21%-20%-20%). For FY 2024, nearly all of\nour revenues were derived from domestic sources, with less than 1% derived from international sources. As described below, the Company sold its frozen yogurt business\nsubsequent to the end of FY 2023.\nSale of Frozen Yogurt Business\nOn May 1, 2023, subsequent to the end of FY 2023, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary and frozen yogurt business, U-Swirl\nInternational, Inc. (“U-Swirl”). The aggregate sale price of U-Swirl was $2.75 million, consisting of (i) $1.75 million in cash and (ii) $1.0 million evidenced by a three-year\nsecured promissory note. The business divestiture of the U-Swirl segment was preceded by a separate sale of our three owned U-Swirl locations on February 24, 2023. With the\nsale of our frozen yogurt segment on May 1, 2023, we continue to focus on our confectionery business to further enhance our competitive position and operating margin,\nsimplify our business model, and deliver sustainable value to our stockholders. The consolidated financial statements present the historical financial results of the former U-\nSwirl segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\", of this Annual Report for information on this divestiture.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur updated long term strategic objective is to build upon the solid market position of our brand and high-quality products to create a world-class experience for consumers of\npremium chocolate and confectionary products, whether in premium confection stores operated by our franchisees or by us, or purchased from us through a variety of other\n3\nTable of Contents\nchannels. We intend to lead this effort through the delivery of an exceptional store experience and development of category leadership through innovation. To accomplish this\nobjective, we will employ a business strategy that includes the elements set forth below.\nProduct Quality and Variety\nWe maintain the gourmet taste and quality of our chocolate products by using the finest chocolate and other wholesome ingredients. We use our proprietary recipes, primarily\ndeveloped by our master candy makers. A typical Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store offers up to 100 of our chocolate products throughout the year and as many as 200,\nincluding many packaged products, during holiday seasons. Individual stores also offer numerous varieties of gourmet caramel apples as well as other products prepared in the\nstore from Company recipes. We continue to enhance our product development and innovation capabilities through the Company’s in-house R&D department.\nStore Atmosphere and Ambiance\nWe seek to establish a fun, enjoyable and inviting atmosphere in each of our store locations. Unlike most other confectionery stores, each Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\nstore prepares numerous products, including caramel apples, in the store. In-store preparation is designed to be both fun and entertaining for customers. We believe the in-store\npreparation and aroma of our products enhances the ambiance at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores, and conveys an image of freshness and homemade quality. We\nhave been, and are committed to, deploying increased resources to our retail store network to further improve the store experience and enhance profitability, all while\nmaintaining brand standards.\nSite Selection\nCareful selection of a new retail site is critical to the success of our stores. We consider many factors in identifying suitable sites, including tenant mix, visibility, attractiveness,\naccessibility, level of foot traffic and occupancy costs. Final site selection occurs only after our senior management has approved the site.\nIncrease Same Store Retail Sales at Existing Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Stores\nWe seek to increase profitability of our store system by increasing sales at existing store locations through a combination of offering the optimal product assortment to stores,\nimproving order fulfillment, facilitating increased product availability to stores through streamlined logistics, and providing Company personnel to help franchised locations\nimprove their sales and profitability. We estimate that a 10% system-wide increase in revenues from our existing store base would be the equivalent of opening 15 new stores.\nChanges in system-wide domestic same store retail sales at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations are as follows:\nFY 2020 compared to FY 2019 0.5%\nFY 2021 compared to FY 2020 (24.8)%\nFY 2022 compared to FY 2021 62.4%\nFY 2023 compared to FY 2022 0.5%\nFY 2024 compared to FY 2023 (1.9)%\nSame store sales declined during FY 2021 primarily as a result of nearly all of the franchise stores being directly and negatively impacted by public health measures taken in\nresponse to COVID-19, with nearly all locations experiencing reduced operations as a result of, among other things, modified business hours and store and mall closures. This\ndecline was offset by a same store sales increase during FY 2022 when store operations resumed normal operations following the initial impacts of COVID-19.\n4\nTable of Contents\nIncreased System-Wide Annual Unit Volume (“AUV”)\nA critical part of success in selling new franchises is the attractiveness of store level economics, which include robust and expanding system-wide annual sales. For FY 2024\nour AUV was approximately $570,000, which represents a 30% increase from the FY 2020 AUV of $437,000.\nEnhanced Operating Efficiencies\nWe have added highly experienced production and supply chain talent in order to bring sustained operating efficiencies to our Durango plant. In addition to such actions as\ninvesting in new and more efficient production equipment, we are rationalizing our portfolio of products and streamlining production lines to reduce labor costs as well as\nimprove product quality and consistency.\nExpansion Strategy\nWe are continually exploring opportunities to grow our brand and expand our business. Key elements of our expansion strategy are set forth below.\nUnit Growth\nWe continue to pursue unit growth opportunities in locations where we have traditionally been successful, by improving and expanding our retail store concepts and product\nportfolio, and by targeting high pedestrian traffic environments.\nHigh Traffic Environments\nWe currently establish franchised stores in the following environments: regional centers, outlet centers, tourist areas, street fronts, airports, other entertainment-oriented\nenvironments and festival and community centers. We have established business relationships with most of the major developers in the United States and believe that these\nrelationships provide us with the opportunity to take advantage of attractive sites in new and existing real estate environments.\nMulti-unit Operators\nWe have historically focused our franchise marketing efforts on single unit operators. By further enhancing our brand strength, product offering, and strong store experience,\ncoupled with enhanced economics, we believe we will be able to appeal more, and market to, multi-unit operators looking to expand their portfolio of franchised opportunities\ninto a premium chocolate franchise concept where we continue to identify substantial interest driven in large part by leased property owners.\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Name Recognition and New Market Penetration\nWe believe the visibility of our stores and the high foot traffic at many of our locations has generated strong name recognition of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and\ndemand for our franchises. The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory system currently is concentrated in the western and Rocky Mountain region of the United States, but growth\n5\nTable of Contents\nhas generated a gradual easterly momentum as new stores have been opened in the eastern half of the country. We believe this growth has further increased our name\nrecognition and demand for our franchises. We believe that distribution of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products through our Specialty Market business also increases\nname recognition and brand awareness in areas of the country in which we have not previously had a significant presence and we believe it will also improve and benefit our\nentire store system.\nWe seek to establish a fun, enjoyable and inviting atmosphere in each of our store locations. Unlike many other confectionery stores, each Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\nstore prepares a variety of products, including caramel apples and fudge, in the store. In FY 2024, approximately one-half of the revenues of franchised stores were generated by\nsales of products prepared on premises. In-store preparation is designed to be both fun and entertaining for customers and we believe the in-store preparation and aroma of our\nproducts enhance the ambiance at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores, conveys an image of freshness and homemade quality.\nThe average store size is approximately 1,000 square feet, approximately 650 square feet of which is selling space. Most stores are open seven days a week.\nIn January 2007, we began testing co-branded locations, such as the co-branded stores with Cold Stone Creamery. Co-branding a location is a vehicle to develop retail\nenvironments that would not typically support a stand-alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store. Co-branding can also be used to more efficiently manage rent structure,\npayroll and other operating costs in environments that have not historically supported stand-alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. As of February 29, 2024, Cold\nStone Creamery franchisees operated 104 co-branded locations, and U-Swirl franchisees operated 11 co-branded locations. As of February 29, 2024, the Company had 3\ninternational units in operation, all within the Republic of the Philippines.\nProducts and Packaging\nWe produce approximately 400 chocolates and other confectionery products using proprietary recipes developed primarily by our master candy makers. These products include\nmany varieties of clusters, caramels, creams, toffees, mints and truffles. These products are offered for sale and also configured into approximately 250 varieties of packaged\nassortments. During the Christmas, Easter and other holiday seasons, we make a variety of seasonal items, including many candies offered in packages, that are specially\ndesigned for holidays. A typical Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store offers up to 100 of these approximately 400 chocolate candies and other confectionery products\nthroughout the year and up to an additional 90 during the holiday seasons. Individual stores also offer more than 15 varieties of caramel apples and other products prepared in\nthe store. In FY 2024, approximately one-half of the revenues of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores were generated by products produced at our Durango production\nfacility, and one-half of products made in individual stores using our recipes and ingredients purchased from us or approved suppliers and with a small amount of products such\nas ice cream, coffee and other sundries purchased from approved suppliers.\nIn FY 2024, approximately 10% of our Durango plant sales resulted from the sale of products outside of our system of franchised and licensed locations, which we refer to as\nSpecialty Market customers, compared with 15% of our Durango plant sales resulting from Specialty Market customers in FY 2023. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related\nto Our Company and Strategy—Our Sales to Specialty Market Customers, Customers Outside Our System of Franchised Stores, Are Concentrated Among a Small Number of\nCustomers.” These products are produced using the same quality ingredients and production processes as the products sold in our network of retail stores.\nWe use the finest chocolates, nutmeats and other wholesome ingredients in our confectionary products and continually strive to offer new items in order to maintain the\nexcitement and appeal of our offerings. We develop special packaging for the holidays and seasonal offerings, and consumers can have their purchases packaged in decorative\nboxes and fancy tins throughout the year.\nOperating Environment\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\nWe currently establish Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in six primary environments: outlet centers, festival and community centers, regional centers, tourist areas,\nstreet fronts, airports and other entertainment-oriented\n6\nTable of Contents\nshopping centers. Each of these environments has a number of attractive features, including high levels of foot traffic. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory domestic franchise\nlocations in operation as of February 29, 2024, include:\nOutlet Centers 19.4%\nFestival/Community Centers 20.8%\nRegional Centers 19.5%\nTourist Areas 20.8%\nStreet Fronts 10.1%\nAirports 5.4%\nOther 4.0%\nOutlet Centers\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were approximately 29 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in outlet centers. We have established business relationships with a number of\nthe major outlet center developers in the United States. Although not all factory outlet centers provide desirable locations for our stores, we believe our relationships with these\ndevelopers will provide us with the opportunity to take advantage of attractive sites in new and existing outlet centers.\nFestival and Community Centers\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were approximately 31 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in festival and community centers. Festival and community centers offer retail\nshopping outside of traditional regional and outlet center shopping.\nRegional Centers\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in approximately 29 regional centers, including a location in the Mall of America in\nBloomington, Minnesota. Although they often provide favorable levels of foot traffic, regional centers typically involve more expensive rent structures and competing food and\nbeverage concepts.\nTourist Areas, Street Fronts, Airports and Other Entertainment-Oriented Shopping Centers\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were approximately 31 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in locations considered to be tourist areas. Tourist areas are very attractive\nlocations because they offer high levels of foot traffic and favorable customer spending characteristics, and greatly increase our visibility and name recognition. We believe\nthere are a number of other environments that have the characteristics necessary for the successful operation of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores such as airports and\ncasinos. As of February 29, 2024, there were 8 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores at airport locations.\nFranchising Program\nGeneral\nWe continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our continued growth. We believe our relationship with our franchisees is\nfundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to maintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees. Our franchising philosophy is one of service and\ncommitment to our franchise system and we continuously seek to improve our franchise support services. Our concept has been rated as an outstanding franchise opportunity by\npublications and organizations rating such opportunities. The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory concept has frequently been ranked in the Top 500 Franchises by\nEntrepreneur Magazine.\nFranchisee Sourcing and Selection\nThe majority of new franchises are awarded to persons referred to us by existing franchisees, to interested consumers who have visited one of our domestic franchise locations\nand to existing franchisees. We also advertise for new\n7\nTable of Contents\nfranchisees in national and regional newspapers and online as suitable potential store locations come to our attention. We are exploring the use of third-party franchise lead\ngenerators to supplement our efforts. Franchisees are currently approved by a committee of the senior executive team based on the applicant's net worth and liquidity, business\nacumen, and prior experience with franchising and/or fast moving consumer goods (“FMCG”), together with an assessment of work ethic and personality compatibility with\nour operating philosophy.\nInternational Franchising and Licensing\nInternational growth is generally achieved through entry into a Master License Agreement covering specific countries, with a licensee that meets minimum qualifications to\ndevelop Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in that country. License agreements are generally entered into for a period of 3-10 years and allow the licensee exclusive\ndevelopment rights in a country. Generally, we require an initial license fee and commitment to a development schedule. Active international license agreements in place\ninclude the following:\n•In October 2014, we entered into a Licensing Agreement in the Republic of the Philippines. As of February 29, 2024, 3 units were operating under the agreement.\nCo-Branding\nIn August 2009, we entered into a Master License Agreement with Kahala Franchise Corp. Under the terms of the agreement, select current and future Cold Stone Creamery\nfranchise stores are co-branded with both the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and the Cold Stone Creamery brands. Locations developed or modified under the agreement\nare subject to the approval of both parties. Locations developed or modified under the agreement will remain franchisees of Cold Stone Creamery and will be licensed to offer\nthe Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand. As of February 29, 2024, Cold Stone Creamery franchisees operated 104 stores under this agreement.\nAdditionally, we allow U-Swirl brands to offer Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products under terms similar to other co-branding agreements. As of February 29, 2024,\nthere were 11 U-Swirl cafés offering Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products.\nTraining and Support\nEach domestic franchisee owner/operator and each store manager for a domestic franchisee is required to complete a comprehensive training program in store operations and\nmanagement. We have established a training center at our Durango headquarters in the form of a full-sized replica of a properly configured and merchandised Rocky Mountain\nChocolate Factory store. Topics covered in the training course include our philosophy of store operation and management, customer service, merchandising, pricing, cooking,\ninventory and cost control, quality standards, record keeping, labor scheduling and personnel management. Training is based on standard operating policies and procedures\ncontained in an operations manual provided to all franchisees, which the franchisee is required to follow by terms of the franchise agreement. Additionally, and importantly,\ntrainees are provided with a complete orientation to our operations by working in key factory operational areas and by meeting with members of our senior management.\nOur operating objectives include providing knowledge and expertise in merchandising, marketing and customer service to all front-line store level employees to maximize their\nskills and ensure that they are fully versed in our operational techniques.\nWe provide ongoing support to franchisees through our field consultants, who maintain regular and frequent communication with the stores by phone and by site visits. The\nfield consultants also review and discuss store operating results with the franchisee and provide advice and guidance in improving store profitability and in developing and\nexecuting store marketing and merchandising programs.\nQuality Standards and Control\nThe franchise agreements for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand franchisees require compliance with our procedures of operation and food quality specifications and\npermit audits and inspections by us.\n8\nTable of Contents\nOperating standards for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand stores are set forth in operating manuals. These manuals cover general operations, factory ordering,\nmerchandising, advertising and accounting procedures. Through their regular visits to franchised stores, our field consultants audit performance and adherence to our brand\nstandards. We have the right to terminate any franchise agreement for non‑compliance with our operating standards. Products sold at the stores and ingredients used in the\npreparation of products approved for on-site preparation must be purchased from us or from approved suppliers.\nThe Franchise Agreement: Terms and Conditions\nThe domestic offer and sales of our franchise concepts are made pursuant to the respective franchise disclosure document (FDD) prepared in accordance with federal and state\nlaws and regulations. States that regulate the sale and operation of franchises require a franchisor to register or file certain notices with the state authorities prior to offering and\nselling franchises in those states.\nUnder the current form of our domestic franchise agreements, franchisees pay us (i) an initial franchise fee for each store, (ii) royalties based on monthly gross sales, and (iii) a\nmarketing fee based on monthly gross sales. Franchisees are generally granted exclusive territory with respect to the operation of their stores only in the immediate vicinity of\ntheir stores. Chocolate products not made on premises by franchisees must be purchased from us or approved suppliers. The franchise agreements require franchisees to comply\nwith our procedures of operation and food quality specifications, to permit inspections and audits by us and to remodel stores to conform with standards then in effect. We may\nterminate the franchise agreement upon the failure of the franchisee to comply with the conditions of the agreement and upon the occurrence of certain events, such as\ninsolvency or bankruptcy of the franchisee or the commission by the franchisee of any unlawful or deceptive practice, which in our judgment is likely to adversely affect the\nnetwork system. Our ability to terminate franchise agreements pursuant to such provisions is subject to applicable bankruptcy and state laws and regulations. See “Regulation”\nbelow for additional information.\nThe agreements prohibit the transfer or assignment of any interest in a franchise without our prior written consent. The agreements also give us a right of first refusal to purchase\nany interest in a franchise if a proposed transfer would result in a change of control of that franchise. The refusal right, if exercised, would allow us to purchase the interest\nproposed to be transferred under the same terms and conditions and for the same price as offered by the proposed transferee.\nThe term of franchise agreements signed before July 1, 2023 is ten years, and franchisees have the right to renew for one additional ten-year term. The term of franchise\nagreements signed after July 1, 2023 is ten years, and franchisees have the right to renew for two additional five-year terms. Our revised Franchise Agreement offers a flat\nroyalty payment on all retail stores sales ranging from 6% to as low as 4% based upon the retail sales mix of Durango produced product sold in comparison to all retail store\nsales. These terms are only effective with Franchise Agreements entered into after July 1, 2023 or when a current franchise operator agrees to enter into a new agreement with\nthe Company\nFranchise Financing\nWe do not typically provide prospective franchisees with financing for their stores for new or existing franchises, but we have developed relationships with several sources of\nfranchisee financing to whom we will refer franchisees. Typically, franchisees have obtained their own sources of such financing and have not required our assistance. In the\nnormal course of business, we extend credit to customers, primarily franchisees that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria, for inventory and other operational costs.\nIn select instances, we have provided limited financing to franchisees. As a result, as of February 29, 2024, we have approximately $0.2 million of notes receivable as a result of\nfinancing our franchisees. When we finance franchisees the notes are secured by the assets financed.\nCompany Store Operations\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were two Company-owned Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. Our flagship store, located in Durango, Colorado, (“Flagship Store”)\nprovides a training ground for Company personnel and a controllable testing ground for new products and promotions, operating and training methods and merchandising\ntechniques, which may then be incorporated into the franchise store operations.\n9\nTable of Contents\nProduction Operations\nGeneral\nWe manufacture our chocolate and confectionary products at our production facility in Durango, Colorado. All products are produced consistent with our philosophy of using\nthe finest high-quality ingredients to achieve our marketing motto of “The Peak of Perfection in Handmade Chocolates®.”\nWe have always believed that we should control the production of our own chocolate products. By controlling operations and production, we are able to better maintain our high\nquality standards, offer unique proprietary products, control production and shipment schedules and potentially pursue new or under-utilized distribution channels.\nProduction Processes\nThe production process primarily involves cooking or preparing candy centers, including nuts, caramel, peanut butter, creams and jellies, and then coating them with chocolate\nor other toppings. All of these processes are conducted in carefully controlled temperature ranges, and we employ strict quality control procedures at every stage of the\nproduction process. We use a combination of manual and automated processes at production facility. Although we believe that it is currently preferable to perform certain\nproduction processes, such as the dipping of some large pieces by hand, automation increases the speed and efficiency of the production process. We have from time-to-time\nautomated certain processes formerly performed by hand where it has become cost-effective for us to do so without compromising product quality or appearance.\nWe also seek to ensure the freshness of products sold in Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores with frequent shipments. Most Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores do\nnot have significant space for the storage of inventory, and we encourage franchisees and store managers to order only the quantities that they can reasonably expect to sell\nwithin approximately two to four weeks. For these reasons, we generally do not have a significant backlog of orders.\nThe production and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food\nand Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as\nwell as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the U.S.\nWe have a product quality and safety program. This program is integral to our supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase, produce, and\ndistribute are safe, are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Through our product quality and safety program, we evaluate our supply chain including\ningredients, packaging, processes, products, distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary. We follow the FDA\nmandated Hazard Analysis and Risk-based Preventive Controls which includes a 12-step process to determine risks based on individual processes. To support this hazard\nanalysis model, and in accordance with private and federal mandated requirements, we also adhere to all good manufacturing practices (\"GMPs\") including several supporting\npolicies and procedures that ensure all risks identified are in control. Various government agencies and third-party firms, as well as our quality assurance staff, conduct audits of\nall facilities that produce our products to ensure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations.\nIngredients\nThe principal ingredients used in our products are chocolate, nuts, sugar, corn syrup, cream and butter. Our production facility receives shipments of ingredients daily. To ensure\nthe consistency of our products, we buy ingredients from a limited number of reliable suppliers. In order to ensure a continuous supply of chocolate and certain nuts, we\nfrequently enter into purchase contracts of between six to eighteen months for these products. Because prices for these products may fluctuate, we may benefit if prices rise\nduring the terms of these contracts, but we may be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall. We have one or more alternative sources for most essential ingredients and\ntherefore believe that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We currently purchase small amounts of\nfinished candy from third parties on a private label basis for sale in Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. As a result of recent macro-economic inflationary trends and\ndisruptions to the global supply chain, we have experienced and may continue to experience higher raw material, labor, and freight costs.\n10\nTable of Contents\nTrucking Operations\nWe operate eight trucks and ship a substantial portion of our products from the production facility on our own fleet. Our trucking operations enable us to deliver our products to\nthe stores quickly and cost-effectively. In addition, we back-haul our own ingredients and supplies, as well as products from third parties, on return trips, which helps achieve\neven greater efficiencies and cost savings.\nMarketing\nGeneral\nWe rely primarily on in-store promotion and point-of-purchase materials to promote the sale of our products. The monthly marketing fees collected from franchisees are used by\nus to develop new packaging and in-store promotion and point-of-purchase materials, and to create and update our local store marketing guides and materials.\nWe focus on local store marketing efforts by providing customizable marketing materials, including advertisements, coupons, flyers and brochures generated by our in-house\nCreative Services department. The department works directly with franchisees to implement local store marketing programs.\nWe have not historically, and do not intend to, engage in national traditional media advertising in the near future. Consistent with our commitment to community support, we\nseek opportunities to participate in local and regional events, sponsorships and charitable causes. This support leverages low-cost, high return publicity opportunities for mutual\ngain partnerships.\nInternet and Social Media\nWe’ve initiated a program to leverage the marketing benefits of various social media outlets. These lower-cost marketing opportunities leverage the positive feedback of our\ncustomers, expanding brand awareness through a customer’s network of contacts. Complementary to local store marketing efforts, these networks also provide a medium for us\nto communicate regularly and authentically with customers. When possible, we work to facilitate direct relationships between our franchisees and their customers. We use\nsocial media as a tool to build brand recognition, increase repeat exposure, and enhance dialogue with consumers about their preferences and needs. The majority of stores have\nlocation-specific Facebook® and Instagram® accounts dedicated to helping customers interact directly with their local store. Proceeds from the monthly marketing fees\ncollected from franchisees are used by us to facilitate and assist stores in managing their online presence consistent with our brand and marketing efforts.\nCompetition\nThe retailing of confectionery products is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with numerous businesses that offer products similar to those offered by our\nretail stores and Specialty Markets. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, there is intense\ncompetition among retailers for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores, store personnel and qualified franchisees.\nWe believe that our principal competitive strengths lie in our name recognition and our reputation for the quality, value, variety and taste of our products and the ambiance of\nour stores; our knowledge and experience in applying criteria for the selection of new store locations; our expertise in merchandising and marketing of chocolate and other\nconfectionary products; and the control and training infrastructures we have implemented to ensure execution of successful practices and techniques at our retail store locations.\nIn addition, by controlling the production of our own confectionary products, we can better maintain our high product quality standards for those products, offer proprietary\nproducts, manage costs, control production and shipment schedules and pursue new or under-utilized distribution channels.\n11\nTable of Contents\nTrade Name and Trademarks\nThe trade name “Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory®,” the phrases, “The Peak of Perfection in Handmade Chocolates®”, “America's Chocolatier®” as well as all other\ntrademarks, service marks, symbols, slogans, emblems, logos and designs used in the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory system, are our proprietary rights. We believe all of\nthe foregoing are of material importance to our business. The trademark “Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory” is registered in the United States and Canada. Applications to\nregister the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory trademark have been filed and/or obtained in certain foreign countries.\nWe have not attempted to obtain patent protection for the proprietary recipes developed by our master candy-maker and instead rely upon our ability to maintain the\nconfidentiality of those recipes.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are not aware of any federal, state, local or international environmental laws or regulations that we expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result\nin material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations on our operations. During FY 2024, we had no\nmaterial environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in FY 2025.\nSeasonal Factors\nOur sales and earnings are seasonal, with significantly higher sales and earnings occurring during key holidays, such as Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day, and the U.S.\nsummer vacation season than at other times of the year, which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the\nfuture are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings, the sale of franchises and the timing of purchases by customers outside our network of franchised locations.\nBecause of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.\nRegulation\nOur two current Company-owned and other franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores are subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety,\nbuilding and fire agencies in the state or municipality where located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licensing or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of\nnew stores. New stores must also comply with landlord and developer criteria.\nMany states have laws regulating franchise operations, including registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises. We are also subject to the Federal\nTrade Commission regulations relating to disclosure requirements in the sale of franchises and ongoing disclosure obligations.\nAdditionally, certain states have enacted and others may enact laws and regulations governing the termination or non-renewal of franchises and other aspects of the franchise\nrelationship that are intended to protect franchisees, including among other things, limitation on the duration and scope of non-competition provisions applicable to franchisees.\nAlthough these laws and regulations, and related court decisions, may limit our ability to terminate franchises and alter franchise agreements, we do not believe that such laws\nor decisions will have a material adverse effect on our franchise operations. However, the laws applicable to franchise operations and relationships continue to develop, and we\nare unable to predict the effect on our intended operations of additional requirements or restrictions that may be enacted or of court decisions that may be adverse to franchisors.\nFederal and state environmental regulations have not had a material impact on our operations but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with\nrespect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay the construction of new stores, increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our earnings and\nnegatively impact our competitive position.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCompanies engaged in the production, packaging and distribution of food products are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental agencies. A finding of failure to\ncomply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of all or a portion of our facilities for an indeterminate period of time. Our\nproduct labeling is subject to and complies with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 and the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004.\nWe provide a limited amount of trucking services to third parties, to fill available space on our trucks. Our trucking operations are subject to various federal and state\nregulations, including regulations of the Federal Highway Administration and other federal and state agencies applicable to motor carriers, safety requirements of the\nDepartment of Transportation relating to interstate transportation and federal, state and Canadian provincial regulations governing matters such as vehicle weight and\ndimensions.\nWe believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of February 29, 2024, we employed approximately 160 people, including 135 full-time employees. Most employees, with the exception of store management, production\nmanagement and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. We also employ some individuals on a temporary basis during peak periods of store and factory\noperations. We seek to ensure that participatory management processes, mutual respect and professionalism and high-performance expectations for the employees exist\nthroughout the organization. We believe that we provide working conditions, wages and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Our employees are not\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.\nOur franchisees are independent business owners, their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count.\nLabor and Supply Chain\nAs a result of recent macroeconomic inflationary trends and disruptions to the global supply chain, we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing higher raw\nmaterial, labor, and freight costs. We have seen labor and logistics challenges, which we believe have contributed to lower production facility, retail, and e-commerce sales of\nour products due to the availability of material, labor, and freight. In addition, we could experience additional lost sales opportunities if our products are not available for\npurchase as a result of continued disruptions in our supply chain relating to an inability to obtain ingredients or packaging, labor challenges at our logistics providers or our\nproduction facility, or if we or our franchisees experience delays in stocking our products. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” for a discussion of recent business developments.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 265 Turner Drive, Durango, Colorado 81303, and our telephone number is (970) 259-0554.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business, results of operations and financial position are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our common stock. The\nfollowing risk factors, which we believe represent the most significant factors that may make an investment in our common stock risky, may cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report,\nincluding the information set forth in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and\nFinancial Position,” when evaluating an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Specific to Our Company and the Industry in Which We Operate\nOur Sales To Specialty Market Customers, Customers Outside Our System Of Franchised Stores, Are Concentrated Among A Small Number Of Customers.\nThe Company has historically sold its product to relatively few customers outside its network of franchised and licensed locations (Specialty Market customers).\nDuring FY 2024 our sales to Specialty Market customers were approximately $2.7 million or 10% of our total revenue.\nThe Divestiture Of Our U-Swirl Business May Have Material Adverse Effects On Our Financial Condition, Results Of Operations Or Cash Flows.\nIn May 2023, subsequent to our fiscal year-end, we announced that we had completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of U-Swirl, our wholly-owned subsidiary and\nfrozen yogurt business. The consummation of the sale of the U-Swirl business involves risks, including retention of uncertain contingent liabilities related to the divested\nbusiness and risks associated with the collection of notes receivable contemplated in the sale, any of which could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition,\nresults of operations or cash flows. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter as a result of divesting the\nU-Swirl business.\nOur Growth Is Dependent Upon Attracting And Retaining Qualified Franchisees And Their Ability To Operate Their Franchised Stores Successfully.\nOur continued growth and success are dependent in part upon our ability to attract, retain and contract with qualified franchisees. Our growth is dependent upon the ability of\nfranchisees to operate their stores successfully, promote and develop our store concepts, and maintain our reputation for an enjoyable in-store experience and high-quality\nproducts. Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees and have been successful in attracting franchisees, there can be no assurance that franchisees\nwill be able to operate successfully in their franchise areas in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards. As a result, we may realize a reduction in number of units in\noperation or fail to achieve our opening targets.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIncreases In Costs Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nInflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients, energy and labor directly affect our operations. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and\nrequire us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease costs for new facilities may reflect potentially\nescalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on our increased costs to our customers or that our customers will continue to\npurchase at historical levels in the event that we pass along cost increases in the form of higher prices. If we are unable to pass along cost increases we may realize a decrease in\ngross margin on products we sell and produce.\nPrice Increases May Not Be Sufficient To Offset Cost Increases And Maintain Profitability Or May Result In Sales Volume Declines Associated With Pricing\nElasticity.\nWe may be able to pass some or all raw materials, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products, however, higher product\nprices may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to increase our selling prices sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased\nraw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a\nnegative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Expansion Plans Are Dependent On The Availability Of Suitable Sites For Franchised Stores At Reasonable Occupancy Costs.\nOur expansion plans are critically dependent on our ability to obtain suitable sites for franchised stores at reasonable occupancy costs for our franchised stores in high foot\ntraffic retail environments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain suitable locations for our franchised stores in this environment at a cost that will allow such\nstores to be economically viable.\nSame Store Sales Have Fluctuated and Will Continue to Fluctuate.\nOur same store sales, defined as year-over-year sales for a store that has been open for at least one year, have fluctuated in the past on an annual and quarterly basis and are\nexpected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Sustained declines in same store sales or significant same store sales declines in any single period could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations. Same store sales declined during FY 2021 and established the large negative percentage changes reflected above, primarily as a result of\nnearly all of the franchise stores being directly and negatively impacted by public health measures taken in response to COVID-19, with nearly all locations experiencing\nreduced operations as a result of, among other things, modified business hours and store and mall closures. Same store sales increased during FY 2022 and established the large\npositive percentage changes reflected above, primarily as a result of nearly all of the franchise stores being directly and positively impacted by a resurgence in consumer\ndemand following the relaxing of many public health measures taken in response to COVID-19. If same store sales decline, we may experience a decrease in demand for\nproducts we sell and a decrease in revenue from royalty and marketing fees.\nHigher Labor Costs, Increased Competition For Qualified Team Members And Ensuring Adequate Staffing Increases The Cost Of Doing Business. Additionally,\nChanges In Employment And Labor Laws, Including Health Care Legislation And Minimum Wage Increases, Could Increase Costs For Our System-Wide\nOperations.\nOur success depends in part on our and our franchisees’ ability to recruit, motivate, train and retain a qualified workforce to work in our stores in an intensely competitive\nenvironment. We and our franchisees have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for stores positions due to job market trends and conditions, which\ncould decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Our ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our stores and factory has been impacted by these\ntrends and conditions, and we expect staffing and labor challenges to continue into 2025. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified\nemployees to work in the Company-owned stores, franchised stores and our production facility have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our Company-owned\nstore and production margins and the margins of franchised stores. Competition for qualified drivers for both our stores and supply-chain function also continues to increase as\n15\nTable of Contents\nmore companies compete for drivers or enter the delivery space, including third party aggregators. Additionally, economic actions, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or\ncampaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers. Social media may be used to\nfoster negative perceptions of employment with our Company in particular or in our industry generally, and to promote strikes or boycotts.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation, benefits, working conditions, citizenship\nrequirements and discrimination and family and medical leave and employee related litigation. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of\noperation. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase our system-wide labor costs.\nA significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates at or above the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, the enactment of additional state or local\nminimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations related to exempt employees has increased and could continue to increase labor costs for our domestic system-\nwide operations. A significant increase in the federal minimum wage requirement could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Seasonality Of Our Sales And New Store Openings Can Have A Significant Impact On Our Financial Results From Quarter To Quarter.\nOur sales and earnings are seasonal, with significantly higher sales and earnings occurring during key holidays and summer vacation season than at other times of the year,\nwhich causes fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store\nopenings and the sale of franchises. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.\nThe Retailing Of Confectionery Products Is Highly Competitive And Many Of Our Competitors Have Competitive Advantages Over Us.\nThe retailing of confectionery products is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with numerous businesses that offer similar products. Many of these competitors\nhave greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, there is intense competition among retailers for real estate sites, store\npersonnel and qualified franchisees. Competitive market conditions could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations and our ability to expand\nsuccessfully.\nChanges In Consumer Tastes And Trends Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Operations.\nThe sale of our products is affected by changes in consumer tastes and health concerns, including views regarding the consumption of chocolate. Numerous other factors that we\ncannot control, such as economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and weather conditions, influence the sale of our products. Changes in any of these factors\ncould have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nWe Are Subject To Federal, State And Local Regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and must comply with certain state laws governing the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to\nrenew franchises. Many state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship by, for example, requiring the franchisor to deal with its franchisees\nin good faith, prohibiting interference with the right of free association among franchisees and regulating discrimination among franchisees in charges, royalties or fees.\nFranchise laws continue to develop and change, and changes in such laws could impose additional costs and burdens on franchisors. Our failure to obtain approvals to sell\nfranchises and the adoption of new franchise laws, or changes in existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nEach of our Company-owned and franchised stores is subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality\nwhere located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required licenses or approvals from such agencies could delay or prevent the opening of a new store. We and our\n16\nTable of Contents\nfranchisees are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions and\ncitizenship requirements. Because a significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the state minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage would increase\nour labor costs. The failure to obtain required licenses or approvals, or an increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefits costs (including costs associated with mandated\nhealth insurance coverage) or other costs associated with employees, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nCompanies engaged in the production, packaging and distribution of food products are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental agencies. A finding of failure to\ncomply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of all or a portion of our facilities for an indeterminate period of time, and\ncould have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nInformation Technology System Failures, Breaches Of Our Network Security Or Inability To Upgrade Or Expand Our Technological Capabilities Could Interrupt\nOur Operations And Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe and our franchisees rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale (POS) processing at our stores. Our and our\nfranchisees’ operations depend upon our and our franchisees’ ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss,\ntelecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external cybersecurity breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. Any damage or\nfailure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us or our\nfranchisees to litigation or to actions by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks increased in FY 2021 and\ncontinued into FY 2022, FY 2023 and FY 2024 due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our infrastructure could, among other things, misappropriate our proprietary\ninformation and the personal information of our customers and employees, cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our franchisee’s operations, cause delays or\ninterruptions to our ability to operate, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or\ncause other disruptions in our operations. These breaches may result from human errors, equipment failure, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties.\nWe expend financial resources to protect against such threats and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic, and\ncyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target,\nregardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could\nbe circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to an increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers, harm to our reputation and\nincreases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.\nIn the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for\ndamages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data\nprivacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.\nWe are also continuing to expand, upgrade and develop our information technology capabilities, including our point-of-sale systems, as well as the adoption of cloud services\nfor e-mail, intranet, and file storage. If we are unable to successfully upgrade or expand our technological capabilities, we may not be able to take advantage of market\nopportunities, manage our costs and transactional data effectively, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. Additionally,\nunforeseen problems with our point-of-sale system may affect our operational abilities and internal controls and we may incur additional costs in connection with such upgrades\nand expansion.\nIf We, Our Business Partners, Or Our Franchisees Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’ Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, Liability And\nReputational Damage.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with credit and debit card sales, we and our franchisees transmit confidential credit and debit card information by way of secure private retail networks. A number\nof retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. Although we and our franchisees use private\nnetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and\nour and our franchisees’ security measures and those of our and our franchisees’ technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this\ninformation. If a person were able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our and our franchisees’ operations.\nAny security breach could expose us and our franchisees to risks of data loss and liability and could seriously disrupt our and our franchisees’ operations and any resulting\nnegative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings\nrelated to the theft of credit and debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks, and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or\nas part of a class action lawsuit), and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could harm our reputation, distract our management team members from running our\nbusiness and cause us to incur significant unplanned liabilities, losses and expenses.\nWe also sell and accept for payment gift cards, and our customer loyalty program provides rewards that can be redeemed for purchases. Like credit and debit cards, gift cards,\nand rewards earned by our customers are vulnerable to theft, whether physical or electronic. We believe that, due to their electronic nature, rewards earned through our customer\nloyalty program are primarily vulnerable to hacking. Customers affected by any loss of data or funds could litigate against us, and security breaches or even unsuccessful\nattempts at hacking could harm our reputation, and guarding against or responding to hacks could require significant time and resources.\nWe also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers, including information received through our marketing programs, franchisees and business\npartners. Our collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure and security of this information is regulated by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations. If our\nsecurity and information systems are compromised or our employees fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or\nused inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as the results of operations, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In\naddition, our ability to accept credit and debit cards as payment in our stores and online depends on us maintaining our compliance status with standards set by the PCI Security\nStandards Council. These standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers’\ncredit and debit card information as well as other personal information. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change over time, and compliance with those\nchanges may result in cost increases due to necessary system and process changes.\nWe Are Subject To Periodic Litigation, Which Could Result In Unexpected Expenses Of Time And Resources.\nFrom time to time, we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict\nthe ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any current or future legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, and financial\nresults. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\nAny litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nChanges In Health Benefit Claims And Healthcare Reform Legislation Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Operations.\nWe accrue for costs to provide self-insured benefits for our employee health benefits program. We accrue for self-insured health benefits based on historical claims experience\nand we maintain insurance coverage to prevent financial losses from catastrophic health benefit claims. We monitor pending and enacted legislation in an effort to evaluate the\neffects of such legislation upon our business. Our financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted should we experience a material increase in\nclaims costs or a change in healthcare legislation that impacts our business.\nOur Expansion Into New Markets May Present Increased Risks Due To Our Unfamiliarity With Those Areas And Our Target Customers’ Unfamiliarity With Our\nBrands.\n18\nTable of Contents\nConsumers in any new markets we enter will not be familiar with our brands, and we will need to build brand awareness in those markets through significant investments in\nadvertising and promotional activity. We may find it more difficult in new markets to secure desirable locations and to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees.\nIssues Or Concerns Related To The Quality And Safety Of Our Products, Ingredients Or Packaging Could Cause A Product Recall And/Or Result In Harm To The\nCompany’s Reputation, Negatively Impacting Our Results Of Operations.\nIn order to sell our products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or\npackaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product\ntampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products\nbecome unfit for consumption. In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs\nassociated with these potential actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By The Failure To Successfully Execute Or Integrate Acquisitions, Divestitures And Joint Ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part,\nupon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable,\nobtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention\nfrom existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may\nnot achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there\ncould be a negative impact on our results of operations.\nProvisions In Our Organizational Documents, As Well As Provisions Of Delaware Law, Could Make It More Difficult Or Costly For A Third Party To Acquire Us,\nEven If Doing So Would Benefit Our Stockholders, And Could Limit Attempts To Make Changes In Our Management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us\nwithout the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include the following:\n•Authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the\nBoard of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n•Establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a\nmeeting;\n•Prohibit stockholder actions by written consent, which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n•Require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and to amend our bylaws.\nAlthough we believe all of these provisions will make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the Board of Directors, these\nprovisions will apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and therefore could delay and/or prevent a deemed beneficial offer from being\nconsidered. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may\nprevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in\n19\nTable of Contents\nmanagement that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur Common Stock Price May Be Volatile Or May Decline Regardless Of Our Operating Performance.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors, which are\noutside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and this Annual Report, as\nwell as the following:\n•Our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n•Our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n•Conditions that impact demand at our stores and for our products;\n•Future announcements concerning our business or our competitors’ businesses;\n•The public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n•The size of our public float, and the trading volume of our common stock;\n•Coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n•Market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n•Strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n•Changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n•Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n•Changes in senior management or key personnel;\n•Issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n•Changes in our dividend policy;\n•Adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n•Changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters,\nterrorist attacks, pandemics, public health crises, acts of war and responses to such events.\nAs a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for such shares.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may\nbe greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nOur Auditor’s Opinion on Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended February 29, 2024, included in this Annual Report, Contains an\nExplanatory Paragraph Relating to our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nDuring the year ended February 29, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $4.2 million and used cash in operating activities of $2.4 million. In addition, at February 29, 2024, we were\nin violation of a debt covenant for our $1.25 million outstanding line of credit where the lender can demand repayment. These factors raise substantial doubts about our ability\nto continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the consolidated financial statements included\n20\nTable of Contents\nin this Annual Report are issued. Our auditor’s opinion on our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2024 includes an explanatory\nparagraph stating that our losses and negative cash flows from operations and uncertainty in generating sufficient cash to meet our operating obligations raise substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. While we are considering a variety of funding sources and transactions that could raise capital, there can be no assurances that\nwe will be successful in these efforts or will be able to resolve our liquidity issues or eliminate our operating losses. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we would need\nto significantly reduce our operating plans and curtail some or all of our strategic plans. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will\nbe materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets\nand may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their\ninvestment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,\ninvestors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur Inability to Meet a Financial Covenant Contained in our Revolving Credit Facility May Adversely Affect our Liquidity, Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\nPursuant to a credit agreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the “Lender”), we have a $4.0 million credit line for general corporate and\nworking capital purposes, of which $2.75 million was available for borrowing (subject to certain borrowing-based limitations) as of February 29, 2024 (the “Credit Line”). The\nCredit Line is secured by substantially all of our assets, except retail store assets. Interest on borrowings is at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2.37% (7.69% at\nFebruary 29, 2024 and 6.92% at February 28, 2023). Additionally, the Credit Line is subject to various financial ratio and leverage covenants.\nAs of February 29, 2024, we were not in compliance with the requirement under the Credit Agreement to maintain a ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities of at\nleast 1.5 to 1. Our current ratio as of February 29, 2024 was 1.19 to 1. In the past, we have requested, and the Lender has granted, waivers of our compliance with this\nrequirement. We have requested a waiver from the Lender, but we have not yet received approval. There can be no assurance that the Lender will grant us a waiver for our\ncurrent noncompliance or waivers for future noncompliance.\nAs a result of our noncompliance, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lender has the option, but not the obligation, to immediately demand repayment of all funds\ndrawn down under the Credit Line. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have enough cash on hand to satisfy our obligations under the Credit Line if the Lender\nexercised its option to demand repayment. If the Lender exercises its option and demands repayment at some time in the future, however, we may not have sufficient funds\navailable to make the payments required. If we are unable to repay amounts owed, the Lender may be entitled to foreclose on and sell substantially all of our assets, which\nsecure our borrowings under the Credit Agreement which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Lender retains the right to act on covenant violations that occur after the date of delivery of any waiver. If the Lender were to decline to grant us a waiver and\ninstead demand repayment in the future, we may need to seek alternative financing to pay these obligations as we may not have sufficient facilities or sufficient cash on hand at\nthat time to satisfy these obligations.\nRisks Related to the Economy\nGlobal Or Regional Health Pandemics Or Epidemics Could Negatively Impact Our Business Operations, Financial Performance And Results Of Operations.\nOur business and financial results could be negatively impacted by pandemics or epidemics. The severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics\nare uncertain and hard to predict. COVID-19 significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and resulted in broader supply, transportation and labor\ndisruptions resulting in inflation and generally higher operating costs in our business. Relatedly, commodity and transportation costs have become more volatile and generally\nincreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, as have supply chain disruptions, and transportation and labor shortages. Additionally, government or regulatory responses to\npandemics could negatively impact our business. Mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some\n21\nTable of Contents\ncountries temporarily disrupted our ability to distribute our products in some markets. Resumption, continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely\nimpact our operations and results.\nThese and other impacts of global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors presented\nin this filing, including but not limited to those relating to our reputation, brands, consumer preferences, supply chain, product sales, pricing actions, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. The ultimate impact\nof these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of other pandemics or epidemics and actions taken by parties\nother than us to respond to them. Any of these disruptions could have a negative impact on our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price,\nand this impact could be material.\nGeneral Economic Conditions Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Results Of Operations And Liquidity Or Our Franchisees, With Adverse\nConsequences To Us.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, often decline during weak economic periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our\nperformance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions, including employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on severe market declines,\nresidential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, public health, the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign\ncurrencies and other macroeconomic factors. These factors may cause consumers to purchase products from lower priced competitors or to defer purchases of discretionary\nproducts altogether.\nEconomic weakness could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. It could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in us\nbecoming more reliant on external financing, the availability and terms of which may be uncertain. In addition, a weak economic environment may exacerbate the other risks\nnoted below.\nWe rely in large part on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their stores to develop and promote our business. It is possible that additional franchisees could\nfile for bankruptcy, become delinquent in their payments to us, or simply shut down which could have a significant adverse impact on our business due to loss of factory sales\nand loss or delay in payments of royalties, contributions to our marketing fund and other fees. Additionally, the availability of credit to our small business franchisees may be\ncurtailed due to tighter credit conditions in the marketplace, and as a result could delay or preclude franchisees from making required store upgrades.\nAlthough we have developed, and continue to develop, evolving criteria to evaluate and screen prospective developers and franchisees, we cannot be certain that the developers\nand franchisees we select will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to open and operate successful franchises in their franchise areas, and state franchise\nlaws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise arrangements. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our\nstandards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. The failure of developers and franchisees to open and operate franchises\nsuccessfully could have a material adverse effect on us, our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees and could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe Currently, And May In The Future, Have Assets Held At Financial Institutions That May Exceed The Insurance Coverage Offered By The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”), The Loss Of Which Would Have A Severe Negative Affect On Our Operations And Liquidity.\nWe may maintain our cash assets at financial institutions in the U.S. in amounts that may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. In the event of a failure or\nliquidity issues at any of the financial institutions where we maintain our deposits or other assets, we may incur a loss to the extent such loss exceeds the FDIC insurance\nlimitation, which could have a material adverse effect upon our liquidity, financial condition and our results of operations. Similarly, if our customers or partners experience\nliquidity issues as a result of financial institution defaults or non-performance where they hold cash assets, their ability to pay us may become impaired and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, including the collection of accounts receivable and cash flows.\n22\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Franchisees\nThe Financial Performance Of Our Franchisees Can Negatively Impact Our Business.\nOur financial results are dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. Franchisees purchase product from us and we receive royalties,\nfranchise fees, contributions to our marketing fund, and other fees from our franchisees. We have established operational standards and guidelines for our franchisees; however,\nwe have limited control over how our franchisees’ businesses are run. While we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire system of stores and for taking a longer-\nterm view with respect to system improvements, our franchisees have individual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our franchisees may\nnot be able to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales\ntrends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, our franchisees could experience financial distress or even bankruptcy. If a significant number of franchisees\nbecome financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalty revenues and the impact on our profitability could be greater than the percentage\ndecrease in the royalty revenues. This would reduce our royalty revenues and could negatively impact margins, since we may not be able to reduce fixed costs which we\ncontinue to incur.\nWe Have Limited Control With Respect To The Operations Of Our Franchisees, Which Could Have A Negative Impact On Our Business.\nFranchisees are independent business operators and are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of their stores. We provide training\nand support to franchisees, and set and monitor operational standards, but the quality of franchised stores may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control.\nConsequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and\nother store personnel. If franchisees do not operate to our expectations, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and\nsystem-wide sales could decline significantly, which would reduce our royalty revenues, and the impact on profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in\nroyalties and fees.\nA Significant Shift By Franchisees From Company-Manufactured Products To Products Produced By Third Parties Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nIn FY 2024, approximately one-half of the revenues of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores were generated by products produced at our Durango production facility, and\none-half of products made in individual stores using our recipes and ingredients purchased from us or approved suppliers and with a small amount of products such as ice cream,\ncoffee and other sundries purchased from approved suppliers. Franchisees' sales of products produced by us generate higher revenues to us than sales of store-made or other\nproducts. We have seen a significant increase in system-wide sales of store-made and other products, which has led to a decrease in purchases from us and has had an adverse\neffect on our revenues. If this trend continues, it could further adversely affect our total revenues and results of operations. Such a decrease could result from franchisees'\ndecisions to sell more store-made products or products purchased from approved third party suppliers.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nIncrease In Ingredient And Other Operating Costs, Including Those Caused By Weather And Food Safety, Could Adversely Affect Our Results Of Operations.\nOur Company-owned and franchised stores could also be harmed by supply chain interruptions including those caused by factors beyond our control or the control of our\nsuppliers. However, prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our manufacturing facility due to weather, natural disasters, food safety incidents, regulatory\ncompliance, labor dispute or interruption of service by carriers could increase costs, limit the availability of ingredients critical to our store operations and have a significant\nimpact on results. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our\ningredients, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain. In particular, adverse weather or cocoa beans or nuts shortages could disrupt the supply of key ingredients\nto our and our franchisees’ stores. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nDisruption To Our Manufacturing Facility Or Supply Chain Could Impair Our Ability To Produce Or Deliver Finished Products, Resulting In A Negative Impact\nOn Our Results Of Operations.\nAll of our manufacturing operations are located in Durango, Colorado. Disruption to our manufacturing facility or to our supply chain could result from a number of factors,\nincluding natural disasters, pandemics, outbreak of disease, weather, fire or explosion, terrorism or other acts of violence, labor strikes or other labor activities, unavailability of\nraw or packaging materials, and operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers and other vendors or service providers. We believe that we take adequate precautions to\nmitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur. However, if we are unable, or find that it is\nnot financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing facility or supply chain, our financial condition\nand results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification and management of, and planning for, risks from cybersecurity threats.\nWe are developing processes, that seek to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to the IT systems and information that we use or will use,\ntransmit, receive, and maintain. The processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats include our efforts to identify the relevant\nassets that could be affected, determine possible threat sources and threat events, assess threats based on their potential likelihood and impact, and identify controls that are in\nplace or necessary to manage and/or mitigate such risks.\nWe have not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents, and the expenses incurred from any security incidents have been immaterial. However, as discussed under “Risk\nFactors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report, cybersecurity threats pose multiple and potentially material risks to us, including potentially to our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risk. As cybersecurity threats become more frequent, sophisticated,\nand coordinated, it is reasonably likely that we may expend greater resources to continue to modify and enhance protective measures against such security risks\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur production operations and corporate headquarters are located at 265 Turner Drive, Durango, Colorado 81303, which is a 53,000 square foot manufacturing facility that we\nown. During FY 2024, our manufacturing operations produced approximately 1.61 million pounds of chocolate products, which was a decrease of approximately 4.7% from the\napproximately 1.69 million pounds produced in FY 2023. In addition to our production facility, we own a two-acre parcel adjacent to our production facility.\nAs of February 29, 2024, the Company had obligations for one non-cancelable lease for our Flagship Store having an expiration date of January 31, 2026, which contains an\noptional ten-year renewal right. We do not deem this store lease to be material in relation to our overall operations.\nFor information as to the amount of our rental obligations under leases on both Company-owned and franchised stores, see Note 10 “Leasing Arrangements” to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not aware of any pending legal actions that would, if determined adversely to us, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may, from time to time, become involved in disputes and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as a public company, we are also potentially\nsusceptible to litigation, such as asserting violations of\n24\nTable of Contents\nsecurities laws. Any such claims, with or without merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. There can be no assurance that an adverse result\nin any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “RMCF.”\nHolders\nOn May 31, 2024, there were approximately 442 record holders of our common stock. This figure does not include an estimate of the number of beneficial holders whose\nshares are held of record by banks, broker or other nominees.\nDividends\nAlthough we have previously paid cash dividends on our common stock, we have no present intention of paying a cash dividend on our common stock. Any determination to\npay dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of\noperations, projections, liquidity, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our existing and any future debt and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nUnregistered sales of equity securities\nIn connection with the appointment of Scott Ouellet as Senior Vice President, Manufacturing and Supply Chain, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\napproved an inducement award, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), to Mr. Ouellet, granted on September 18, 2023, consisting of an aggregate of 19,591\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs”). The RSUs were granted as an inducement material to Mr. Ouellet’s acceptance of employment as Senior Vice President, Manufacturing and\nSupply Chain, and were granted outside of the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated).\nThe issuance of the above securities was deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by\nan issuer not involving any public offering.\nITEM 6. RESERVED\n26\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (this “MD&A”) is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial\ncondition and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The following\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from\nthose anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A. “Risk\nFactors.”\nOverview\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (including its operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate\nFactory, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“RMCF”) (referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an international franchisor, confectionery producer and retail operator.\nFounded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado and produce an extensive line of premium chocolate products and other confectionery products (“Durango\nProducts”). Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/licensed system of retail stores that feature chocolate and other confectionary products\nincluding gourmet caramel apples. We also sell our confectionary products in select locations outside of our system of retail stores and license the use of our brand with certain\nconsumer products. As of February 29, 2024, there was 2 Company-owned, 115 licensee-owned and 152 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores operating in 36\nstates and the Philippines.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 10, 2023, our board of directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executive officers. Under the guidelines, non-employee\ndirectors are required to own certain eligible securities (“Eligible Shares”) of the Company worth three (3) times the cash portion of their annual directors’ base fees paid in\ncash, not including any retainers for service as the Board Chair or as a Board Committee Chair. Our Chief Executive Officer is required to own Eligible Shares worth three (3)\ntimes their base salary. Other executive officers of the Company are required to own Eligible Shares worth one (1) times their base salary. Non-employee directors elected prior\nto November 16, 2021 will have five (5) years from November 16, 2021 to meet the holding requirements. Non-employee directors elected after November 16, 2021 and up to\nNovember 10, 2023, will have five (5) years from the date of his or her election to meet the holding requirements. Executive officers serving as of November 10, 2023 will have\nfive (5) years from that date to meet the minimum ownership requirement. All directors and executive officers who are elected or appointed after November 10, 2023 will have\nfive (5) years from the time they are elected or appointed to meet the minimum ownership requirement.\nOn May 1, 2023, subsequent to the end of FY 2023, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary and frozen yogurt\nbusiness, U-Swirl International, Inc. The aggregate sale price of U-Swirl was $2.75 million, consisting of (i) $1.75 million in cash and (ii) $1.0 million evidenced by a three-\nyear secured promissory note. The business divestiture of the U-Swirl segment was preceded by a separate sale of the Company’s three owned U-Swirl locations on February\n24, 2023. The consolidated financial statements present the historical financial results of the former U-Swirl segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See\nNote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data“, of this Annual Report for information on this\ndivestiture.\nWith the sale of U-Swirl, we continue to focus on our confectionery business to further enhance our competitive position and operating margin, simplify our business model,\nand deliver sustainable value to our stockholders.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Business and Outlook\nAs a result of recent macroeconomic inflationary trends and disruptions to the global supply chain, we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing higher raw\nmaterial, labor, and freight costs. We have seen labor and logistics challenges, which we believe have contributed to lower factory, retail and e-commerce sales of our products\ndue to the availability of material, labor and freight. In addition, we could experience additional lost sale opportunities\n27\nTable of Contents\nif our products are not available for purchase as a result of continued disruptions in our supply chain relating to an inability to obtain ingredients or packaging, labor challenges\nat our logistics providers or our production facility, or if we or our franchisees experience delays in stocking our products.\nDuring FY 2023, the Company incurred substantial costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of\nstockholders. During FY 2023, the Company incurred approximately $4.1 million of costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies, however there were no such\ncomparable costs in FY 2024. The Company also incurred $1.2 million of severance and retirement related costs for certain of our executives in FY 2024, compared to $1.1\nmillion in FY 2023.\nWe are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales because of key holidays and the location of our franchisees, which have traditionally been located in resort or tourist locations,\nand the nature of the products we sell, which are highly seasonal. Historically, the strongest sales of our products have occurred during key holidays and summer vacation\nseasons. Additionally, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and sales of franchises. Because of the\nseasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in\nother quarters or for a full fiscal year.\nThe most important factors in continued growth in our earnings are our ability to increase the sales of premium chocolate products produced in our Durango production facility,\nthe ability to produce more efficiently, supporting our franchisees in increasing the frequency and average value of customer transactions, ongoing online revenue growth, and\nfranchise store growth.\nOur ability to successfully achieve expansion of our franchise systems depends on many factors not within our control including the availability of suitable sites for new store\nestablishment and the availability of qualified franchisees to support such expansion.\nEfforts to reverse the decline in same store pounds purchased from our production facility by franchised stores and to increase total Durango production depend on many\nfactors, including new store openings, competition, the receptivity of our franchise system to our product introductions and promotional programs.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nFiscal 2024 Compared To Fiscal 2023\nResults Summary\nBasic loss per share decreased from a loss from continuing operations of $(0.88) per share in FY 2023 to a loss from continuing operations of $(0.77) per share in FY 2024.\nRevenues decreased by 8.2% from $30.4 million for FY 2023 to $28.0 million for FY 2024. Operating loss was $4.9 million in FY 2023 compared to an operating loss of $4.9\nmillion in FY 2024. Loss from continuing operations decreased from a loss of $5.5 million in FY 2023 to a loss of $4.9 million in FY 2024.\nREVENUES\nFor the Year Ended\nFebruary 29 or 28, $ %\n($'s in thousands) 2024 2023\nChange Change\nDurango product and retail sales $ 22,022.3 $ 24,456.9 (2,434.6) (10.0)%\nFranchise fees 167.8 204.7 (36.9) (18.0)%\nRoyalty and marketing fees 5,760.6 5,770.8 (10.2) (0.2)%\nTotal $ 27,950.7 $ 30,432.4 $ (2,481.7) (8.2)%\nDurango Product and Retail Sales\nThe decrease in total sales for FY 2024 compared to FY 2023 was primarily due to a 10%, or $2.4 million, decrease in sales of product to our network of franchised and licensed\nretail stores resulting from disruptions in our consumer\n28\nTable of Contents\npackaged product availability to our franchise system due to a relocation of our packaging line to Salt Lake City, Utah in October as part of our plan to address labor shortages\nin the Durango area\nIn FY 2024, same store pounds purchased by franchisees and licensees declined slightly compared to the prior fiscal year. We continue to add new products and focus our\nexisting product lines in an effort to increase same store pounds purchased by existing locations.\nRoyalties, Marketing Fees and Franchise Fees\nRoyalty and marketing fees were approximately unchanged during FY 2024 compared to FY 2023. The slight decrease in franchise fee revenue during FY 2024 compared to FY\n2023 was primarily the result of store closures offset by the acceleration of unrecognized franchise fee revenue.\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES\nCost of Sales\nFor the Year Ended\nFebruary 29 or 28, $ %\n($'s in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change\nTotal cost of sales $ 20,655.6 $ 20,455.4 $ 200.2 1.0%\nFranchise costs\n2,582.4 1,825.8 756.6 41.4%\nSales and marketing 2,131.7 2,060.2 71.5 3.5%\nGeneral and administrative 6,673.9 10,325.7 (3,651.8) (35.4)%\nRetail operating 671.5 537.5 134.0 24.9%\nTotal $ 32,715.1 $ 35,204.6 $ (2,489.5) (7.1)%\nGross Margin For the Year Ended\nFebruary 29 or 28, $ %\n($'s in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change\nTotal gross margin $ 1,366.7 $ 4,001.5 $ (2,634.8) (65.8)%\nGross margin percentage 6.2% 16.4% (10.2)% (62.1)%\nAdjusted Gross Margin For the Year Ended\n(a non-GAAP measure) February 29 or 28, $ %\n($'s in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change\nTotal gross margin $ 1,366.7 $ 4,001.5 $ (2,634.8) (65.8)%\nPlus: depreciation and amortization 749.6 646.4 $ 103.2 16.0%\nTotal Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP measure) $ 2,116.3 $ 4,647.9 $ (2,531.6) (54.5)%\nTotal Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP measure) 9.6% 19.0% (9.4)% (49.4)%\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental\nmeasures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted gross margin is equal\nto the sum of our total gross margin plus depreciation and amortization calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted gross margin is helpful in understanding our\npast performance as a supplement to gross margin, and other performance measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin is useful to\ninvestors because they provide a measure of operating performance and our ability to generate cash that is unaffected by non-cash accounting measures. Additionally, we use\nadjusted gross margin rather than gross margin to make incremental pricing decisions. Adjusted gross margin has limitations as analytical tools because they exclude the impact\nof depreciation and amortization expense and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for any measure reported under GAAP. Our use of capital assets makes\ndepreciation and amortization expense a necessary\n29\nTable of Contents\nelement of our costs and our ability to generate income. Due to these limitations, we use adjusted gross margin as measures of performance only in conjunction with GAAP\nmeasures of performance such as gross margin.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nTotal gross margin decreased to 6.2% in FY 2024 compared to a gross margin of 16.4% during FY 2023, due primarily to an increase in overhead costs, a sharp increase in the\ncost of cocoa as a raw material as well as other inflationary pressures we were unable to capture through price increases, and a reduction in production volume. Additionally,\nproduction volume decreased and expense incurred increased as a result of the Company undertaking actions to relocated its consumer packaging operations to Salt Lake City,\nUtah in response to limited labor ability in the Durango labor pool, which lead to delays in order fulfillment going into our busy holiday sales season.\nFranchise Costs\nThe increase in franchise costs in FY 2024 compared to FY 2023 was due primarily to investments in human capital and the ongoing brand update and store redesign expense.\nAs a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs increased to 43.6% in FY 2024 from 30.6% in FY 2023. This increase as a\npercentage of royalty, marketing and franchise fees is primarily a result of higher royalty fees partially offset by higher costs.\nSales and Marketing\nThe increase in sales and marketing costs during FY 2024 compared to FY 2023 was due primarily to an increase in equity compensation costs and contract labor associated\nwith the retirement of our former Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and an increase in advertising costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs during FY 2024, compared to FY 2023, was due primarily to costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of\nproxies in connection with our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. During FY 2024, the Company did not incur material costs associated with the contested solicitation of\nproxies, compared with $4.1 million of costs associated with a contested solicitation of proxies during FY 2023. The Company also incurred increased professional fees related\nto legal support for our Board of Directors and legal costs associated with compensation agreements for our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and\nlegal and professional costs associated with the search for, and appointment of, a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, due to a\nstockholder's contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company had become contingently liable for certain change in\ncontrol severance payments to our former Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing if a triggering termination was to occur. As a result of our former Senior Vice President\nof Sales and Marketing's retirement in September 2022, the Company incurred $1.1 million of associated severance costs. As a percentage of total revenues, general and\nadministrative expenses decreased to 23.9% during FY 2024, compared to 33.9% during FY 2023.\nRetail Operating Expenses\nRetail operating expenses increased 24.9% during FY 2024 compared to FY 2023. This increase is primarily the result of the Company's new Corpus Christi, TX location. In\nNovember 2022 we sold a Company-owned store located in Peoria, Illinois, to a franchisee. The result is that as of February 29, 2024, we operated two Company-owned\nlocations.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization, exclusive of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales was $0.1 million during FY 2024, relatively unchanged from $0.1 million\nduring FY 2023. Depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales increased 16.0% from $0.6 million during FY 2023 to $0.7 million during FY 2024. This increase was\nthe result of investment in production equipment.\nOther Income (Expense)\n30\nTable of Contents\nOther income was $26,400 during FY 2024, compared to other income of $16,500 during FY 2023. This represents interest income of $79,836 during FY 2024 compared to\n$26,921 during FY 2023, and interest expense of $53,397 during FY 2024 compared to $10,431 during FY 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring FY 2024, we did not incur any income tax expense on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $4.9 million compared to an income tax expense of $0.6\nmillion on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $4.9 million during FY 2023. The FY 2023 expense was the result of recording a full valuation allowance\non our deferred income tax assets. See Note 13 to the financial statements for a description of income taxes, deferred tax assets, and associated reserves.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of February 29, 2024, working capital was $1.5 million compared with $6.2 million as of February 28, 2023. The decrease in working capital was due primarily to a strategic\nreduction of inventory on hand commensurate with the current product assortments actively marketed by us and our franchisees, and continued capital investment in the\nDurango production facility. We have historically generated excess operating cash flow.\nCash and cash equivalent balances decreased from $4.7 million as of February 28, 2023 to $2.1 million as of February 29, 2024 primarily as a result of cash used by operating\nand investing activities. Our current ratio was 1.19 to 1.0 on February 29, 2024 compared to 2.24 to 1.0 on February 28, 2023. We monitor current and anticipated future levels\nof cash and cash equivalents in relation to anticipated operating, financing and investing requirements.\nDuring FY 2024, we had a consolidated net loss of $4.2 million, less net loss from discontinued operations of $0.7 million. Operating activities used cash of $2.4 million, with\nthe principal adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities being depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million, provision for obsolete inventory\nof $0.2 million and stock compensation expense of $0.4 million. During FY 2023, we had a consolidated net loss of $5.7 million. Operating activities used cash of $2.1 million,\nwith the principal adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities being expense associated with establishing a full reserve of deferred tax assets\nof $0.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.8 million, provision for obsolete inventory of $0.7 million and stock compensation expense of $0.7 million.\nDuring FY 2024, investing activities used cash of $1.45 million, primarily due to the purchases of property and equipment of $3.0 million, partially offset by investing cash\nflow from discontinued operations (the result of the sale of U-Swirl assets) of $1.4 million. In comparison, investing activities used cash of $0.8 million during FY 2023\nprimarily due to the purchases of property and equipment of $1.0 million, partially offset by investing cash flow from discontinued operations of $0.2 million.\nThere were $1.25 million cash flows from financing activities during FY 2024 compared to no cash flows from financing activities during the prior year. The Company drew\ndown $1.25 million on its revolving line of credit during FY 2024 as discussed further below.\nThe conditions above raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial\nstatements. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s February 29, 2024, audited financial statements, raised substantial\ndoubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nRevolving Line of Credit\nPursuant to a credit agreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the “Lender”), we have a $4.0 million credit line for general corporate and\nworking capital purposes, of which $2.75 million was available for borrowing (subject to certain borrowing-based limitations) as of February 29, 2024 (the “Credit Line”). The\nCredit Line is secured by substantially all of our assets, except retail store assets. Interest on borrowings is at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2.37% (7.69% at\nFebruary 29, 2024 and 6.92% at February 28, 2023). Additionally, the Credit Line is subject to various financial ratio and leverage covenants. Per the Credit Agreement, the\nmaturity date is September 30, 2024.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAs of February 29, 2024 we were not in compliance with the requirement under the Credit Agreement to maintain a ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities of at\nleast 1.5 to 1. Our current ratio as of February 29, 2024 was 1.19 to 1. We have requested a waiver from the Lender and received approval as of the date of this Annual Report.\nWe were in compliance, however, with all other aspects of the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of our noncompliance, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lender has the option, but not the obligation, to immediately demand repayment of all funds\ndrawn down under the Credit Line. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have enough cash on hand to satisfy our obligations under the Credit Line if the Lender\nexercised its option to demand repayment. If the Lender exercises its option and demands repayment at some time in the future, however, we may not have sufficient funds\navailable to make the payments required. If we are unable to repay amounts owed, the Lender may be entitled to foreclose on and sell substantially all of our assets, which\nsecure our borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Lender retains the right to act on covenant violations that occur after the date of delivery of any waiver. If the Lender were to decline to grant us a waiver and\ninstead demand repayment in the future, we may need to seek alternative financing to pay these obligations as the Company may not have sufficient facilities or sufficient cash\non hand at that time to satisfy these obligations.\nThe Company is exploring various means of strengthening its liquidity position and ensuring compliance with its debt financing covenants, which may include the obtaining of\nwaivers from the Lender and/or amending our Credit Line facility. We are also exploring supplemental debt facilities for other operational activities which could give us the\nability to repay the Credit Line as needed.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents significant contractual obligations of the Company at February 29, 2024.\n(Amounts in thousands)\nMore\nLess than Than\nContractual Obligations Total 1 year 2-3 Years 4-5 years 5 years\nOperating leases $ 1,874,640 $ 514,169 $ 781,133 $ 238,208 $ 341,130\nPurchase contracts 269,808 269,808 - - -\nTotal $ 2,144,448 $ 783,977 $ 781,133 $ 238,208 $ 341,130\nThe Company made an average of $1.7 million per year in capital expenditures during FY 2022 to FY 2024. For FY 2025 the Company anticipates making similar levels of\ncapital expenditures. The planned increase is the result of expected investment in an updated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) management system, and machinery and\nequipment to replace equipment that has reached the end of its useful life.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients and labor directly affect the Company's operations. Most of the Company's leases provide for cost-of-living\nadjustments and require it to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, the Company’s future lease cost for new facilities\nmay include potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased costs to its customers.\nDepreciation expense is based on the historical cost to the Company of its fixed assets, and is therefore potentially less than it would be if it were based on the current\nreplacement cost. While property and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at higher prices, it is expected that replacement will be a gradual\nprocess over many years.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n32\nTable of Contents\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the\ncarrying value of accounts and notes receivable from franchisees, inventories, the useful lives of fixed assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies\nand litigation. We base our estimates on analyses, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company did not identify any critical estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended February 29, 2024.\nITEM 7A.

(the “Company”) as of February 29, 2024, and the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedule\nlisted in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of February 29, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the\nCompany has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations in recent years and is dependent on debt financing to fund its operations, all of which raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans regarding these\nmatters are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. (a Colorado corporation), Aspen Leaf Yogurt, LLC (“ALY”), U-Swirl International, Inc. (dissolved in October 2023)\n(“U-Swirl”), and U-Swirl, Inc. (“SWRL”) (collectively, the “Company”, \"we\", “RMCF”).\nThe Company is an international franchisor, confectionery manufacturer and retail operator. Founded in 1981, the Company is headquartered in Durango, Colorado and\nmanufactures an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products (“Durango Products”). The Company also sells its candy in select locations\noutside of its system of retail stores.\nOn February 24, 2023 the Company entered into an agreement to sell its three Company-owned U-Swirl locations. Separately, on May 1, 2023, subsequent to the 2023 fiscal\nyear end, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its franchise rights and intangible assets related to U-Swirl and associated brands. As a result, the activities of the\nCompany’s U-Swirl subsidiary that have historically been reported in the U-Swirl segment have been reported as discontinued operations. See Note 17 – Discontinued\nOperations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's discontinued operations, including net sales, operating\nearnings and total assets by segment. The Company’s financial statements reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise noted.\nThe Company’s revenues are currently derived from three principal sources: sales to franchisees and others of chocolates and other confectionery products manufactured by\nthe Company; the collection of initial franchise fees and royalties from franchisees’ sales; sales at Company-owned stores of chocolates and other confectionery products\nincluding gourmet caramel apples; and marketing fees.\nThe Company does not have a material amount of financial assets or liabilities that are required under U.S. GAAP to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value. The\nCompany is not a party to any material derivative financial instruments. The Company does not have a material amount of non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities\nthat are required under U.S. GAAP to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has not elected to use the fair value measurement option, as permitted\nunder U.S. GAAP, for any assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement is not presently required. The Company believes the fair values of cash equivalents,\naccounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and line of credit approximate their carrying amounts due to their short duration.\nThe following table summarizes the number of stores operating under the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand at February 29, 2024:\nStores Stores\nOpen at Open at\n2/28/2023 Opened Closed Sold 2/29/2024\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\nCompany-owned stores 1 1 - - 2\nFranchise stores - Domestic stores\nand kiosks 153 5 (9) - 149\nInternational license stores 4 - (1) - 3\nCold Stone Creamery - co-branded 101 4 (1) - 104\nU-Swirl - co-branded 10 1 - - 11\nTotal 269 269\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. In accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern,\nthe Company’s management has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\n41\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncontinue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying financial statements were issued. During the year ended February 29, 2024, the Company\nincurred a net loss of $4.2 million and used cash in operating activities of $2.4 million. Additionally, the Company was not in compliance with the requirement under a credit\nagreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the “Lender”) to maintain a ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities of at least\n1.5 to 1. The Company's current ratio as of February 29, 2024 was 1.19 to 1. The Company requested and received a waiver from the Lender as of the date the financial\nstatements were available to be issued. The Credit Agreement is set to expire on September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern within one year of the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to continue to implement its business plan. The Company is exploring various means of\nstrengthening its liquidity position and ensuring compliance with its debt financing covenants, which may include the obtaining of waivers from the Lender and/or,\namending its Credit Line facility. The Company is also exploring supplemental debt facilities for other operational activities. During the next twelve months the Company\nintends to sell an unused parcel of land near its headquarters, cut overhead for manufacturing, and increase profits and gross margins through increasing chocolate price\nsales to its franchising system and Specialty Market customers. In addition, the Company intends to benefit from busy season of holiday product sales and add a CFO to its\nmanagement teams during the next twelve months. In the event the Company is unable to generate profits, positive cash flow, and implement its business plan, it may have\nto curtail its business further and no longer continue as a going concern.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, have been prepared in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the estimate of the reserve for\nuncollectible accounts, revenue recognition, reserve for inventory obsolescence, and inputs for assessing goodwill impairment. The Company bases its estimates on\nhistorical experience and also on assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The Company assesses these estimates on a regular basis; however, actual results\ncould materially differ from these estimates.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company continually monitors\nits positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. As of the balance sheet date, and periodically throughout the year, the Company\nhas maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits.\nAccounts and Notes Receivable\nAccounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business and are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Notes\nreceivable generally reflect the sale of assets. Accounts and notes receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected, using an estimate of current expected\ncredit losses to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable and determines the\nappropriate allowance for expected credit losses based on a combination of factors,\n42\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nincluding the aging of the receivables and historical collection trends. When the Company is aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation, the Company\nmay individually evaluate the related receivable to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. The Company uses specific criteria to determine uncollectible\nreceivables to be written off, including bankruptcy filings, the referral of customer accounts to outside parties for collection, and the length that accounts remain past due.\nAs of February 29, 2024, the Company had $2,183,685 of accounts receivable outstanding, inclusive of an allowance for credit losses of $331,902. As of February 29,\n2023, the Company had $2,055,694 of accounts receivable outstanding, inclusive of an allowance for credit losses of $666,315.\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company had total notes receivable of $1,184,677, of which $1,000,000 relates to the U-Swirl note. The U-Swirl note is a three-year secured\npromissory note in the aggregate original principal amount of $1,000,000. Payment is due May 1, 2026. The remaining balance of notes receivable includes $214,563 of\nnotes receivable outstanding and an allowance for credit losses of $29,886 associated with these notes, compared to $191,725 of notes receivable outstanding and an\nallowance for credit losses of $73,951 on February 28, 2023. The notes require monthly payments and bear interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 7.0%. The notes mature\nthrough December 2027 and all of the notes receivable are secured by the assets of the location. The Company may experience the failure of its wholesale customers,\nincluding its franchisees, to whom it extends credit to pay amounts owed to the Company on time, or at all.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is adjusted for obsolete, damaged and excess inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value\nbased on actual differences. The inventory value is determined through analysis of items held in inventory, and, if the recorded value is higher than the net realizable value,\nthe Company records an expense to reduce inventory to its actual net realizable value. The process by which the Company performs its analysis is conducted on an item by\nitem basis and takes into account, among other relevant factors, net realizable value, sales history and future sales potential. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out\nmethod.\nProperty and Equipment and Other Assets\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful life of the asset,\nwhich ranges from five to thirty-nine years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of\nthe improvements, whichever is shorter.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets through analysis of estimated fair value, including identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes indicate the\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on\ntemporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations. These differences\nwill result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Considerable judgment is\nrequired in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss or other carryforward prior to its\nexpiration, is more likely than not. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset related to historical U-Swirl losses and has determined that these losses are restricted due\nto a limitation on the deductibility of future losses in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of the foreclosure transaction. The Company's\ntemporary differences are listed in Note 13.\nGift Card Breakage\n43\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company and its franchisees sell gift cards that are redeemable for product in stores. The Company manages the gift card program, and therefore collects all funds from\nthe activation of gift cards and reimburses franchisees for the redemption of gift cards in their stores. A liability for unredeemed gift cards is included in current liabilities in\nour balance sheets.\nThere are no expiration dates on the Company’s gift cards, and the Company does not charge any service fees. While the Company’s franchisees continue to honor all gift\ncards presented for payment, the Company may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. The Company\nrecognizes breakage from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the Company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the\ncustomer is remote (“gift card breakage”). The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns. Accrued gift card\nliability was $624,335 and $592,932 at February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023, respectively. The Company recognized breakage of $40,218 and $59,754 during FY 2024\nand FY 2023, respectively.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose primarily from two transaction types. The first type was the purchase of various retail stores, either individually or as a group, for which the purchase price\nwas in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired. The second type was from business acquisitions, where the fair value of the consideration given for acquisition\nexceeded the fair value of the identified assets net of liabilities.\nThe Company performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, generally the first day of its fourth quarter, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated through a comparison of the fair value of\neach of the Company’s reporting units with its carrying value. To the extent that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an\nimpairment loss is recognized. The Company’s goodwill is further described in Note 7 to the financial statements.\nDuring FY 2023, the Company recorded $84,183 of impairment of goodwill associated with its retail segment, and included within general and administrative expense on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no similar impairment charges during FY 2024 or FY 2022.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets represent non-physical assets that create future economic value and are primarily composed of packaging design, store design, trademarks and non-\ncompetition agreements. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from 5 years to 20 years based on the expected future economic value\nof the intangible asset. Intangible assets are recorded at their cost. The Company performs intangible asset impairment testing on an annual basis or more frequently when\nevents or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company’s intangible assets are further described\nin Note 7 to the financial statements.\nInsurance and Self-Insurance Reserves\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property\ninsurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company\nare estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other assumptions. While the Company believes that its\nassumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and\nhistorical trends.\nSales\n44\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company has performance obligations to sell products to franchisees and other customers, and revenue is recognized at a point in time. Control is transferred when the\norder has been shipped to a customer, utilizing a third party, or at the time of delivery when shipped on the Company’s trucks. Revenue is measured based on the amount of\nconsideration that is expected to be received by the Company for providing goods or services under a contract with a customer. Sales of products to franchisees and other\ncustomers are made at standard prices, without any bargain sales of equipment or supplies. Sales of products at retail stores are recognized at the time of sale.\nRebates\nRebates received from purveyors that supply products to the Company’s franchisees are included in franchise royalties and fees. Product rebates are recognized in the period\nin which they are earned. Rebates related to Company-owned locations are offset against operating costs.\nShipping Fees\nShipping fees charged to customers by the Company’s trucking department are reported as sales. Shipping costs incurred by the Company for inventory are reported as cost\nof sales or inventory.\nFranchise and Royalty Fees\nThe Company recognizes franchise fees over the term of the associated franchise agreement, which is generally a period of 10 years. In addition to the initial franchise fee,\nthe Company also recognizes a marketing and promotion fee of one percent (1%) of franchised stores’ gross retail sales and a royalty fee based on gross retail sales. The\nCompany recognizes no royalty on franchised stores’ retail sales of products purchased from the Company’s manufacturing facility and recognizes a ten percent (10%)\nroyalty on all other sales of product made in store and sold at franchise locations.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn FY 2021, stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2007 Plan”). The 2007 Plan allows\nawards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock and stock units, performance shares and performance units, and other stock- or cash-based\nawards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense over the\nrequisite service period.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally five to six years.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nRelated Party Transactions\n45\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn December 14, 2022 the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”), by and among the Company, Bradley L. Radoff, an\nindividual (“Radoff”), Andrew T.

ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other\ninstruments. ASU 2016-13 will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets, which will\ngenerally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments and affect the carrying value of accounts receivable. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2016-13 effective March 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”).

The disclosures required under ASU 2023-\n07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The updates in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on\nits consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid.

Certain leases contain renewal options for between\nfive and ten additional years at increased monthly rentals. Some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on sales in excess of predetermined base levels.\nThe Company acts as primary lessee of some franchised store premises, which the Company then subleases to franchisees, but the majority of existing franchised locations are\nleased by the franchisee directly.\nIn some instances, the Company has leased space for its Company-owned locations that are now occupied by franchisees. When the Company-owned location was sold or\ntransferred, the store was subleased to the franchisee who is responsible for the monthly rent and other obligations under the lease.\nThe Company also leases trucking equipment and warehouse space in support of its production operations. Expense associated with trucking and warehouse leases is included\nin cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company accounts for payments related to lease liabilities on a straight-line basis over the lease term. During the years ended February 29 or 28, 2024 and 2023, lease\nexpense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations was $599,853 and $565,046, respectively.\nThe lease liability reflects the present value of the Company’s estimated future minimum lease payments over the life of its leases. This includes known escalations and\nrenewal option periods reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the sales performance of the\nlocation remains strong. Therefore, the right of use asset and lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company and\nare not currently a future obligation. The Company has separated non-lease components from lease components in the recognition of the Asset and Liability except in\ninstances where such costs were not practical to separate. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is\nimmaterial. For franchised locations, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees\nas part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-store related leases such as storage facilities and trucking equipment. For leases where\nthe implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the\nCompany would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease.

These contracts permit the Company to purchase the\nspecified commodity at a fixed price on an as-needed basis during the term of the contract. Because prices for these products may fluctuate, the Company may benefit if prices\nrise during the terms of these contracts, but it may be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall and it is unable to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As of February\n29, 2024, the Company was contracted for approximately $270,000 of raw materials under such agreements. The Company has designated these contracts as normal under the\nnormal purchase and sale exception under the accounting standards for derivatives. These contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations. The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it\nbelieves it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At February 29, 2024, the Company was not a party to any legal proceedings\nthat were expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.\nNOTE 12 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nRedemption of Preferred Stock Purchase Rights\n55\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn October 2, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the redemption of all the outstanding preferred stock purchase rights (the “Rights”) granted pursuant to the Rights\nAgreement, dated March 1, 2015, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (as amended, the “Rights Agreement”), commonly\nreferred to as a “poison pill.” Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors to approve the redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights terminated, which\neffectively terminated the Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Rights were redeemed at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right. As a result, the Company\npaid an aggregate amount of $61,276 to stockholders in October 2021 to redeem the Rights.\nWarrants\nIn connection with a terminated supplier agreement with a former customer of the Company, the Company issued a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase up to 960,677 shares\nof the Company’s common stock (the “Warrant Shares”) at an exercise price of $8.76 per share. The Warrant Shares were to vest in annual tranches in varying amounts\nfollowing each contract year under the terminated supplier agreement, and was subject to, and only upon, achievement of certain revenue thresholds on an annual or\ncumulative five-year basis in connection with its performance under the terminated supplier agreement. The Warrant was to expire six months after the final and conclusive\ndetermination of revenue thresholds for the fifth contract year and the cumulative revenue determination in accordance with the terms of the Warrant.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company sent a formal notice to the customer terminating the agreement. As of February 29, 2024, no Warrant Shares had vested and, subsequent\nto the termination by the Company of supplier agreement, the Company has no remaining material obligations under the Warrant.\nThe Company determined that the grant date fair value of the Warrant was de minimis and did not record any amount in consideration of the warrants. The Company utilized a\nMonte Carlo model for purposes of determining the grant date fair value.\nNOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following for the years ended February 29 or 28:\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrent\nFederal $ - $ (116,792) $ 204,058\nState - 8,472 46,704\nTotal Current - (108,320) 250,762\nDeferred\nFederal - 621,841 (231,430)\nState - 100,322 (36,144)\nTotal Deferred - 722,163 (267,574)\nTotal $ - $ 613,843 $ (16,812)\n56\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC.

This was primarily the result of losses reported in the year, no income taxes due, and full valuation allowance\nagainst deferred tax assets.\nDuring FY 2023 the Company’s effective tax rate resulted in recognition of income tax expense despite incurring a pretax loss. During FY 2023 income tax expense was\nprimarily the result of expense associated with an increase in reserves for deferred tax assets. Management evaluated recent losses before income taxes and determined that it\nis no longer more likely than not that our deferred income taxes are fully realizable. Because of this determination, the Company reserved for approximately $1.6 million of\ndeferred tax assets. As of February 28, 2023, the Company has a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\nDuring FY 2022 the low effective income tax rate was primarily the result of permanent differences between the Company’s expenses as valued for financial reporting\npurposes versus for income tax purposes. These differences were primarily valuation of restricted stock units and the period of recognition for employee retention credits.\nDuring FY 2021 the Company’s effective tax rate resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit as a result of a pretax loss being recognized for the year.\nThe components of deferred income taxes as of February 29 or 28 are as follows:\n2024 2023\nDeferred Tax Assets\nAllowance for doubtful accounts and notes $ 169,615 $ 182,031\nInventories 30,849 100,725\nAccrued compensation 437,972 158,652\nLoss provisions and deferred income 303,600 340,652\nSelf-insurance accrual 27,893 24,098\nInterest & other 17,239 —\nRestructuring charges 99,069 98,693\nRight of use liabilities 479,732 —\nAccumulated net losses 3,576,640 1,669,288\nValuation allowance (3,106,393) (1,721,306)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 2,036,216 $ 852,833\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nDepreciation and amortization ) )\n(1,450,441 (771,593\nRight of use assets (479,609) —\nPrepaid expenses (106,166) (81,240)\nDeferred Tax Liabilities (2,036,216) (852,833)\nNet deferred tax assets $ - $ -\n57\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and\nstate tax examinations in its major tax jurisdictions for periods before FY 2019.\nRealization of the Company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income, in the appropriate tax jurisdictions, in future years, to\nobtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if\nestimates of future taxable income are changed. A valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is established when it is more likely than\nnot that we will not realize some portion or all of the tax benefit of our deferred income tax assets. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, whether it is more likely than\nnot that our deferred income tax assets are realizable based upon recent past financial performance, tax reporting positions, and expectations of future taxable income. The\ndetermination of deferred tax assets is subject to estimates and assumptions. The Company periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to determine if our assumptions and\nestimates should change. As of February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will\nbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The application of\nincome tax law is inherently complex. As such, the Company is required to make judgments regarding income tax exposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding\nincome tax law and regulations change over time and may result in changes to the Company's judgments which can materially affect amounts recognized in the balance sheets\nand statements of operations. The result of the assessment of the Company's tax positions did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements for the years ended\nFebruary 29 or 28, 2024 or 2023. The Company does not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits and does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in\nunrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Amounts are recognized for income tax related interest and penalties as a component of general and administrative\nexpense in the statement of income and are immaterial for the years ended February 29 or 28, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries, SWRL, along with U-Swirl had a history of net operating losses prior to the company’s acquisition of them and thus the Company has a related\nnet operating loss carry forward. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, deductibility of SWRL’s and U-Swirl’s Federal net operating loss carryovers\nmay be subject to annual limitation in the event of a change in control. The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation as to whether a change in control has taken\nplace, and has concluded that there was a change of control with respect to the net operating losses of U-Swirl when the Company acquired its controlling ownership interest.\nThe initial limitations will continue to limit deductibility of SWRL’s and U-Swirl’s net operating loss carryovers, but the annual loss limitation will be deductible to RMCF\nand U-Swirl International Inc. upon the filing of joint tax returns in FY 2017 and future years.\nThe Company estimates that the potential future tax deductions of U-Swirl’s Federal net operating losses, limited by section 382, to be approximately $1,811,000 with a\nresulting deferred tax asset of approximately $445,000. U-Swirl’s Federal net operating loss carryovers will expire at various dates beginning in 2026.\nIncome tax provision (benefit) allocated to continuing operations and discontinued operations for the years ended February 29 or 28, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n58\nTable of Contents\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC.

Franchising, Manufacturing, Retail Stores, and\nUnallocated, which is the basis upon which the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the chief executive officer, evaluates the Company’s performance. The accounting\npolicies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements. The Company\nevaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating contribution, which excludes unallocated corporate general and administrative costs and income tax expense\nor benefit. The Company’s reportable segments are strategic businesses that utilize common merchandising, distribution, and marketing functions, as well as common\ninformation systems and corporate administration. All inter-segment sales prices are market based.

These severance payments and the Company’s share of associated payroll taxes in the amount of approximately $660,000 will occur\nover a 15-month period. The Company accrued a total of approximately $692,000 for all cash payments to be made to the CEO pursuant to the separation agreement.\nIn addition, all unvested RSU awards and stock options were cancelled upon effectiveness of the separation agreement.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures — The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), that\nare designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify the Company’s financial reports and to other members of\nsenior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s\nreports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the\nCompany files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation (pursuant to\nRule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act), as of February 29, 2024, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of February 29, 2024.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting — Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under\nsupervision of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\npreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management, with the\nparticipation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness, as of February 29, 2024, of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In\nmaking this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its publication Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 29,\n2024.\nUnder the applicable SEC rules, we are not required to include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm, CohnReznick LLP, on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting — During the year ended February 28, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls resulting from\nour finance department not being able to process and account for complex, non-routine transactions in accordance with GAAP. During the year ended February 29, 2024, we\nretained the assistance of several accounting experts to assist us in the accounting and reporting of complex, non-routine transactions and ensure correct accounting under US\nGAAP. As of February 29, 2024, management determined that the enhancements to the controls noted above have been in place for a sufficient period of time and has\nconcluded, through testing, that the material weakness identified in the prior year has been remediated.\nExcept as noted above, our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, confirm that there were no other changes in our company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of Delaware and has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which is our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Common Stock”). The rights of stockholders of\nthe Company are generally governed by Delaware law and the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and Third\nAmended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”). The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. This summary is not\ncomplete and is qualified by reference to the full texts of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), as well as applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”).\nGeneral\nThe authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 46,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and 250,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share\n(“Preferred Stock”).\nCommon Stock\nThe holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the common stockholders, including the election of directors.\nExcept as provided by the terms of any outstanding Preferred Stock, our common stockholders will possess exclusive voting power. The holders of Common Stock are not\nentitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of directors at a duly called meeting at which a\nquorum is present. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve all other matters\nwhich may properly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.\nSubject to preferences of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends our Board of\nDirectors (“Board of Directors”) may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. If the Company is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of\nCommon Stock are entitled to share pro rata in all assets remaining after payment of, or provision for, the Company’s liabilities and liquidation preferences of any outstanding\nshares of Preferred Stock. Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, sinking fund or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and\nprivileges of holders of our Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock which we may\ndesignate and issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Board of Directors has the authority, subject to limitations prescribed by law, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 250,000 shares of\nPreferred Stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the number of shares to be included in each such series. The Board of Directors also has the authority to\nfix the designations, voting powers, preferences, privileges, rights and limitations of any series of Preferred Stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights,\nterms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the Common Stock. The Board of Directors, without stockholder\napproval, can issue Preferred Stock with voting, conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of Common Stock. The\nissuance of Preferred Stock may decrease the market price of the Company’s Common Stock.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Board of Directors is not classified and each of our directors is elected annually. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors may be\nfixed only by the resolution of the Board of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock, any vacancy in the Board of Directors (including a\nvacancy caused by an increase in the number of directors) may be filled solely by resolution adopted by a majority of our directors then in office, whether or not such majority\nconstitutes less than a quorum, or by a single remaining director. Subject to the rights of holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock to elect directors or to remove directors so\nelected, a director may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the\nelection of directors, voting as a single class.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nSubject to the rights of holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders may be called only (a) pursuant to a resolution approved by a\nmajority of the Board of Directors, (b) by the chair of the Board of Directors, or (c) by holders of at least 25% of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, provided that such\nholders have continuously held at least 25% of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting for a period of two years prior to such special meeting.\nNo Stockholder Action by Written Consent\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholders may not take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\nExcept as provided in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act and under the “Proxy Access” heading below, a stockholder who intends to propose business or nominate\ncandidates for election as directors at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company must comply with the notice, informational requirements and procedures\nset forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

The Bylaws may\ngenerally be amended by the Board of Directors or by stockholders upon approval of holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all of the Company’s then-outstanding\nvoting stock, voting together as a single class.\nLimitations on Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any\nbusiness combination with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date that a stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n• prior to that date, the Board of Directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested\nstockholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the\nvoting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting\nstock owned by the interested stockholder) (a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and (b) shares owned by employee stock plans in which\nemployee participants do not have the right\nto determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n• on or following that date the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the\naffirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe term “interested stockholder” is defined generally as any person who is the owner of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock or any person\nwho is an affiliate or associate of the Company and was the owner of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period\nimmediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested stockholder, and the affiliates and associates of such person.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions\nCertain provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws summarized above may have an anti-takeover effect and could make the following\ntransactions more difficult: acquisition of the Company by means of a tender offer; acquisition of the Company by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or removal of the\nCompany’s incumbent officers and directors. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may\notherwise consider to be in their best interest or in the best interests of the Company, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our\nCommon Stock.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent for the Common Stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Compensation\nCommittee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n3.Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n(a)“Accounting Restatement” shall mean an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting\nrestatement (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (i.e., a\n“Big R” restatement), or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in\nthe current period (i.e., a “little r” restatement).\n(b)“Affiliate” shall mean each entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the\nCompany.\n(c)“Applicable Exchange” shall mean (i) The Nasdaq Stock Market, if the Company’s securities are listed on such national stock\nexchange, or (ii) the New York Stock Exchange, if the Company’s securities are listed on such national stock exchange.\n(d)“Applicable Listing Standards” shall mean (i) Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608, if the Company’s securities are listed on The Nasdaq\nStock Market, or (ii) Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, if the Company’s securities are listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange.\n(e)“Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation” shall mean Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Executive (i) on\nor after the Effective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if such individual served as a Covered Executive at any\ntime during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation (irrespective of whether such individual continued to serve as a\nCovered Executive upon or following the Restatement Trigger Date), (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association, and (v) during the applicable Clawback Period.

Upon the occurrence of a Restatement Trigger Date, the Company shall recoup\nErroneously Awarded Compensation reasonably promptly, in the manner described below. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s\nobligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when restated financial statements are\nfiled following the Restatement Trigger Date.\n(a)Process. The Compensation Committee shall use the following process for recoupment:\n(i)First, the Compensation Committee will determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each\nCovered Executive in connection with such Accounting Restatement. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock\nprice or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly\nfrom the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the Compensation Committee based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based\nCompensation was Received (in which case, the Company shall maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and\nprovide such documentation to the Applicable Exchange).\n(ii)Second, the Compensation Committee will provide each affected Covered Executive with a written notice stating the\namount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, a demand for recoupment, and the means of recoupment that the Company will accept.\n(b)Means of Recoupment. The Compensation Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recoupment of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include without limitation: (i) recoupment of cash or shares of Company stock, (ii) forfeiture\nof unvested cash or equity awards (including those subject to service-based and/or performance-based vesting conditions), (iii) cancellation of\noutstanding vested cash or equity awards (including those for which service-based and/or performance-based vesting conditions have been\nsatisfied), (iv) to the extent consistent with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 409A”), offset of other\namounts owed to the Covered Executive or forfeiture of deferred compensation, (v) reduction of future compensation, and (vi) any other\nremedial or recovery action permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Group makes no guarantee as to the treatment of\nsuch amounts under Section 409A and shall have no liability with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, appropriate means of recoupment\nmay include amounts approved, awarded, or granted prior to the Effective Date. Except as set forth in Section 4(d) below, in no event may the\nCompany Group accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Executive’s\nobligations hereunder.\n(c)Failure to Repay. To the extent that a Covered Executive fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company\nGroup when due (as determined in\n-3-\naccordance with Section 4(a) above), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company Group to, take all actions\nreasonable and appropriate to recoup such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Executive. The applicable\nCovered Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company Group for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by\nthe Company Group in recouping such Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n(d)Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to recoup Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation if one of the following conditions is met and the Compensation Committee determines that recoupment would be impracticable:\n(i)The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Executive would exceed the\namount to be recouped, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recoup the applicable Erroneously Awarded Compensation,\ndocumented such attempts, and provided such documentation to the Applicable Exchange;\n(ii)Recoupment would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that,\nbefore determining that it would be impracticable to recoup any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home\ncountry law, the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Applicable Exchange, that recoupment would\nresult in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the Applicable Exchange; or\n(iii)Recoupment would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available\nto employees, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n5.Reporting and Disclosure. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the\nDodd-Frank Rules.\n6.Indemnification Prohibition. No member of the Company Group shall be permitted to indemnify any current or former Covered Executive\nagainst (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is recouped pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating\nto the Company Group’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. The Company may not pay or reimburse any Covered Executive for the\ncost of third-party insurance purchased by a Covered Executive to fund potential recoupment obligations under this Policy.\n7.Acknowledgment. To the extent required by the Compensation Committee, each Covered Executive shall be required to sign and return to\nthe Company the acknowledgement form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Covered Executive will agree to be bound by the\nterms of, and comply with, this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, each Covered Executive will be fully bound by, and must comply with, the\nPolicy, whether or not such Covered Executive has executed and returned such acknowledgment form to the Company.\n8.Interpretation. The Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. The Compensation Committee intends that this Policy be interpreted consistent\nwith the Dodd-Frank Rules.\n-4-\n9.Amendment; Termination. The Compensation Committee may amend or terminate this Policy from time to time in its discretion, including\nas and when it determines that it is legally required to do so by any federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities\nexchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n10.Other Recoupment Rights. The Compensation Committee intends that this Policy be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The\nCompensation Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award, cash incentive award, or any other agreement entered\ninto be conditioned upon the Covered Executive’s agreement to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is\nin addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company Group, whether arising\nunder applicable law, regulation or rule, pursuant to the terms of any other policy of the Company Group, pursuant to any employment\nagreement, equity award, cash incentive award, or other agreement applicable to a Covered Executive, or otherwise (the “Separate Clawback\nRights”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no duplication of recovery of the same Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this\nPolicy and the Separate Clawback Rights, unless required by applicable law.\n11.Successors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\nadministrators or other legal representatives.\n-5-\nExhibit A\nROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC.\nCLAWBACK POLICY\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of the Rocky Mountain\nChocolate Factory, Inc.
