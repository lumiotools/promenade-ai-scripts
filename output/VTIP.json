          "content": "Economics and markets\n\n# Labor market pulse: Firms hiring at lower rates\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \n\nLarge employers are proceeding with caution in hiring new workers. In addition, hiring activity for lower-income jobs continues to normalize from the highs of the pandemic recovery. Vanguard expects that labor productivity will remain strong in 2025, lowering the risk of job cuts, and that the rate at which firms hire new workers will likely hold at its current modest level.\n\nHiring continues to slow\n\nVanguard’s proprietary data on enrollments in 401(k) retirement plans indicate a slowdown in the hires rate, which measures new hires as a share of existing employees. “For firms with over 250 employees, the hires rate has been trending lower, dropping to 1.6% in October from 2.1% in April,” said Vanguard investment analyst David Pakula.\n\nSimilarly, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and adjusted to focus on firms with over 250 employees, reveals a comparable slowdown in hiring over the past year. The JOLTS rate decreased from 3.2% in January to 2.9% in September.\n\n“A decrease in hiring usually accompanies a broader decline in the labor market, but we’re not really seeing that this time around,” said Vanguard senior economist Adam Schickling. “That’s likely because firms are still seeing decent worker productivity and don’t feel concerned about being overstaffed.”\n\nSchickling added that “a challenging labor supply environment in 2025 means that only modest job growth will be needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, effectively keeping the unemployment rate in the low 4% range.”\n\nPost-COVID hiring trends appear to be returning to normalcy. With employee turnover stabilizing, firms are able to hire at lower rates, likely because of reduced attrition.\n\nVanguard data through October indicate that the hiring pace is decelerating \n\n**Notes:** The Vanguard hires rate is calculated at the firm level and is based on new enrollments in 401(k) retirement plans administered by Vanguard divided by the number of all active 401(k) plan participants in a given month. New hires are recorded based on their hire date rather than their retirement plan enrollment date. The series is seasonally adjusted using the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method and transformed into a three-month moving average. The dataset represents a rolling two-year sample of firms with greater than 250 employees across all sectors of the economy that offer retirement plans that Vanguard has administered since January 2003. Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data are based on a nationally representative survey of 21,000 nonfarm business and government establishments. JOLTS is adjusted to capture firms with greater than 250 employees. The two vertical bars indicate economic recessions, as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research. JOLTS data are as of September 2024, and Vanguard data are as of October 2024.\n\n**Sources:** U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Vanguard.\n\nHiring for lower-income jobs weakens\n\nVanguard data indicate that the hires rate that has been robust for lower-income jobs—those with annual pay below $57,000—edged lower, to 1.2%, in October from a recent high of 1.4% in June. “This slowdown stands in contrast to hiring for middle- and high-income jobs, which has remained steady at around 0.6% to 0.7%, respectively, for more than a year,” said Pakula.\n\n“Hiring activity for lower-income jobs continues to normalize following the pandemic recovery,” Schickling explained. “While it remains above the rates for higher-income workers, the recent decline reflects more modest hiring in sectors like retail trade and leisure and hospitality.”\n\nThe hires rate for low-income jobs continues to normalize postpandemic \n\n**Notes:** The hires rate by income percentile refers to new hires as a share of existing employees. The Vanguard hires rate is calculated at the firm level and is based on new enrollments in 401(k) retirement plans administered by Vanguard divided by the number of all active 401(k) plan participants in a given month. The hires rate series is seasonally adjusted using the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method and transformed into a three-month moving average. Income is inferred from data on participants’ 401(k) plan savings-rate elections and realized contributions. Data are reported on a lag because of data coverage limitations.\n\n**Source:** Vanguard, as of August 2024.\n\nAbout Vanguard hires data\n\nTotal hires and hires by income have several methodological differences due to data limitations when pairing firm hires rates with worker attributes. The total hires chart ends in October 2024 and contains a rolling sample of 1,453 firms for which Vanguard provided 401(k) plan recordkeeping services for the prior 24 months. We also use the X-13ARIMA-SEATS adjustment to remove seasonal patterns in the data. The income-based chart plots data through August 2024 and is based on a monthly cross-section of 401(k) clients because of data availability constraints. The income cut reflects a monthly sample of 1,749 firms. For both charts, we calculated a three-month moving average in addition to the X-13ARIMA-SEATS adjustment to smooth the data given sample-size limitations. These methodological differences may lead to differences in trends between the aggregate hires chart and the income-based chart.\n\nVanguard hires data do not capture the whole U.S. economy, since roughly only half of earners—a group disproportionately composed of higher-income earners—have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans. Moreover, employers that offer 401(k) plans tend to be larger, more mature, and concentrated in certain industries.\n\n##### Related links:\n\n  * [Navigating the post-election environment](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/navigating-the-us-election.html) (article, issued November 2024)\n  * [3 tips to enhance retirement success: How America Saves](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/3-tips-enhance-retirement-success-how-america-saves.html) (article, issued October 2024)\n  * [Investor Pulse: Steady sentiments defy market waves](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/investor-pulse-steady-sentiments-defy-market-waves.html) (article, issued September 2024)\n  * [Out of sight, out of market: The IRA cash drag](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/out-sight-out-market-ira-cash-drag.html) (article, issued September 2024)\n\n\n\n**Note:**_CFA®_ and _Chartered Financial Analyst®_ are registered trademarks owned by CFA Institute.\n\nContributors\n\n![Fiona Greig, Ph.D.](/content/dam/corp/articles/images/fiona_greig_contributor.jpg) [Fiona Greig, Ph.D.](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/what-we-think/bios.html?drawer=1#tabs-16582f12f6-item-235d4f41b6-tab) Vanguard Global Head of Investor Research and Policy\n\n![Kelly Hahn](/content/dam/corp/articles/images/kelly_hahn_contributor.jpg) [Kelly Hahn](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/what-we-think/bios.html?drawer=2#tabs-16582f12f6-item-235d4f41b6-tab) Vanguard Head of Retirement Research\n\n![Adam Schickling, CFA](/content/dam/corp/articles/images/adam_schickling_contributor.jpg)\n\nAdam Schickling, CFA\n\nVanguard U.S. Senior Economist\n\n![David Pakula, CFA](/content/dam/corp/articles/images/david_pakula_contributor.jpg)\n\nDavid Pakula, CFA\n\nVanguard Investment Analyst\n\nVanguard Information and Insights\n\nSubscribe to Vanguard. \n\nGet Vanguard news, insights, and timely analysis on the market, delivered straight to your inbox. \n\nSubscribe\n\nRead our [online privacy notice](https://investor.vanguard.com/privacy-center/online-privacy-notice) to learn about how we keep personal information private. \n\n![Vanguard logo](/etc.clientlibs/corporatesite/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/icons/vanguardLogos/VanguardLogo.svg)\n\nVanguard is the trusted name in investing.

outlook summary highlights the top-level findings of Vanguard’s full economic and market outlook, _Beyond the Landing_ , to be distributed in mid-December.\n\nGlobal inflation has slowed sharply in the last two years and is now within touching distance of 2%. But the path to disinflation has been uneven across countries and regions, with most developed markets enduring monetary-policy-induced slowdowns to get there. The United States is a notable exception, having experienced accelerating economic growth and full employment with no discernible effect from restrictive monetary policy.\n\nHas the U.S. achieved a soft landing? Or will the impact of high interest rates eventually lead to a hard landing? These questions have dominated the market narrative over the last two years, with the focus on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve can perfectly time the rate-cutting cycle to achieve painless disinflation.\n\nYet this emphasis on the “landing” may not fully explain the pairing of exceptionally strong growth and falling inflation that we’ve witnessed in the U.S. The forces that do explain it suggest a new narrative for the economy and markets.\n\nIn our 2025 outlook, we adopt a framework centered on the supply-side forces that have shaped the U.S. economy. These include a surge in both labor productivity and available labor. Supply-side forces offer a more satisfying explanation for the positive growth and inflation dynamic. Emerging risks—such as those related to immigration policies, geopolitics, or potential tariffs—also fit more naturally into this supply-side-aware framework. \n\nVanguard’s 2025 economic forecasts\n\n**Notes:** Forecasts are as of November 12, 2024. For the U.S., GDP growth is defined as the year-over-year change in fourth-quarter GDP. For all other countries/regions, GDP growth is defined as the annual change in GDP in the forecast year compared with the previous year. Unemployment rate forecasts are the average for the fourth quarter of 2025. NAIRU is the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, a measure of labor market equilibrium. Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices. For the U.S., euro area, U.K., and Japan, core inflation is defined as the year-over-year change in the fourth quarter compared with the previous year. For China, core inflation is defined as the average annual change compared with the previous year. For the U.S., core inflation is based on the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index. For all other countries/regions, core inflation is based on the core Consumer Price Index. For U.S. monetary policy, Vanguard’s forecast refers to the top end of the Federal Open Market Committee’s target range. China’s policy rate is the seven-day reverse repo rate. The neutral rate is the equilibrium policy rate at which no easing or tightening pressures are being placed on an economy or its financial markets.\n\n**Source:** Vanguard.\n\nU.S. economic resilience not driven by Fed policy\n\nAgainst the backdrop of restrictive monetary policy, the U.S. economy has had the favorable combination of strong real GDP growth, loosening of overly tight labor markets, and falling inflation. It may be tempting to attribute this good fortune to a ”soft landing” engineered by the Fed. However, a closer look suggests that this interpretation may be insufficient.\n\nRather, continued U.S. robustness may owe more to fortuitous supply-side factors, including higher productivity growth and a surge in available labor. Higher output and lower inflation can generally coexist only when the supply-side forces are in the driver’s seat. These dynamics have altered our baseline U.S. economic outlook and point to the primary risks on the horizon.\n\nWhile these positive supply-side drivers of growth may continue in 2025, emerging policy risks such as the implementation of trade tariffs and stricter immigration policies may offset gains. Under such a scenario, U.S. real GDP growth would cool from its present rate of around 3% to closer to 2%. These offsetting policy risks may also increase inflationary pressures. Therefore, we anticipate that core inflation will remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. Although we expect the Fed to reduce its policy rate to 4%, cuts beyond that would prove difficult as any weakening of growth would have to be weighed against a potential inflation revival.\n\nEconomies outside of the United States have been less lucky on the supply side, and thus unable to achieve the same combination of strong growth alongside significantly reduced inflation. While inflation is now close to target in the euro area, that has come at the price of stagnation in 2023 and 2024, with muted external demand, weak productivity, and the lingering effects of the energy crisis holding activity back. Growth is expected to remain below trend next year, as a slowdown in global trade represents a key risk. Expect the European Central Bank to cut rates below neutral, to 1.75%, by the end of 2025.\n\nIn China, policymakers still have work to do despite their coordinated policy pivot in late 2024. Growth should pick up in the coming quarters as financing conditions ease and fiscal stimulus measures kick in. But more decisive and aggressive measures are needed to overcome intensifying external headwinds, structural issues in the property sector, and weak confidence in both the household and business sectors. We maintain our weaker-than-consensus secular view on Chinese growth, and thus expect additional monetary and fiscal loosening in 2025.\n\nEra of sound money lives on, with a new point of tension emerging\n\nAlthough central banks are now easing monetary policy, we maintain our view that policy rates will settle at higher levels than in the 2010s. This environment sets the foundation for solid cash and fixed income returns over the next decade, but the equity view is more cautious. This structural theme holds even in a scenario where central banks briefly cut rates below neutral to allay temporary growth wobbles. The era of sound money—characterized by positive real interest rates—lives on.\n\nThe investment challenge is a growing point of tension in risk assets between momentum and overvaluation. Assets with the strongest fundamentals have the most stretched relative valuations, and vice versa. The economic and policy risks for 2025 will help determine whether momentum or valuations dominate investment returns in the coming year.\n\nBalance of risks favors bonds\n\nHigher starting yields have greatly improved the risk-return tradeoff in fixed income. Bonds are still back. Over the next decade, we expect 4.3%–5.3% annualized returns for both U.S. and global ex-U.S. currency-hedged bonds. This view reflects a gradual normalization in policy rates and yield curves, though important near-term risks remain.\n\nWe believe that yields across the curve are likely to remain above 4% in the U.S. A scenario where supply-side tailwinds persist will be supportive for trend growth and thus real rates. Alternatively, the emerging risks related to global trade and immigration policies would also keep rates high due to increased inflation expectations. These risks must be balanced with the possibility that a growth shock, and any associated monetary easing or “flight to safety,” would cause yields to fall meaningfully from current levels.\n\nHigher starting yields, which imply a “coupon wall,” mean that future bond returns are less exposed to modest increases in yields. In fact, for investors with the time horizon to see coupon payments catch up, interest rates that rise further would improve their total returns despite some near-term pain. We continue to believe fixed income plays an important role as a ballast in long-term portfolios. The greatest downside risk to bonds also pertains to stocks—namely, a rise in long-term rates due to continued fiscal-deficit spending or removal of supply-side support. These are the dynamics we are most closely monitoring.\n\nRational or irrational exuberance: Only time will tell \n\nU.S. equities have generally delivered strong returns in recent years. 2024 was no exception, with both earnings growth and price/earnings ratios exceeding expectations. The key question for investors is, “What happens next?”\n\nIn our view, U.S. valuations are elevated but not as stretched as traditional metrics imply. Despite higher interest rates, many large corporations insulated themselves from tighter monetary policy by locking in low financing costs ahead of time. And more importantly, the market has been increasingly concentrated toward growth-oriented sectors, such as technology, that support higher valuations.\n\nNevertheless, the likelihood that we are in the midst of a valuation-supporting productivity boom, akin to the mid-1990s, must be balanced with the possibility that the current environment may be more analogous to 1999. In the latter scenario, a negative economic development could expose the vulnerability of current stock market valuations.\n\nWhile the median of our U.S. return outlook over the next decade appears cautious, the range of possible outcomes is wide and valuations are rarely a good timing tool. Ultimately, high starting valuations will drag long-term returns down. But history shows that, absent an economic or earnings growth shock, U.S. equity market returns can continue to defy their valuation gravity in the near term.\n\nInternational valuations are more attractive. We suspect this could continue as these economies are likely to be most exposed to rising global economic and policy risks. Differences in long-term price/earnings ratios are the biggest driver of relative returns over five-plus years, but economic growth and profits matter more over shorter horizons. Over the past few years, persistently lackluster growth in the economies and earnings outside of the U.S. kept international returns lukewarm relative to the remarkable return in the U.S. market. Within emerging markets, China is the sole reason valuations are below fair value, but the risks of rising trade tensions and insufficient fiscal stimulus in China pose additional headwinds.\n\n**IMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.

VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.**\n\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\n\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model® is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\n\nVanguard Information and Insights\n\nSubscribe to Vanguard. \n\nGet Vanguard news, insights, and timely analysis on the market, delivered straight to your inbox. \n\nSubscribe\n\nRead our [online privacy notice](https://investor.vanguard.com/privacy-center/online-privacy-notice) to learn about how we keep personal information private. \n\n![Vanguard logo](/etc.clientlibs/corporatesite/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/icons/vanguardLogos/VanguardLogo.svg)\n\nVanguard is the trusted name in investing.

Two Active Municipal ETFs\n\nVALLEY FORGE, PA (November 21, 2024)—Vanguard today launched Vanguard Core Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VCRM) and Vanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VSDM), two active municipal ETFs managed by Vanguard Fixed Income Group. The new ETFs offer diversified exposure to municipal bonds across sectors, states, and credit quality with the potential to outperform their benchmarks over the long term.\n\n\"These new ETFs combine our top-tier active fixed income capabilities with our expert municipal bond team, all within an actively managed ETF wrapper that's becoming an essential for many investors,” said Sara Devereux, Global Head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group. “We envision these ETFs playing an integral role in investors’ portfolios; with Vanguard Core Tax-Exempt sitting centrally as part of their tax-exempt allocation and Vanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt leveraging our expert active capabilities, helping investors to get the most out of their short-term allocation.”\n\nVanguard Core Tax-Exempt Bond ETF offers broad exposure to high-quality municipal bonds with an expense ratio of just 0.12% compared with the average expense ratio for competing funds of 0.36%.1 It will be managed by industry veteran Stephen McFee. With two decades of experience at Vanguard, McFee has successfully managed several active mutual funds and indexed ETFs in our fixed income offerings.\n\nVanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt Bond ETF is designed for investors seeking tax-exempt municipal income at the short end of the yield curve. Investors in the ETF can expect a portfolio of short-duration and primarily high-quality, investment-grade municipal bonds that generates tax-exempt income with lower interest rate sensitivity. Adam Ferguson, who has successfully managed Vanguard municipal funds for more than 20 years, will oversee management for this fund. It has an estimated expense ratio of 0.12%, compared with the average of 0.27%1 for competing funds.\n\nVanguard Core Tax-Exempt Bond ETF and Vanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt Bond ETF provide an active counterpart to Vanguard’s existing suite of index municipal ETFs and build on Vanguard’s growing active fixed income ETFs alongside the recently launched Vanguard Core Bond ETF (VCRB) and Vanguard Core-Plus Bond ETF (VPLS).\n\n**Vanguard Fixed Income Group**\n\nWith more than $2.4 trillion globally in fixed income assets under management, Vanguard Fixed Income Group is one of the world’s largest managers of bond mutual funds and ETFs,2 overseeing the full spectrum of fixed income asset classes and sectors. The new ETFs will be managed by Vanguard Fixed Income Group’s municipal team, which has proven expertise and a track record of producing strong client outcomes across Vanguard’s extensive municipal bond fund lineup. The municipal team includes 40 tenured portfolio managers, traders, and analysts, who leverage their deep experience, scale, and sophisticated processes to navigate this complex segment of the fixed income market.\n\nVanguard’s track record as an investment manager remains unparalleled—95% of Vanguard active fixed income funds outperformed their peer group averages over the past ten years ended September 30, 2024.3\n\n###\n\n**About Vanguard**\n\nFounded in 1975, Vanguard is one of the world's leading investment management companies. The firm offers investments, advice, and retirement services to individual investors, institutions, and financial professionals. Vanguard operates under a unique, investor-owned structure where Vanguard’s fund shareholder clients own the funds, which in turn own Vanguard. As such, Vanguard adheres to a simple purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success. For more information, visit [vanguard.com](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/).\n\nAll figures as of September 30, 2024, unless stated otherwise.\n\n1 Morningstar data as of September 30, 2024.\n\n2 Assets under management figures as of September 30, 2024\n\n3 For the ten-year period ended September 30, 42 of 44 Vanguard active bond funds outperformed their peer group averages; results will vary for other time periods. Only funds with a minimum ten-year history were included in the comparisons.

Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.**\n\n**_Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling._**\n\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\n\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.\n\nAlthough the income from a municipal bond fund is exempt from federal tax, you may owe taxes on any capital gains realized through the fund's trading or through your own redemption of shares. For some investors, a portion of the fund's income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.\n\nVanguard Marketing Corporation, Distributor.\n\n[Contact Public Relations](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html#14)\n\nVanguard Information and Insights\n\nSubscribe to News releases. \n\nGet Vanguard news, insights, and timely analysis on the market, delivered straight to your inbox. \n\nEmail Address* (name@email.com)\n\nIndustry* Select industry...

is often similar no matter what’s driving the volatility, whether it’s an unexpected headline, a presidential election, or a Federal Reserve change in borrowing rates. While volatility can lead some investors to question their portfolio allocations, it doesn’t mean that anything is suddenly wrong with any ETFs they hold.\n\n[Vanguard ETF Industry Perspectives Q3 2024](/content/dam/corp/articles/pdf/2024_q3_etf_perspectives_brochure.pdf)(10-page PDF) is our in-depth quarterly commentary featuring the latest ETF insights, with analysis of how important trends may affect ETF investors. \n\nKey highlights\n\nEquity spotlight\n\nThe Fed’s 50-basis-point rate cut—its first cut since before the Fed began raising rates in response to the inflationary spike driven by the COVID-19 pandemic—created a fresh opportunity to look closely at small-cap equities, which historically have outperformed the broader market after rate cuts.\n\nSmall-capitalization ETF flows are on the rise—a pattern that has historically coincided with interest rate cuts. Small-cap stocks do tend to outperform, but small-cap indexes don’t all behave the same. It’s best to choose an index with a strategy that’s aligned with your goals. \n\nFixed income spotlight\n\nWith the September 18 cut that lowered the federal funds rate from 5.25%–5.5% to 4.75%–5%, markets entered a new phase of loosening borrowing costs. This will be the first real test for the active core and core-plus fixed income ETFs that launched during the current cycle. An interesting facet of these active ETFs is that many managers didn’t change their risk exposures—namely, duration and credit quality—all that much in the lead-up to the September cut.\n\nIndustry trends\n\nHeightened volatility over the third quarter, which included that rate cut, showcased how ETFs can be affected. Bid-ask spreads immediately widened on the Fed’s announcement, reinforcing the need when markets become volatile to follow best trading practices or to avoid trading altogether.\n\nWith high volatility also surrounding the global stock market sell-off on August 5, which pulled the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down by as much as 6%, index fund managers and advisors alike are reminded of the importance of controlling impulses and staying the course.\n\nETF Perspectives: Q3 2024\n\n[ Open PDF ](/content/dam/corp/articles/pdf/2024_q3_etf_perspectives_brochure.pdf)\n\nRelated Links\n\n![](/content/dam/corp/articles/images/roger_aliaga_diaz_social.jpg)\n\nArticle\n\n![](/etc.clientlibs/corporatesite/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/icons/media-icons/Article.svg)\n\n9 min read\n\n[Fed cuts: How far matters more than how fast](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/fed-cuts-how-far-matters-more-than-how-fast.html \"Open Fed cuts: How far matters more than how fast\")\n\nNov 04, 2024\n\nArticle\n\n![](/etc.clientlibs/corporatesite/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/icons/media-icons/Article.svg)\n\n8 min read\n\n[Our investment and economic outlook, October 2024 ](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/investment-economic-outlook-oct-2024.html \"Open Our investment and economic outlook, October 2024 \")\n\nOct 17, 2024\n\nArticle\n\n![](/etc.clientlibs/corporatesite/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/icons/media-icons/Article.svg)\n\n2 min read\n\n[ETF trends: Diversification grows amid rate uncertainty](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/etf-trends-diversification-grows-amid-rate-uncertainty.html \"Open ETF trends: Diversification grows amid rate uncertainty\")\n\nAug 14, 2024\n\n[ Check out our perspectives library ](/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/what-we-think/perspectives-and-commentary.html)\n\n#### Notes:\n\n**Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars.

The utility\nfunction captures the trade-off any investor faces in balancing the desire for higher portfolio returns with the increased risk that comes with it. Utility\nfunctions are widely used in finance, and have been increasingly adopted by investment professionals and practitioners.\n9\nFollowing the process laid out in Figure 5, we expected hedged global bond market return\nidentified the risk aversion that yielded a 60/40 to show the relationship.

These improvements will allow\nworkers to experience a smoother savings journey and increase the\nlikelihood of retirement success.\n● The typical U.S. worker has nine employers over the course of their career.\nThe median job switcher sees a 10% increase in pay but a 0.7 percentage\npoint decline in their retirement saving rate when they switch employers.\n● The current design of many 401(k) plans does not account for repeated job\nswitches. The benefits of plan features that encourage greater retirement\nsavings, such as automatic enrollment and automatic escalation, can be\ndiminished with each job transition when plan features do not line up from\nemployer to employer. Automatic enrollment may help dampen the drop in\nsavings that is common when switching jobs by increasing participation, but if\nit’s paired with low default rates, participants may still experience a significant\ndrop in savings. However, at a 6% or higher default saving rate, workers tend to\nmaintain their savings momentum.\n● The impact that a retirement savings slowdown can have on workers who switch\njobs across employers is significant. For a worker earning $60,000 at the start\nof their career who switches jobs eight times across employers (for a total of nine\njobs), the estimated loss in potential retirement savings could be about $300,000—\nenough to fund an estimated six additional years of spending in retirement.\nAuthors\nFiona Greig, Ph.D. Kelly Hahn Fu Tan, Ph.D.\nIntroduction\nThe most common retirement savings vehicle for default rate of 6% or more, the most common\nmany workers today is the 401(k).

The participant-weighted participant rate is 82%. See How America Saves (Vanguard, 2024).\n2 The total is based on Investment Company Institute quarterly retirement market data as of Q1 2024.\n3 In the last two decades, significant research has been conducted on the impact of 401(k) automatic enrollment and default options on participants and\nsaving rates. See Choi et al. (2004), Beshears et al. (2009), Beshears et al. (2023), Choi et al. (2024), and Choukhmane (2021).\n4 The number of plans with a 6% or more default saving rate has grown from 15% in 2014 to 29% in 2023, according to Vanguard’s How America Saves 2024.\nStarting in 2025, the SECURE 2.0 Act will require companies with new 401(k) and 403(b) plans to automatically enroll their employees into those plans at a\nminimum saving rate between 3% and 10% and increase the rate by 1% per year until it reaches 10% to 15%.\n5 The number of jobs held by a typical worker between ages 25 and 64 is based on median job tenure by age group from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’\nEmployee Tenure in 2022 report. We assume a median job switcher changes jobs every 3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every\n7 years from ages 45 to 54, and every 10 years from ages 55 to 64. Supporting this, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Number of Jobs, Labor Market\nExperience, Marital Status, and Health for Those Born 1957–1964 report from August 2023 provides a similar estimate. The National Longitudinal Survey of\nYouth 1979, cited in that report, indicates an average of 8 jobs held from age 22 to 56. However, it does not extend job count estimates beyond age 56 due\nto limited data on older age groups, and therefore does not cover up to the average retirement age of 65.\n6 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employee Tenure 2022 report shows the median tenure of workers ages 25 and over was 4.9 years using the Bureau’s\nCurrent Population Survey.\n7 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employee Tenure 2022 report shows that certain service sectors exhibit higher employee turnover. Median tenure for\nworkers ages 16 and over for retail trade is 2.8 years and for leisure and hospitality is 2 years.\n2\nUntil recently, there has been little research on Data sample used in this study\nhow these pervasive job transitions impact saving\nUsing Vanguard administrative data of workers\nbehaviors and retirement outcomes.8 In this\nfor whom Vanguard is recordkeeper for both\nstudy, we document individual workers’ changes\nthe previous and current employer’s 401(k) plans,\nin income and savings as they switch jobs across\nwe constructed a panel of workers who changed\nemployers with differing retirement plan designs\ntheir jobs between 2015 and 2022.\nusing Vanguard administrative data on over\n54,000 workers for whom Vanguard serves as\nWe first documented the income and savings\nrecordkeeper for both the previous and current\ndynamics among job switchers (Finding 1).\nemployer’s 401(k) plans.\nWe captured income data for a subset of the\npopulation (“income sample”) comprising 23,521\nWe observe that, despite having an increase\njob switchers from 779 employers.

Choukhmane\n(2021) estimated the effect of automatic enrollment after employees change jobs. Their research found no evidence that automatic enrollment creates long-\nlasting saving habits.\n9 We include only those job switchers who joined their new company within one year of leaving their previous jobs. We also restrict the sample to include only\nthose job switchers with one active plan with their previous employer and one active plan with their next employer.\n10 To better understand the impact of default plan features on 401(k) contributions during job switches, we studied the pre-tax employee saving behavior.\nThe full sample includes workers for whom we may not have income information.\n3\nFinding 1:\nMany job switchers experience a fall in retirement savings in both percentage\nand dollar terms, despite income growth.\nIn percentage terms: The typical (median) job The magnitude of the saving rate slowdown was\nswitcher experienced a 10% pay increase in our larger for those who saw only a modest increase\nincome sample (Figure 2).

See details of the data sample in the Appendix.\nSource: Vanguard.\n11 The calculation of lifetime lost savings is based on the assumption of eight job changes during a worker’s career from age 25 to 64 (for a total of nine jobs).\nIt is assumed that the worker changes jobs every 3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every 7 years from ages 45 to 54, and\nevery 10 years from ages 55 to 64. A one-time lost savings amount of $764 ($1,274 less $510) is assumed at each job change, assuming no auto-escalation.\nWhen assuming auto-escalation, a one-time lost savings amount of $1,396 ($1,906 less $510) is assumed at each job change; $1,906 reflects a\n1 percentage point increase in the previous saving rate at the increased salary. In years without job changes, no lost savings are assumed. These lost savings\nare compounded annually from age 25 to 64 using a deterministic annual portfolio return, based on the 10-year average returns of a 60/40 stock to bond\nportfolio (6.4%) as per Vanguard research. The foregone wealth is calculated as the present value of these recurring one-time lost savings over all job\nchanges, using a deterministic annual inflation rate of 2%.\n5\nFinding 2:\nAutomatic enrollment increases participation, but low default rates drag savings down.\nWe find that the slowdown in saving rate that worker who joined a voluntary enrollment plan\nmany workers experience through a job change is experienced a saving rate decline of 1 percentage\nrelated to plan design.

We assume nominal salary increases\nof 2% until retirement at age 65. The retirement savings are projected to grow at a steady nominal rate of 6.4%, based on the 10-year average returns of\na 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, as detailed in Vanguard’s economic and market outlook for 2024. Additionally, we assume that the worker changes jobs every\n3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every 7 years from ages 45 to 54, and every 10 years from ages 55 to 64 (see Figure 1 on page\n2). To isolate the impacts of plan design alone, we apply this wage trajectory to all three scenarios. If we were to instead apply stronger nominal wage\ngrowth assumptions in the case of job switchers (10% for ages 25–34, 5% for ages 35–44, 3% for ages 45–54, and 2% for ages 55–64), retirement wealth\nwould be roughly $580,000 under scenario 2 and $890,000 under scenario 3.\n16 We assume a 50% match of the first 6% of the salary employee contribution because it is the most common employer match formula (Vanguard, 2024).\n17 Retirement expenditures are estimated to be $48,000 annually (in 2024 dollars), which represents 80% replacement of pre-retirement income.

The “typical plan with no job changes” scenario assumes that the worker starts with a saving rate of\n3% and increases this by 1 percentage point each year until reaching 10%, which is then maintained until retirement at age 65.

Real-\nworld investor decisions, however, suggest that portfolio selection depends on\nthe intersection of multiple dimensions of risk and return, from systematic risk\nand volatility to active alpha, tracking error, and implicit risk factor exposures.\n● The Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), a proprietary model for\ndetermining asset allocation among active, passive, and factor investment\nvehicles, simultaneously optimizes across three dimensions of risk-return\ntrade-offs: alpha, systematic, and factor. The model incorporates Vanguard’s\nforward-looking capital market return projections as well as client expectations\nfor alpha risk and return to create portfolios consistent with the full set of\ninvestor preferences.\n● The VAAM can solve portfolio construction problems that conventional\napproaches address in an ad hoc and suboptimal manner. The result is more\nappropriate active-passive-factor portfolio solutions to common investor\nobjectives and asset allocation problems. These solutions include multiasset\nportfolios that help achieve investor objectives such as (1) wealth growth,\n(2) risk hedging, and (3) return targets using investment methodologies\nincluding model-based strategic asset allocation, active-passive asset\nallocation, and time-varying asset allocation.\nAuthors\nRoger A.

For instance, all else being equal, one\nwould expect reducing systematic risk aversion—\nthat is, decreasing the penalty toward dispersion\nof asset-class returns—to increase the equity\nallocation in a multiasset portfolio. We show\nthis relationship in Figure 7a, where the total\nequity allocation increases as the systematic\nrisk aversion decreases.\nBy design, lowering alpha risk aversion (the\npenalty toward dispersion of factor-adjusted\nalpha distribution) should increase the active\nallocation in the portfolio. Figure 7b confirms\nthat idea, as the allocation to a U.S. active fund\nas a percentage of the total U.S. equity allocation\n(active and passive) increases as the alpha risk\naversion is lowered.5 Similarly, Figure 7c shows\nthat lowering factor risk aversion increases the\nallocation to factor exposure in the portfolio as\na percentage of U.S. equity allocation. In this\nexample, we assess the allocation of U.S. equity\npassive factor vehicles relative to total U.S.\nequity allocation (active, passive, and factor)\nby keeping the systematic and alpha risk\naversion constant.\n5 The active fund used in this example is the same as the one reported in Figure 3, on page 5.

The dots in\nthe figure represent portfolios with popular ad\nhoc tilts, in contrast to the VAAM optimization\napproach.

The problem with such ad\nhoc tilts is that they ignore correlations among\nassets and can lead to inefficient portfolios.\nPortfolio tilts may be better assessed within an\noptimization framework.

In this case, the\nmodest size of the potential reward may not be\nsubstantial enough to justify a 100% allocation to\nthe active fund, given its uncertainty.\n1 The passive fund in the context of our paper is a market-capitalization-weighted index fund in a single asset or sub-asset class that tracks a specified\nbenchmark—for example, a broad-based U.S. equity index fund that seeks to track the Russell 3000 Index.\n2 The active fund in the context of our paper is a traditional actively managed fund that is in the same asset or sub-asset class as the passive fund but that\nseeks to outperform the segment’s benchmark—for example, a U.S. equity active fund that uses bottom-up security selection to seek to outperform the\nRussell 3000 Index.\n3 For more context on using index and active fund strategies in gaining exposures to chosen market segments, please see Lawrence, Patterson, and Ertl (2024)\nand Patterson, Lawrence, and Ertl (2024).\n4 Gross alpha can also be referred to as gross excess return. For consistency and ease of comparison with passive strategies, we will refer to it as alpha in this paper.\n5 The performance of the “average dollar invested” considers the asset-weighted performance of all funds within that strategy.\n6 Active funds, on average, tend to have higher expense ratios as well as higher tax costs for investors subject to tax. As an example, see Philips, Kinniry, Walker,\nSchlanger, and Hirt (2014).\n7 Active risk is typically measured by metrics such as tracking error and often the terms are used interchangeably. For consistency and ease of communication,\nwe will refer to the uncertainty of future manager performance as active risk throughout this paper.\n2\nBut what about a 5% allocation to this fund as FIGURE 1\npart of a market segment exposure that includes Active-passive decision-making during\nboth active and passive funds?8 What about 25%? portfolio construction\nHow does the level of active risk inherent in the\na.

These are the questions we\nask in this paper.\nWe aim to assist the active-passive decision-\nmaking process by enabling investors to think\nmore deliberately about their return expectations\nand the expected risks they’re willing to accept.\nOur framework makes these expectations explicit,\na valuable contribution to ongoing due diligence\nand regular assessment of the conditions and\nexpectations that justify a given active-passive mix.9\nThe active-passive decision framework\nTypically, the portfolio construction process\nbegins with establishing an appropriate strategic\nasset allocation. A second—but still important—\ndecision then is made on how to implement the\nchosen asset class and sub-asset class exposures.\nIt is at this second step that specific investment\nproducts are evaluated and the decision to\nallocate between active and passive investments\nis made. See Figure 1 for an illustration of the\nhierarchy of portfolio decisions.\n8 Market segments can be defined as broadly, such as equities and bonds, or as narrowly, such as industry sectors, as an investor desires.\n9 Grinold (1989) outlines the need for conviction in, and an accurate assessment of skill on the part of, the active manager or investors in active funds.\nThese should inform risk and return expectations and are therefore vital to allocation decisions involving active and index funds.\n3\nnruteR\nOptimized efficient frontier\nRisk\nb.

Funds that died or merged were included in the analysis. This generates a sample of n=2,569 funds. The\noldest single share class was used to represent a fund when multiple share classes existed. Asset-weighted results were calculated using each fund’s average reported\nmonthly assets for months when that fund existed. Alpha was calculated by regressing monthly gross returns minus the risk-free rate of return against the Fama-\nFrench five-factor model (2015); tracking error was calculated as the standard error of the regression. The graph is cropped to display the main body of the data,\nmeaning a small number of outliers are not shown.\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Morningstar, Inc., and the Kenneth R. French data library.\n20 It is important to remember that there can be additional costs beyond a fund’s expense ratio—for example, tax costs. Although tax costs vary among investors,\ncountries, funds, and time frames, the tax costs of active funds have been, in many periods, higher than those of index funds. Donaldson et al. (2015) contains\nfurther discussion.\n10\nPart One results: When alpha and cost are everything\nAfter running the two critical attributes of gross\nalpha expectation and cost through our model\n(with no consideration for active risk or active-\nrisk tolerance), we arrived at the results shown in\nFigure 8.

(2019). An investor with a lower level of active-risk tolerance could be\nthought of as one who has either a strictly defined tracking error budget or a lower likelihood of remaining invested in an active fund during periods of\nunderperformance. An investor with a higher level of active-risk tolerance, on the other hand, would likely have a more flexible active-risk budget (if one is\nused at all) and expect to remain invested during periods of underperformance.\n12\nPart Two results: When net alpha and risk Figure 9 for investors with neutral (or worse) gross\nconsiderations lead to a wider range of outcomes alpha expectations remained unchanged from the\nCombining the elements of active risk and active- Part One analysis (see Figure 8).

These improvements will allow\nworkers to experience a smoother savings journey and increase the\nlikelihood of retirement success.\n● The typical U.S. worker has nine employers over the course of their career.\nThe median job switcher sees a 10% increase in pay but a 0.7 percentage\npoint decline in their retirement saving rate when they switch employers.\n● The current design of many 401(k) plans does not account for repeated job\nswitches. The benefits of plan features that encourage greater retirement\nsavings, such as automatic enrollment and automatic escalation, can be\ndiminished with each job transition when plan features do not line up from\nemployer to employer. Automatic enrollment may help dampen the drop in\nsavings that is common when switching jobs by increasing participation, but if\nit’s paired with low default rates, participants may still experience a significant\ndrop in savings. However, at a 6% or higher default saving rate, workers tend to\nmaintain their savings momentum.\n● The impact that a retirement savings slowdown can have on workers who switch\njobs across employers is significant. For a worker earning $60,000 at the start\nof their career who switches jobs eight times across employers (for a total of nine\njobs), the estimated loss in potential retirement savings could be about $300,000—\nenough to fund an estimated six additional years of spending in retirement.\nAuthors\nFiona Greig, Ph.D. Kelly Hahn Fu Tan, Ph.D.\nIntroduction\nThe most common retirement savings vehicle for default rate of 6% or more, the most common\nmany workers today is the 401(k).

The participant-weighted participant rate is 82%. See How America Saves (Vanguard, 2024).\n2 The total is based on Investment Company Institute quarterly retirement market data as of Q1 2024.\n3 In the last two decades, significant research has been conducted on the impact of 401(k) automatic enrollment and default options on participants and\nsaving rates. See Choi et al. (2004), Beshears et al. (2009), Beshears et al. (2023), Choi et al. (2024), and Choukhmane (2021).\n4 The number of plans with a 6% or more default saving rate has grown from 15% in 2014 to 29% in 2023, according to Vanguard’s How America Saves 2024.\nStarting in 2025, the SECURE 2.0 Act will require companies with new 401(k) and 403(b) plans to automatically enroll their employees into those plans at a\nminimum saving rate between 3% and 10% and increase the rate by 1% per year until it reaches 10% to 15%.\n5 The number of jobs held by a typical worker between ages 25 and 64 is based on median job tenure by age group from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’\nEmployee Tenure in 2022 report. We assume a median job switcher changes jobs every 3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every\n7 years from ages 45 to 54, and every 10 years from ages 55 to 64. Supporting this, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Number of Jobs, Labor Market\nExperience, Marital Status, and Health for Those Born 1957–1964 report from August 2023 provides a similar estimate. The National Longitudinal Survey of\nYouth 1979, cited in that report, indicates an average of 8 jobs held from age 22 to 56. However, it does not extend job count estimates beyond age 56 due\nto limited data on older age groups, and therefore does not cover up to the average retirement age of 65.\n6 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employee Tenure 2022 report shows the median tenure of workers ages 25 and over was 4.9 years using the Bureau’s\nCurrent Population Survey.\n7 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employee Tenure 2022 report shows that certain service sectors exhibit higher employee turnover. Median tenure for\nworkers ages 16 and over for retail trade is 2.8 years and for leisure and hospitality is 2 years.\n2\nUntil recently, there has been little research on Data sample used in this study\nhow these pervasive job transitions impact saving\nUsing Vanguard administrative data of workers\nbehaviors and retirement outcomes.8 In this\nfor whom Vanguard is recordkeeper for both\nstudy, we document individual workers’ changes\nthe previous and current employer’s 401(k) plans,\nin income and savings as they switch jobs across\nwe constructed a panel of workers who changed\nemployers with differing retirement plan designs\ntheir jobs between 2015 and 2022.\nusing Vanguard administrative data on over\n54,000 workers for whom Vanguard serves as\nWe first documented the income and savings\nrecordkeeper for both the previous and current\ndynamics among job switchers (Finding 1).\nemployer’s 401(k) plans.\nWe captured income data for a subset of the\npopulation (“income sample”) comprising 23,521\nWe observe that, despite having an increase\njob switchers from 779 employers.

(2024) estimated that job switches mute the effects automatic enrollment and automatic escalation policies across nine firms. Choukhmane\n(2021) estimated the effect of automatic enrollment after employees change jobs. Their research found no evidence that automatic enrollment creates long-\nlasting saving habits.\n9 We include only those job switchers who joined their new company within one year of leaving their previous jobs. We also restrict the sample to include only\nthose job switchers with one active plan with their previous employer and one active plan with their next employer.\n10 To better understand the impact of default plan features on 401(k) contributions during job switches, we studied the pre-tax employee saving behavior.\nThe full sample includes workers for whom we may not have income information.\n3\nFinding 1:\nMany job switchers experience a fall in retirement savings in both percentage\nand dollar terms, despite income growth.\nIn percentage terms: The typical (median) job The magnitude of the saving rate slowdown was\nswitcher experienced a 10% pay increase in our larger for those who saw only a modest increase\nincome sample (Figure 2).

The figure shows the median change in saving rate and savings amount against the midpoint of each\nincome growth range. We display data points between –40% and 70% change in income in order to focus on the range that pertains to most job switchers. We\nmeasure the savings behavior changes as the difference between the one-year average employee contribution deferral rate in the first year at the new job and the\none-year average employee contribution deferral rate in the last year at the previous job. We consider only the effective deferral rates for salary because of the\ndifficulty in consistently identifying bonus compensation across employers. The calculations are based on the income sample of 23,521 workers across 779 plans\nwho switched jobs between 2015 and 2022. The sample is limited to those workers for whom Vanguard serves as recordkeeper for both the previous and current\nemployer’s 401(k) plans and for whom we also observe both income and saving rates. See details of the data sample in the Appendix.\nSource: Vanguard.\n11 The calculation of lifetime lost savings is based on the assumption of eight job changes during a worker’s career from age 25 to 64 (for a total of nine jobs).\nIt is assumed that the worker changes jobs every 3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every 7 years from ages 45 to 54, and\nevery 10 years from ages 55 to 64. A one-time lost savings amount of $764 ($1,274 less $510) is assumed at each job change, assuming no auto-escalation.\nWhen assuming auto-escalation, a one-time lost savings amount of $1,396 ($1,906 less $510) is assumed at each job change; $1,906 reflects a\n1 percentage point increase in the previous saving rate at the increased salary. In years without job changes, no lost savings are assumed. These lost savings\nare compounded annually from age 25 to 64 using a deterministic annual portfolio return, based on the 10-year average returns of a 60/40 stock to bond\nportfolio (6.4%) as per Vanguard research. The foregone wealth is calculated as the present value of these recurring one-time lost savings over all job\nchanges, using a deterministic annual inflation rate of 2%.\n5\nFinding 2:\nAutomatic enrollment increases participation, but low default rates drag savings down.\nWe find that the slowdown in saving rate that worker who joined a voluntary enrollment plan\nmany workers experience through a job change is experienced a saving rate decline of 1 percentage\nrelated to plan design.

We assume nominal salary increases\nof 2% until retirement at age 65. The retirement savings are projected to grow at a steady nominal rate of 6.4%, based on the 10-year average returns of\na 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, as detailed in Vanguard’s economic and market outlook for 2024. Additionally, we assume that the worker changes jobs every\n3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every 7 years from ages 45 to 54, and every 10 years from ages 55 to 64 (see Figure 1 on page\n2). To isolate the impacts of plan design alone, we apply this wage trajectory to all three scenarios. If we were to instead apply stronger nominal wage\ngrowth assumptions in the case of job switchers (10% for ages 25–34, 5% for ages 35–44, 3% for ages 45–54, and 2% for ages 55–64), retirement wealth\nwould be roughly $580,000 under scenario 2 and $890,000 under scenario 3.\n16 We assume a 50% match of the first 6% of the salary employee contribution because it is the most common employer match formula (Vanguard, 2024).\n17 Retirement expenditures are estimated to be $48,000 annually (in 2024 dollars), which represents 80% replacement of pre-retirement income. The $300,000\nin foregone wealth is estimated to be able to sustain slightly over six years of total annual retirement expenses.\n10\nFIGURE 9\nDefault saving rates need to account for the realities of job changes\nto improve retirement outcomes\nHypothetical total contribution rate by age in different scenarios\nRetirement savings\nat age 65 (2024 dollars)\n14%\n$800,000\n$730,000\n12 (9% lower)\n$470,000\n10 (41% lower)\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\nAge\nTypical plan with no job change (3% default + match + automatic escalation)\nHigher default plan with eight job changes (6% default + match + automatic escalation)\nTypical plan with eight job changes (3% default + match + automatic escalation)\nNotes: This figure depicts the trajectory of total contribution rates for a hypothetical worker who begins employment at age 25 and retires at age 65. We\nassume that this worker changes jobs every 3 years from ages 25 to 34, every 5 years from ages 35 to 44, every 7 years from ages 45 to 54, and every 10 years\nfrom ages 55 to 64 in scenarios involving job changes. The “typical plan with no job changes” scenario assumes that the worker starts with a saving rate of\n3% and increases this by 1 percentage point each year until reaching 10%, which is then maintained until retirement at age 65. The “higher default plan with\neight job changes” scenario assumes that the worker’s contribution rate resets to a higher default rate of 6% at each job switch, with subsequent annual\nincreases of 1 percentage point until the next change and capped at 10%. The “typical plan with eight job changes” scenario assumes that the worker’s\ncontribution rate resets to the current median default rate of 3% at each job transition, with an annual increase of 1 percentage point until the next job\nchange and capped at 10%. In all scenarios, employees receive a 50% employer match on the first 6% of employee contributions.\nSource: Vanguard.\n11\nPotential solutions to remedy the retirement\nsavings slowdown\nWe present three solutions to consider that vary • Personalized defaults: Our third proposed\nin feasibility and personalization.
