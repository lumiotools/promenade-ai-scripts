(NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n![BrainStorm Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1166536/BrainStorm_Logo.jpg)\n\n\"BrainStorm's primary focus continues to be preparing for the upcoming Phase 3b registration trial of NurOwn in ALS,\" said Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of Brainstorm. \"We have carefully refined the trial design based on the learnings from our previous study, and we believe this will increase the probability of demonstrating a treatment effect. We are partnering with Pluri Inc., an established global leader in the development and manufacturing of cell-based therapeutics, to support the clinical supply needs. We have also selected a leading Clinical Research Organization and continue to work with investigators to establish multiple trial sites. We remain committed to the ALS community as we work to advance NurOwn and deliver a therapeutic option that we believe will make a difference for patients and their families.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * In November 2024, BrainStorm entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Pluri Inc. (Pluri) to manufacture NurOwn® for use in the planned Phase 3b ALS trial. This MOU enables Brainstorm to begin the immediate transfer of its manufacturing technology and start producing NurOwn at Pluri's facility while the binding definitive agreement is being finalized.\n  * In October 2024, Brainstorm announced further details of the Phase 3b trial at the [Annual Northeastern Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Consortium (NEALS) Meeting](https://meeting.neals.org/). \n\n\n  * Up to approximately 200 participants with ALS are expected to enroll in the two-part Phase 3b trial, to receive 3 doses of either NurOwn (debamestrocel) or placebo for 24 weeks (Part-A), followed by an open label period during which all patients will receive 3 doses of NurOwn for another 24 weeks (Part B). Successful completion of Part A is expected to support a Biologic License Application (BLA).\n  * The primary efficacy endpoint will be a comparison of change in ALSFRS-R from baseline to week-24 (i.e. at the end of Part A) for NurOwn vs. placebo. Other outcome assessments will include CAFS (Clinical Assessment of Function & Survival), SVC, HHD (Hand-Held Dynamometry), survival, ALSAQ-40 questionnaire, the ZBI (Zarit Burden Interview), and disease biomarkers.\n  * The entry criteria are specifically targeting people living with ALS in the early stage of their disease. Key entry criteria will include: age 18 to 75 years old, ALS diagnosis defined by the revised El Escorial criteria as laboratory-supported probable, clinically probable, or definite, symptom onset within 24 months of screening, ≥2 points on each item of the ALSFRS-R, ALSFRS-R total score ≤45, and upright Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) ≥65% of predicted.\n  * Participants in both treatment arms will be able to receive standard of care while on study.\n  * Also at the NEALS meeting, Brainstorm presented a poster \"Debamestrocel Long-Term Benefits on Survival and Neurodegeneration in ALS Expanded Access Program\" featuring the results from 10 participants (6 NurOwn, 4 placebo) from the company's prior Phase 3 clinical trial (BCT-002-US) who enrolled in an open label Expanded Access Program (EAP). The EAP spanned two 28-week periods, with a break in time between the periods. Participants received a dose of NurOwn every 8 weeks, for a maximum of 6 doses over the 2 periods.\n\n\n  * Promising long term survival benefits were observed in NurOwn treated patients compared to matched controls in the PRO-ACT database. The survival curves revealed a statistically significant difference in favor of NurOwn (LRT, p= 0.0379) with a median survival time of 46.6 months for the treated group compared to 41.1 months for the matched control.\n  * Consistent reductions in neurofilament light (NfL) were observed both during the randomized Phase 3 trial and in the subsequent EAP period, indicating that patients treated with NurOwn continued to see benefits from extended treatment. NfL is an important biomarker in ALS, measuring neurodegeneration and neural cell death. These data align with the understanding of NurOwn's mechanism of action.\n\n\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nBrainStorm is planning to host a conference call and webcast for the investment community later in Q4 2024 to provide further updates on the NurOwn Phase 3 program. Details will be provided in the near future. \n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounted to approximately $0.35 million, as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses, net, in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $1 million, compared to $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $2 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\n  * Net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $2.7 million as compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net loss per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $0.51 and $0.45, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc**.

(NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of cellular therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Pluri Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUR) through its wholly owned subsidiary (\"Pluri\"), an established global leader in the development and manufacturing of cell-based therapeutics, to manufacture NurOwn® for use in BrainStorm's planned Phase 3b trial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This MOU enables BrainStorm to begin transfer of its manufacturing technology and start producing NurOwn at Pluri's manufacturing facility upon finalizing the binding definitive agreement.\n\n![BrainStorm_Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1166536/BrainStorm_Logo.jpg)\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed agreement, Pluri will provide GMP-compliant manufacturing of NurOwn at its facilities in Israel. This collaboration aims to fulfill essential supply requirements of NurOwn® as BrainStorm advances its Phase 3b clinical trial. Additionally, the two companies are exploring options for manufacturing to support potential future commercial distribution, pending approval of NurOwn.\n\n\"Pluri has become a recognized leader in GMP-compliant clinical manufacturing of cell-based products, known for their exceptional quality standards and strict regulatory compliance,\" said Haro Hartounian, PhD, Chief Operating Officer at BrainStorm. \"Pluri will offer manufacturing capacity to support our Phase 3b clinical trials, in addition to our existing development and clinical manufacturing activities at The Center for Advanced Cellular Therapies (I-ACT) in Israel. We believe that having Pluri's clinical manufacturing facility near BrainStorm's manufacturing and R&D teams will strengthen communication and foster a highly productive collaboration.\"\n\nChaim Lebovits, President and CEO of Brainstorm, added, \"The Phase 3b clinical trial marks a critical step toward potential regulatory approval of NurOwn, \"This MOU with Pluri creates a strong foundation to meet the clinical supply requirements of NurOwn®. The proposed agreement also offers the prospect of establishing an attractive supply arrangement that aligns well with our strategic priorities as we prepare for the operational and financial commitments of the Phase 3b trial.\"\n\nYaky Yanay, CEO and President of Pluri commented, \"We applaud BrainStorm for their commitment to developing a novel cell therapy for ALS. We are eager to utilize our proprietary knowledge, long years of experience and manufacturing capabilities to support their mission of bringing hope to patients and families impacted by this devastating disease.\"\n\nThe Phase 3b trial has been designed to enroll up to approximately 200 participants with ALS. It will be conducted in two parts: In Part A, participants will receive 3 doses of NurOwn or placebo for 24 weeks. This will be followed by an open label period, during which patients from both arms will receive 3 doses NurOwn for another 24 weeks (Part B). The primary efficacy endpoint will be a comparison of change in ALSFRS-R from baseline to week-24 (i.e. at the end of Part A) for NurOwn vs. placebo. Successful completion of Part A of the double-blind Phase 3b study will position BrainStorm to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for regulatory approval, potentially accelerating the path to market.\n\nBrainStorm plans to hold a conference call for investors later in Q4 2024, during which it will provide further updates on the NurOwn Phase 3 clinical program.\n\n[**About NurOwn®**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mxQGlvuf3Du-xUe30P6TXChcgiEuiS8RdUwi055ZCyPx-jyrlNlbdRE1xJ0HyZERfaGvjqrg-G6nsckSiSS9UogSz0yUyd80OchxJCi0AWnFOwGxe3pHbuQ5eblr3WRY)\n\nThe NurOwn® technology platform (autologous MSC-NTF cells) represents a promising investigational therapeutic approach to targeting disease pathways important in neurodegenerative disorders. MSC-NTF cells are harvested from each person with ALS and are manufactured using an innovative and proprietary process, to secrete neurotrophic factors to target specific neurodegenerative diseases. The lead program for NurOwn is for the treatment of ALS. BrainStorm's long-term commitment to ALS is demonstrated in preclinical research and a series of clinical studies, all of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe NurOwn clinical program has generated valuable insights into the pathology of ALS, as well as disease progression and treatment. Since the initial Phase 3 readout, BrainStorm has shared the full dataset through rigorous peer-reviewed analysis, including: quantification of Floor Effect, which had been noted, but never before explored in depth; evaluation of multiple pre-specified biomarkers, collected at seven different points across 20 weeks during the trial, allowing a longitudinal view; and analysis of genetic data, which represents one of the first ALS trials to prospectively invoke pharmacogenomic analysis of clinical outcome, offering great promise for the development of future treatments for ALS.\n\n**About Pluri Inc.**\n\nPluri™ is pushing the boundaries of science and engineering to create cell-based products for commercial use and is pioneering a biotech revolution that promotes global well-being and sustainability.
