For the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects Core Illumina\nrevenue of ~$1.07 billion. The company is raising its guidance for Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to a\nrange of 21% to 21.5%, and for Core Illumina non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $4.05 to $4.15 for fiscal year\n2024.\nThe company provides forward-looking guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The company is unable to provide a\nreconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported\nfinancial measures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of items such as acquisition-\nrelated expenses, gains and losses from strategic investments, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration,\npotential future asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without\nunreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could\nhave a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the company is\nunable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\n2\nConference call information\nThe conference call will begin at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) on Monday, November 4, 2024.\nInterested parties may access the live teleconference through the Investor Info section of Illumina’s website\nat investor.illumina.com. Alternatively, individuals can access the call by dialing 877.400.0505 or +1.323.701.0225\noutside North America, both using conference ID 2966739. To ensure timely connection, please dial in at least ten\nminutes before the scheduled start of the call.\nA replay of the conference call will be posted on Illumina’s website after the event and will be available for at least\n30 days following.\nStatement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe company reports non-GAAP results for diluted earnings per share, net income, gross margin, operating\nexpenses, including research and development expense, selling general and administrative expense, legal\ncontingencies and settlement, and goodwill and intangible impairment, operating income, operating margin, gross\nprofit, other income (expense), tax provision, constant currency revenue growth, and free cash flow (on a\nconsolidated and, as applicable, segment basis) in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial\nmeasures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial\ncharges such as amortization of acquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the reconciliations of\nGAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency\ntranslation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in\nanalyzing and assessing past and future operating performance. Non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share\nand operating margin are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company’s board of directors to\nmeasure, in part, management’s performance and determine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-\nGAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business.\nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\nUse of forward-looking statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important\nfactors to which our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-\nlooking statements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of\ncustomer orders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our\nrevenue expectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of\nproducts and services competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and\nlaunching new products and services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on\nthird-party suppliers for critical components; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and\nservices on existing products and services; (viii) our ability to modify our business strategies to accomplish our\ndesired operational goals; (ix) our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future actions to streamline\nand improve our R&D processes, reduce our operating expenses and maximize our revenue growth; (x) our ability\nto further develop and commercialize our instruments, consumables, and products; (xi) to deploy new products,\nservices, and applications, and to expand the markets for our technology platforms; (xii) the risks and costs\nassociated with the divestment of GRAIL; (xiii) the risk of additional litigation arising against us in connection with\nthe GRAIL acquisition; (xiv) our ability to obtain approval by third-party payors to reimburse patients for our\nproducts; (xv) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products from government agencies; (xvi) our ability\nto successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop new products, expand markets, and\ngrow our business; (xvii) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions, including as a result of slowing\nor uncertain economic growth or armed conflict; (xviii) the application of generally accepted accounting principles,\nwhich are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments and (xix) legislative,\nregulatory and economic developments, together with other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in information disclosed in\npublic conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

As a result, certain amounts may\nnot recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.\nStatement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe company reports non-GAAP results for diluted earnings per share, net income, gross margin, operating expenses,\nincluding research and development expense, selling general and administrative expense, legal contingencies and\nsettlement, and goodwill and intangible impairment, operating income, operating margin, gross profit, other income\n(expense), tax provision, constant currency revenue growth, and free cash flow (on a consolidated and, as applicable,\nsegment basis) in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. The company’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of\nacquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the\neffects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating\nperformance. Non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share and operating margin are key components of the\nfinancial metrics utilized by the company’s board of directors to measure, in part, management’s performance and\ndetermine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP\ninformation and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\nThe company provides forward-looking guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The company is unable to provide a\nreconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial\nmeasures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of items such as acquisition-related\nexpenses, gains and losses from strategic investments, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, potential\nfuture asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without unreasonable\neffort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could have a material\nimpact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the\nsignificance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\nUse of forward-looking statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to\nwhich our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking\nstatements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of customer\norders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our revenue\nexpectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of products and\nservices competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products\nand services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical\ncomponents; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and\nservices; (viii) our ability to modify our business strategies to accomplish our desired operational goals; (ix) our ability to\nrealize the anticipated benefits from prior or future actions to streamline and improve our R&D processes, reduce our\noperating expenses and maximize our revenue growth; (x) our ability to further develop and commercialize our\ninstruments, consumables, and products; (xi) to deploy new products, services, and applications, and to expand the\nmarkets for our technology platforms; (xii) the risks and costs associated with the divestment of GRAIL; (xiii) the risk of\nadditional litigation arising against us in connection with the GRAIL acquisition; (xiv) our ability to obtain approval by\nthird-party payors to reimburse patients for our products; (xv) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products\nfrom government agencies; (xvi) our ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop\nnew products, expand markets, and grow our business; (xvii) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions,\nincluding as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth or armed conflict; (xviii) the application of generally\naccepted accounting principles, which are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and\njudgments and (xix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, together with other factors detailed in our filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in\ninformation disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

We are making significant progress in:\n• Expanding margins and driving earnings;\n• Growing the utilization of the NovaSeq X platform; and\n• Bringing the next phase of sequencing innovation to our customers.\nIn Q3, revenue was $1.1 billion dollars, in line with our expectations.\nAcross our regions:\n• Americas revenue was down 6 percent year-over-year.\n• Europe revenue was up 12 percent.\n• AMEA revenue was up 7 percent and Greater China was down 23 percent.\nIn the quarter, we placed an additional 58 NovaSeq X Plus instruments, bringing our total installed base to 527.\nApproximately 40 percent of this installed base has been shipped to clinical customers, highlighting the diversity of our\nuser base. The X Series surpassed $1 billion dollars in cumulative revenue, a major milestone.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin of 22.6 percent and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, both exceeding our\nexpectations, and we began executing on the capital allocation strategy we laid out at our August Strategy Update.\nLooking ahead through year end, while the funnels remain healthy, the near-term macroeconomic environment has\nbeen persistently constrained. We now expect our 2024 revenue growth to be slightly lower than our prior guidance\nrange. However, we are raising our guidance for both 2024 operating margin and earnings per share, reflecting the\nsignificant progress we have made so far this year in our transformative journey, driving operational excellence and\nstrengthening our culture of performance. Ankur will provide additional details during his remarks.\nDuring our August Strategy Update, we laid out a plan to drive high-single digit revenue growth and 500 basis points of\noperating margin expansion by 2027, while achieving annual EPS growth in the double digits to teens over the next three\nyears. To achieve this, I have set key priorities to guide execution against our strategy: deeper customer collaboration,\ncontinuous innovation, and commitment to operational excellence and margin expansion.\nOur first priority, deeper customer collaboration, is centered on providing a range of targeted solutions to serve the\nincreasingly diverse needs of our customer base.\nOver the past several months, I’ve continued connecting with our customers worldwide. Most recently, this included a\ngroup of academic core lab directors that have a long legacy of collaboration with Illumina and are some of our most\nexperienced users. I am grateful to them for their ongoing partnership and support.\nAs we evolve the way we engage with customers, we are focused on two key initiatives:\n• One, shifting how we interact and collaborate with customers to support their ambitions. My observation was\nthat we needed to do better in this area. And now I’m beginning to hear from customers that they are seeing\nIllumina present itself in a new way.\n• And two, giving customers a clear line of sight to the significant innovations we have in the pipeline. Their early\ninput is invaluable, allowing us to develop the most impactful products and solutions in the industry.\nI’m pleased to see this partner mindset become increasingly embedded into our company’s culture. It will serve as a\ncornerstone of our success going forward.\nOur second priority is continuous innovation, which follows naturally from our first priority as it is driven and shaped by\nwhat customers are telling us they need.\nFor example, we recently announced the launch of the groundbreaking MiSeq i100. We are addressing demand for\nflexible solutions for smaller-scale projects with faster turnaround time. Early feedback is validating our approach of\nbringing customers into the fold as advisors throughout the product development process. Customers are excited about\nroom-temperature shipping and storage of reagents, allowing for sequencing on demand without the need to thaw\nreagents. The shorter run times, paired with 18 proven end-to-end workflows, are what our customers have been asking\nfor – and they have expressed that this is a gamechanger. Over time, we intend to leverage these new technologies in\nfuture releases across our portfolio.\nMiSeq i100 instruments for early access customers will begin shipping in late Q4, driven by the strong demand we saw in\nthe days following the announcement.\nAt our Strategy Update, we shared a number of additional innovations including comprehensive whole genome\nsequencing and our 5-base genome that will launch over the next 12 to 18 months. Collectively, these technologies will\nreinvent the genome while making NGS workflows easier.\nComprehensive whole genome solution leverages a novel constellation mapped read technology to add additional layers\nof genomic data, redefining the extent of information created by the SBS chemistry. Standard library prep is eliminated,\nas it is performed directly on the flow cell – going from multiple hours of hands-on time to just a few minutes.\nAnother customer-driven innovation is the 5-base genome, which will provide variant and epigenetic information from a\nsingle library prep. Customers will have access to methylation information in every run, which is important to\nunderstanding diseases, including cancer, obesity, and infectious diseases.\nBoth the 5-base genome and constellation mapped read technology solutions are currently in development, with\ncustomers providing feedback that will influence our product advancements. We will be providing further details on\nthese two innovations, including results from early access customers, at upcoming industry events like ASHG later this\nweek.\nIn the near-term, Illumina continues to deliver innovations for the NovaSeq X Series. We remain on track to begin\nshipping the single flow cell NovaSeq X by the end of this year. This instrument will be upgradeable to the NovaSeq X\nPlus. In Q4, we will introduce 100 cycle and 200 cycle 25B flow cells designed for high-output counting applications, such\nas single cell and proteomics.\nOur third priority is operational excellence. Our focus here is to build a foundation that powers our long-term success,\nregardless of the topline. By enhancing productivity, optimizing our investment spend, and driving smart capital\nallocation, we are positioning Illumina to directly benefit not only our customers and the patients they serve, but also\nour employees and our shareholders. Indeed, we have made great progress in building a culture where every employee\nis driving efficiencies to contribute to operational excellence.\nNow, I’ll ask Ankur to share more detail on our third quarter results and outlook.\nAnkur Dhingra, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jacob. And good afternoon, everyone.\nI will give you an overview of our financial results, provide more color about revenue, expenses, earnings, and\ndevelopments on our balance sheet, and then speak about our outlook going forward.\nAll financial information including guidance that we share on this call is for Core Illumina only, and excludes GRAIL.\nDuring the third quarter, Illumina’s revenue of $1.08 billion was in line with our expectations, and the team delivered a\nvery strong margin and earnings expansion through ongoing cost discipline and operational excellence. Cash generation\nremains strong and we also put cash to use across all dimensions of our capital allocation strategy.\nNow I will add color to each of these items:\nThird quarter revenue was down (2%) year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, with strong\ngrowth in our consumables business offset by the instruments business declining against launch-year compares.\nSequencing consumables revenue was $741 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued strong uptake in X\nconsumables.\nThe NovaSeq X transition progressed faster than we forecasted. As of end of Q3, more than 55% of high-throughput\ngigabases sequenced, and more than 35% of high-throughput consumables revenue, was on the NovaSeq X series. We\nsaw some acceleration of the transition from 6K to X this quarter – including in clinical as approximately 40% of high-\nthroughput clinical gigabases sequenced were on the NovaSeq X series. As legacy assays transition to the X series, we\nhave seen increased clinical volumes and increasing adoption of the 25B flow cell from clinical customers. While there\nwill be some quarterly variations in the pace of transition based on choices our customers make, we still believe almost\nhalf of high-throughput consumables revenue could transition to the X series by the middle of 2025.\nMoving to sequencing activity, total sequencing Gb output on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments\ncontinued to grow at a rate more than 40% year-over-year, with robust growth from both clinical and research\ncustomers.\nSequencing instruments revenue was $104 million for Q3, a (42%) year-over-year decline, slightly behind our\nexpectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by two factors:\n• One, lower NovaSeq X placements, as compared to significant pre-order launch-related shipments in the third\nquarter of 2023, and\n• Two, a decline in mid-throughput shipments, as capital and cashflow constraints continue to impact purchasing\nbehavior and moderate instrument placements globally.\nSequencing service and other revenue was $150 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by an increase in revenue from\nstrategic partnerships as well as high instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L:\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% for the quarter increased 450 basis points year-over-year. This strong gross margin\nperformance was driven primarily by the execution of our operational excellence initiatives that continue to improve\nproductivity and deliver cost savings. Year-over-year improvement in gross margin was also supported by a more\nfavorable revenue mix of sequencing consumables - making up roughly half of that improvement. While the business\nmix will change on quarter to quarter basis, the productivity improvements we have achieved are sustainable and will\nsupport our margin expansion going forward.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses of $517 million were roughly flat to last quarter. This includes the additional headcount\nand expenses resulting from our acquisition of Fluent BioSciences. The Illumina team continues to manage expenses\neffectively. As I mentioned during our Strategy Update, we have several actions in play to reprioritize and reduce our\nexpenses.\nAs a result, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.6%, compared to 22.5% in the prior year period. This\ncame in well above our guidance of approximately 20%, driven by strong operational performance across gross margin\nand discipline in expenses.\nBelow the operating income line, non-GAAP other expense was ($14) million in Q3. During the quarter, we issued $500\nmillion in debt at a 4.65% coupon that was used, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full the high cost $750 million\ndelayed draw term loan, effectively de-levering and also reducing our interest rate.\nNon-GAAP tax rate was 21.0% for the quarter. In Q3, we received the benefit of a few one-time credits as we filed our\nreturn for last year.\nPutting it all together, non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $181 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.14 per diluted\nshare. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 160 million shares.\nMoving to cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter:\n• Cash flow provided by operations was healthy at $316 million;\n• Capital expenditures were $32 million and free cash flow was $284 million.\nDuring the quarter, we put cash to work in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. We acquired Fluent\nBiosciences – adding innovative instrument-free single-cell technology to Illumina’s portfolio. We are excited about the\npotential for very-large single cell experiments this technology can enable.\nIn addition, following authorization from our Board earlier this quarter, we put a share repurchase program in place, and\nrepurchased 770 thousand shares of Illumina stock for $98M, at an average price of $127.71 per share. And as noted, we\nde-levered. Taken together, these capital actions show the strength of our operational execution in the quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $939 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nIn summary, revenue was in line with expectations; the transition of high-throughput sequencing to the NovaSeq X is\ngoing quite well; we announced breakthrough new products in low throughput; we made significant progress towards\nour stated goal of margin expansion; and we have been deploying our strong cash flow towards revenue growth,\nimproved earnings, and shareholder-friendly capital actions.\nMoving now to 2024 guidance:\nAlthough our overall Q3 revenue results met our expectations, we are tempering our revenue expectations for year-end\nbusiness – and now expect full-year revenue to be down approximately 3%. For Q4, we expect revenue to be\napproximately $1.07 billion. We continue to see strong utilization levels and pull-through on our instruments but the\nnear-term macroeconomic environment remains constrained and does not support any uptick in purchasing behavior\nthrough the end of the year.\nFrom an instruments versus consumables perspective, the projected mix is unchanged and we are still forecasting\ninstruments revenue to decline in the mid-thirties % range relative to 2023. Although we are very excited about MiSeq\ni100, it is in early access, and we will receive minimal revenue contribution in Q4. As we had planned for, our low\nthroughput instruments business will likely decline in Q4 with customers waiting for the new instrument. For high-\nthroughput, we still expect second half NovaSeq X shipments to be above what we delivered in the first half of 2024.\nWe also still forecast sequencing consumables revenue to grow towards the upper end of the low single-digit\npercentage range versus 2023. We saw strong uptake and Gb usage in the third quarter, setting the stage for exiting the\nyear with solid year-over-year consumables growth.\nWhile we are disappointed in our lower revenue guidance, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin and\ndiluted EPS – reflecting both the outperformance in Q3 and carrying forward the impact of our operational excellence\ninitiatives into Q4. We are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a range of 21% - 21.5% for 2024. We are\nreducing our projected tax rate for the year to approximately 24%. And lastly, we are raising our guidance range for non-\nGAAP diluted earnings per share to $4.05 to $4.15 range for full year 2024.\nWith that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Ankur.\nAs I reflect on my first year, I am excited for the early progress Illumina has made and the momentum we have created\nto drive the industry forward. We refocused the company on our strong core business and launched our new strategy.\nWe reset the leadership team and made the necessary structural changes to support our customer-first orientation. We\nhave been increasingly embedding operational excellence in our culture, and the results are beginning to show in our\nfinancials. This is a good start to our multi-year transformation journey. For 2025, we are looking forward to returning to\ngrowth, although I would like to finish Q4 before providing specific guidance.\nUltimately, I am encouraged and I feel confident in bringing Illumina back to high single digit revenue growth by 2027 as\nstated during our Strategy Update.\nThank you for joining today. I’ll now invite the Operator to open the line for Q&A.\nStatement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe company reports non-GAAP results for diluted earnings per share, net income, gross margin, operating expenses,\nincluding research and development expense, selling general and administrative expense, legal contingencies and\nsettlement, and goodwill and intangible impairment, operating income, operating margin, gross profit, other income\n(expense), tax provision, constant currency revenue growth, and free cash flow (on a consolidated and, as applicable,\nsegment basis) in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. The company’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of\nacquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the\neffects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating\nperformance. Non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share and operating margin are key components of the\nfinancial metrics utilized by the company’s board of directors to measure, in part, management’s performance and\ndetermine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP\ninformation and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\nThe company provides forward-looking guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The company is unable to provide a\nreconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial\nmeasures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of items such as acquisition-related\nexpenses, gains and losses from strategic investments, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, potential\nfuture asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without unreasonable\neffort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could have a material\nimpact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the\nsignificance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\nUse of forward-looking statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to\nwhich our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking\nstatements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of customer\norders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our revenue\nexpectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of products and\nservices competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products\nand services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical\ncomponents; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and\nservices; (viii) our ability to modify our business strategies to accomplish our desired operational goals; (ix) our ability to\nrealize the anticipated benefits from prior or future actions to streamline and improve our R&D processes, reduce our\noperating expenses and maximize our revenue growth; (x) our ability to further develop and commercialize our\ninstruments, consumables, and products; (xi) to deploy new products, services, and applications, and to expand the\nmarkets for our technology platforms; (xii) the risks and costs associated with the divestment of GRAIL; (xiii) the risk of\nadditional litigation arising against us in connection with the GRAIL acquisition; (xiv) our ability to obtain approval by\nthird-party payors to reimburse patients for our products; (xv) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products\nfrom government agencies; (xvi) our ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop\nnew products, expand markets, and grow our business; (xvii) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions,\nincluding as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth or armed conflict; (xviii) the application of generally\naccepted accounting principles, which are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and\njudgments and (xix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, together with other factors detailed in our filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in\ninformation disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

Words such as: “anticipate,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “continue,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “potential,” “predict,”\n“should,” “will,” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these\nwords does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others,\nstatements we make regarding:\n• our expectations as to our future financial performance, results of operations, or other operational results or metrics;\n• the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and certain transactions we have completed, or may complete, such\nas product introductions, increased revenue, decreased expenses, and avoided expenses and expenditures;\n• our expectations of the effect on our financial condition of claims, litigation, contingent liabilities, and governmental investigations,\nproceedings, and regulations;\n• our strategies or expectations for product development, market position, financial results, and reserves;\n• our ability to successfully implement cost reduction plans in a timely manner and the possibility that costs associated with our cost\nreduction plans are greater than we anticipate;\n• risks relating to the recent divestiture of GRAIL, Inc. (f/k/a GRAIL, LLC) (GRAIL); and\n• other expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, anticipated developments, and other matters that are not historical facts.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current\nbeliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and\ntrends, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent\nuncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results\nand financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of\nthese forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those\nindicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n• our expectations and beliefs regarding prospects and growth for our business and the markets in which we operate;\n• the timing and mix of customer orders among our products and services;\n• challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products and services, including expanding manufacturing\noperations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical components;\n• the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and services;\n• risks and uncertainties regarding legal and regulatory proceedings;\n• risks associated with contracts or other agreements containing provisions that might be implicated by the divestiture of GRAIL,\nincluding our ability to fully realize the anticipated economic benefits of our commercial arrangements with GRAIL and our obligations\nwith respect to contingent value rights (the CVRs) issued by us in connection with the GRAIL acquisition, which may adversely affect us\nand our business and/or the market value of the CVRs;\n• the risk of additional litigation arising against us in connection with the GRAIL acquisition;\n• the assumptions underlying our critical accounting policies and estimates;\n3\nTable of Contents\n• our assessments and estimates that determine our effective tax rate;\n• our assessments and beliefs regarding the outcome of pending legal proceedings and any liability that we may incur as a result of\nthose proceedings, as well as the cost and potential diversion of management resources associated with these proceedings;\n• uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions, including as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth, public health\ncrisis, or armed conflict; and\n• other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions described in “Risk Factors” within the Business & Market Information section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the “Other Key Information” section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended\nMarch 31, 2024, and on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, the “Risk Factors” section below, or in information disclosed in\npublic conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is based only on information currently available to us and\nspeaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to publicly update any forward-looking statement,\nwhether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, or to review or confirm analysts’ expectations, or to provide interim reports or\nupdates on the progress of any current financial quarter, in each case whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\n4\nTable of Contents\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nILLUMINA, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\nSeptember 29, December 31,\n2024

requires otherwise, references in this report to “Illumina,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Illumina, Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.\n1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a provider of sequencing- and array-based solutions for genetic and genomic analysis, serving customers in the research, clinical and\napplied markets. Our products are used for applications in the life sciences, oncology, reproductive health, agriculture and other emerging\nsegments. Our customers include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and hospitals, as well as\npharmaceutical, biotechnology, commercial molecular diagnostic laboratories, and consumer genomics companies.\nOn June 24, 2024, we completed the separation (the Spin-Off) of GRAIL into a new public company through the distribution of 26,547,021\nshares of GRAIL common stock to Illumina stockholders on a pro rata basis. The distribution reflected approximately 85.5% of the outstanding\ncommon stock of GRAIL as of 5:00 p.m. New York time on June 13, 2024, the record date for the distribution (the Record Date). We retained\napproximately 14.5% of the shares of GRAIL common stock immediately following the Spin-Off. The disposition of GRAIL did not meet the\ncriteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and accordingly, GRAIL’s assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows have not\nbeen reclassified. Refer to note 2. GRAIL Spin-Off for additional details.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,\nthey do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Interim financial results are not\nnecessarily indicative of results anticipated for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023, from which the prior year balance sheet information herein was derived. The preparation of financial statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense, and\nrelated disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Though macroeconomic factors such as inflation, exchange rate fluctuations and concerns\nabout an economic downturn present additional uncertainty, we continue to use the best information available to form our critical accounting\nestimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and majority-owned or\ncontrolled companies. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In management’s opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the\nresults for the interim periods presented.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to\nMarch 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. References to Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 refer to the three months ended September 29,\n2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, which were both 13 weeks, and references to year-to-date (YTD) 2024 and 2023 refer to the nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, which were both 39 weeks.\n11\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nDuring YTD 2024, there were no changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nAccounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The\nnew standard requires a company to disclose incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, including significant segment\nexpenses and measures of profit or loss that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The standard is effective for\nus beginning in fiscal year 2024 and interim periods within fiscal year 2025, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect to early adopt the\nnew standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and will\nadopt the new standard using a retrospective approach.\nIn December 2023, the FASB also issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new\nstandard requires a company to expand its existing income tax disclosures, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.\nThe standard is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2025, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect to early adopt the new standard.\nThe new standard is expected to be applied prospectively, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of\nASU 2023-09 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\nearnings (loss) per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common\nshares outstanding during the period. In loss periods, basic and diluted loss per share are identical since the effect of potentially dilutive common\nshares is antidilutive and therefore excluded. Potentially dilutive common shares from equity awards are determined using the average share\nprice for each period under the treasury stock method. In addition, proceeds from exercise of equity awards and the average amount of\nunrecognized compensation expense for equity awards are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nThe weighted average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share were as follows:\nIn millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nWeighted average shares outstanding 159 158 159 158\nEffect of potentially dilutive common shares from:\nEquity awards 1 — — —\nWeighted average shares used in calculating diluted earnings\n(loss) per share 160 158 159 158\nAntidilutive shares:\nEquity awards 2 3 4 3\nConvertible senior notes — 1 — 1\nPotentially dilutive shares excluded from calculation due to\nantidilutive effect 2 4 4 4\n12\nTable of Contents\n2. GRAIL SPIN-OFF\nOn June 24, 2024, we completed the Spin-Off of GRAIL into a separate, independent publicly traded company through the distribution of\n26,547,021 shares of GRAIL common stock to Illumina stockholders on a pro rata basis. The GRAIL common stock distributed in the Spin-Off\nconsisted of approximately 85.5% of the outstanding common stock of GRAIL as of the Record Date. The Spin-Off was structured as a tax-free\nspin-off and Illumina stockholders received one share of GRAIL common stock for every six shares of Illumina common stock held on the Record\nDate. We retained approximately 14.5% of the shares of GRAIL common stock immediately following the Spin-Off. The disposition of GRAIL did\nnot meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and accordingly, GRAIL’s assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows\nhave not been reclassified.\nAs part of the Spin-Off, we contributed to GRAIL an amount, in cash, to cover 2.5 years of GRAIL’s operations (the Disposal Funding), which\nwas determined to be $974 million, less the cash and cash equivalents held by GRAIL.\nThe carrying amounts of GRAIL’s assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group were as follows:\nIn millions\nCash and cash equivalents $ 968\nAccounts receivable, net 13\nInventory, net 22\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 27\nProperty and equipment, net 80\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 74\nIntangible assets, net 2,201\nOther assets 14\nAccounts payable (12)\nAccrued liabilities (118)\nOperating lease liabilities (62)\nOther long term-liabilities (469)\nGRAIL net assets $ 2,738\nAmount of GRAIL net assets recorded to short-term investments $ 397\nAmount of GRAIL net assets recorded to additional paid-in capital $ 2,341\nAdditional adjustments recorded to additional paid-in capital as a result of the GRAIL Spin-Off:\nNon-contingent indemnification liability (see Note 6) 1\nTax adjustment for difference between the book and tax values of our retained investment in GRAIL 57\nTotal recorded to additional paid-in capital as a result of the GRAIL Spin-Off $ 2,399\nSee note 10. Segment Information for GRAIL’s results of operations, prior to the Spin-Off, included in our condensed consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented within.\nIn planning for and executing the Spin-Off, we incurred $53 million in separation-related transaction costs during YTD 2024, which were\nrecognized in selling, general, and administrative expense. These transaction costs primarily related to financial advisory, legal, regulatory and\nother professional services fees directly related to the Spin-Off.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, Illumina and GRAIL entered into various agreements to effect the Spin-Off and provide a framework for GRAIL’s\nrelationship with Illumina after the Spin-Off, including a separation and distribution agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters\nagreement, an amended supply and commercialization agreement and a stockholder’s and registration rights agreement (the Agreements). The\nAgreements determine the treatment of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including certain tax-related assets and liabilities) of\nIllumina attributable to periods prior to, at and after GRAIL’s separation and also govern certain relationships between Illumina and GRAIL after\nthe Spin-Off.\n13\nTable of Contents\n3. REVENUE\nOur revenue is generated from the sale of products and services. Product revenue consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in\ngenetic analysis. Service and other revenue consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services, instrument service\ncontracts, development and licensing agreements, and, prior to the Spin-Off of GRAIL on June 24, 2024, cancer detection testing services\nrelated to the GRAIL business.\nRevenue by Source\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023\nIn millions Sequencing Microarray Total Sequencing Microarray Total\nConsumables $ 741 $ 66 $ 807 $ 689 $ 71 $ 760\nInstruments 104 3 107 178 3 181\nTotal product revenue 845 69 914 867 74 941\nService and other revenue 150 16 166 162 16 178\nTotal revenue $ 995 $ 85 $ 1,080 $ 1,029 $ 90 $ 1,119\nYTD 2024 YTD 2023\nIn millions Sequencing Microarray Total Sequencing Microarray Total\nConsumables $ 2,160 $ 216 $ 2,376 $ 2,108 $ 219 $ 2,327\nInstruments 330 12 342 524 13 537\nTotal product revenue 2,490 228 2,718 2,632 232 2,864\nService and other revenue 499 51 550 456 62 518\nTotal revenue $ 2,989 $ 279 $ 3,268 $ 3,088 $ 294 $ 3,382\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nBased on region of destination (in millions) Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nAmericas $ 609 $ 663 $ 1,852 $ 1,920\nEurope 291 260 859 825\nGreater China (1) 75 98 228 302\nAsia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (2) 105 98 329 335\nTotal revenue $ 1,080 $ 1,119 $ 3,268 $ 3,382\n_____________\n(1) Region includes revenue from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\n(2) Region includes revenue from Russia and Turkey.\nPerformance Obligations\nWe regularly enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations. These contracts are believed to be firm as of the balance sheet date.\nHowever, we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products. The timing of shipments depends on several\nfactors, including agreed upon shipping schedules, which may span multiple quarters. Most performance obligations are generally satisfied\nwithin a short time frame, approximately three to six months, after the contract execution date. As of September 29, 2024, the aggregate amount\nof the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $688 million, of which approximately 82% is expected to be\nconverted to revenue in the next twelve months, approximately 13% in the following twelve months, and the remainder thereafter.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets, which consist of revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing,\nwere $16 million and $18 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were recorded in prepaid expenses and\nother current assets.\n14\nTable of Contents\nContract liabilities, which consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits, as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were $293\nmillion and $329 million, respectively, of which $235 million and $252 million, respectively, was short-term and recorded in accrued liabilities and\nthe remaining long-term portions were recorded in other long-term liabilities. Revenue recorded in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 included $48 million\nand $213 million, respectively, of previously deferred revenue that was included in contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n4. INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nStrategic Investments\nMarketable Equity Securities\nOur short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our\nmarketable equity securities totaled $70 million and $6 million, respectively. The increase in our marketable equity securities relates to the\ninvestment we retained in GRAIL subsequent to the Spin-Off, which was initially recorded as $397 million, representing 14.5% of GRAIL’s net\nassets disposed of at Spin-Off. Refer to note 2. GRAIL Spin-Off for details. We recorded an unrealized loss of $332 million in YTD 2024,\nsubsequent to the Spin-Off, based on the fair value of our investment in GRAIL as of September 29, 2024.\nGains and (losses) recognized in other income (expense), net on marketable equity securities were as follows:\nIn millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nNet losses recognized during the period on marketable equity securities $ (4) $ — $ (333) $ (2)\nLess: Net losses recognized during the period on marketable equity\nsecurities sold during the period — — — (2)\nNet unrealized losses recognized during the period on marketable\nequity securities still held at the reporting date $ (4) $ — $ (333) $ —\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nAs of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of non-marketable equity securities, without readily\ndeterminable fair values, included in other assets, was $27 million and $28 million, respectively.\nVenture Funds\nWe invest in three venture capital investment funds (the Funds), which are accounted for as equity-method investments. The aggregate\ncarrying amount of the Funds, included in other assets, was $191 million and $168 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. We recorded losses of $6 million and $3 million in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively, and losses of $19 million and $33\nmillion in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively, in other income (expense), net. Our commitments to the Funds are as follows:\nRemaining callable as of\n$ in millions Capital commitments Callable through date September 29, 2024(1)\nFund I $ 100 April 2026 $ 3\nFund II $ 150 July 2029 $ 49\nFund III $ 60 December 2034 $ 47\n_____________\n(1) Fund I also had recallable distributions of approximately $10 million.\nRevenue recognized from transactions with our strategic investees was $7 million and $13 million for Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively, and\n$2 million and $68 million for Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIn millions Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds (cash\nequivalents) $ 674 $ — $ — $ 674 $ 774 $ — $ — $ 774\nMarketable equity securities 70 — — 70 6 — — 6\nHelix contingent value right — — — — — — 68 68\nDeferred compensation plan\nassets — 70 — 70 — 61 — 61\nTotal assets measured at fair\nvalue $ 744 $ 70 $ — $ 814 $ 780 $ 61 $ 68 $ 909\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration\nliabilities $ — $ — $ 84 $ 84 $ — $ — $ 387 $ 387\nDeferred compensation plan\nliability — 64 — 64 — 59 — 59\nTotal liabilities measured at fair\nvalue $ — $ 64 $ 84 $ 148 $ — $ 59 $ 387 $ 446\nOur marketable equity securities are measured at fair value based on quoted trade prices in active markets. Our deferred compensation plan\nassets consist primarily of investments in life insurance contracts carried at cash surrender value, which reflects the net asset value of the\nunderlying publicly traded mutual funds. We perform control procedures to corroborate the fair value of our holdings, including comparing\nvaluations obtained from our investment service provider to valuations reported by our asset custodians, validating pricing sources and models,\nand reviewing key model inputs, if necessary.\nHelix Contingent Value Right\nIn conjunction with the deconsolidation of Helix Holdings I, LLC (Helix) in April 2019, we received a contingent value right with a 7-year term that\nentitled us to consideration dependent upon the outcome of Helix’s future financing and/or liquidity events. We elected the fair value option to\nmeasure the contingent value right received from Helix. Changes in the estimated fair value are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nHistorically, we estimated the fair value of the contingent value right using a Monte Carlo simulation. Estimates and assumptions used in the\nMonte Carlo simulation included probabilities related to the timing and outcome of future financing and/or liquidity events, assumptions regarding\ncollectability and volatility, and an estimated equity value of Helix. These unobservable inputs represented a Level 3 measurement because they\nare supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value. On July 31, 2024, we received cash of\n$83 million to settle the contingent value right early. Changes in the Helix contingent value right during YTD 2024 were as follows:\nIn millions\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 (included in other assets) $ 68\nChange in estimated fair value 15\nCash received to settle (83)\nBalance as of September 29, 2024 $ —\n16\nTable of Contents\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe reassess the fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions on a quarterly basis, with changes in the fair value, subsequent to\nthe acquisition date, recognized in selling, general and administrative expense. The contingent value rights issued as part of the GRAIL\nacquisition entitle the holders to receive future cash payments on a quarterly basis (Covered Revenue Payments) representing a pro rata portion\nof certain GRAIL-related revenues (Covered Revenues) each year for a 12-year period (through August 2033). As defined in the Contingent\nValue Rights Agreement, this will reflect a 2.5% payment right to the first $1 billion of revenue each year for 12 years. Revenue above $1 billion\neach year will be subject to a 9% contingent payment right during this same period. Covered Revenues for the period Q4 2023 through Q2 2024\nwere $89 million in aggregate and for the period Q4 2022 through Q2 2023 were $65 million in aggregate, driven primarily by sales of GRAIL’s\nGalleri test. Covered Revenue Payments relating to such periods were $836,000 and $609,000 in YTD 2024 and YTD 2023, respectively.\nThe fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to GRAIL was $82 million and $387 million as of September 29, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, of which $81 million and $385 million, respectively, was included in other long-term liabilities, with the\nremaining balances included in accrued liabilities. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of the GRAIL contingent\nconsideration liability. Estimates and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation include forecasted revenues for GRAIL, a revenue risk\npremium, a revenue volatility estimate, an operational leverage ratio and a counterparty credit spread. These unobservable inputs represent a\nLevel 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value.\nSubsequent to the Spin-Off of GRAIL, we no longer have access to GRAIL management’s forecasts and therefore must rely on information\nmade public by GRAIL’s management to estimate forecasted revenues through August 2033. In August 2024, GRAIL management publicly\nannounced a corporate restructure, including a reduction in headcount and planned hires and a substantial decrease in certain R&D projects and\ninvestments. To estimate the liability as of September 29, 2024, we selected a revenue risk premium of 18%, which was derived from reconciling\nour forecasted revenues for GRAIL to GRAIL’s market capitalization based on a 60-day trailing average. The significant decrease in the\ncontingent consideration liability from December 31, 2023 was due to the decrease in the forecasted revenues, following revised revenue\nprojections announced by GRAIL in May 2024 and the restructuring announcement in August 2024, and the increase in the revenue risk\npremium resulting from the lower market capitalization observed at or subsequent to the Spin-Off.\nThe assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to GRAIL are inherently subject to uncertainty\nand we note that small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value. For example, an increase or\ndecrease of 20%, in each year, to the forecasted revenues would have resulted in an increase of $21 million and a decrease of $20 million,\nrespectively, in the liability as of September 29, 2024. Additionally, an increase or decrease of 250 basis points to the selected revenue risk\npremium would have resulted in a decrease of $15 million and an increase of $16 million, respectively. We expect certain levels of volatility in the\nGRAIL contingent consideration liability are possible in future quarters.\nChanges in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities during YTD 2024 were as follows:\nIn millions\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 387\nAcquisition 2\nChange in estimated fair value (304)\nCash payments (1)\nBalance as of September 29, 2024 $ 84\n17\nTable of Contents\n5.

After deducting discounts and issuance costs,\nwe received net proceeds of $497 million, which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt under the Delayed Draw Credit\nAgreement. The 2026 Term Notes, which mature on September 9, 2026, accrue interest at a rate of 4.650% per annum, payable semi-annually\non March 9 and September 9 of each year, beginning on March 9, 2025. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Term Notes, at\nour option, at any time prior to maturity at make-whole premium redemption prices as defined in the form of the notes.\n5.800% Term Notes due 2025 (2025 Term Notes) and 5.750% Term Notes due 2027 (2027 Term Notes)\nIn December 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Term Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2027\nTerm Notes. The 2025 Notes, which mature on December 12, 2025, and the 2027 Notes, which mature on December 13, 2027, accrue interest\nat a rate of 5.800% and 5.750% per annum, respectively, payable semi-annually. Interest for the 2025 Notes is payable on June 12 and\nDecember 12 of each year and interest for the 2027 Notes is payable on June 13 and December 13 of each year, beginning in June 2023.\nWe may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 or 2027 Term Notes, at our option, at any time prior to maturity. Prior to November 12,\n2025 for the 2025 Notes and prior to November 13, 2027 for the 2027 Notes, the notes are redeemable at make-whole premium redemption\nprices as defined in the applicable forms of note. After November 12, 2025 and November 13, 2027, respectively, the notes are redeemable at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n2.550% Term Notes due 2031 (2031 Term Notes)\nIn March 2021, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2031 Term Notes. The notes mature on March 23, 2031 and accrue\ninterest at a rate of 2.550% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 23 and September 23 of each year. We may redeem for cash all or any\nportion of the notes, at our option, at any time prior to maturity. Prior to December 23, 2030, the notes are redeemable at make-whole premium\nredemption prices as defined in the form of the notes. After December 23, 2030, the notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100%\nof the principal to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n18\nTable of Contents\nDelayed Draw Term Loan due 2025\nOn June 17, 2024, we entered into a 364-day delayed draw credit agreement (the Delayed Draw Credit Agreement), which provided us with a\nsenior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750 million (the Delayed Draw Credit Facility). On June 20,\n2024, we borrowed $750 million on the credit facility in order to provide a portion of the Disposal Funding to GRAIL as part of the Spin-Off. The\ndelayed draw term loan incurred interest at a rate of 6.7%. On September 9, 2024, we repaid the full principal outstanding on the Delayed Draw\nCredit Facility, including accrued interest, of $761 million and terminated the Delayed Draw Credit Agreement. We recognized a loss on debt\nextinguishment of $5 million in Q3 2024 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which was included in interest expense in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn January 4, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement), which provides us with a $750 million senior\nunsecured five-year revolving credit facility, including a $40 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit\n(the Revolving Credit Facility). Proceeds of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding become due and payable in full, on January 4, 2028, subject to two one-year\nextensions at our option, the consent of the extending lenders and certain other conditions. We may prepay amounts borrowed and terminate\ncommitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty. As of September 29, 2024, there were no borrowings or\nletters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Facility will have a variable interest rate based on either the term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) or\nthe alternate base rate, plus an applicable rate that varies with our debt rating and, in the case of loans bearing interest based on term SOFR, a\ncredit spread adjustment equal to 0.10% per annum. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes an option for us to elect to increase commitments\nunder the credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million, subject to\nconsent of the lenders providing the additional commitments or loans and certain other conditions.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial and operating covenants. Pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement, we are required to\nmaintain a ratio of total debt to adjusted annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), calculated based on the\nfour consecutive fiscal quarters ending with the most recent fiscal quarter, of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter.\nUpon the consummation of any Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) and us providing notice to the Administrative\nAgent, the ratio increases to 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition is consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters\nthereafter. The operating covenants include, among other things, limitations on (i) the incurrence of indebtedness by our subsidiaries, (ii) liens on\nour and our subsidiaries assets, and (iii) certain fundamental changes and the disposition of assets by us and our subsidiaries. The Credit\nAgreement contains other customary covenants, representations and warranties, and events of default.\n6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nAs of September 29, 2024, approximately 5.4 million shares remained available for future grants under the Amended and Restated 2015 Stock\nand Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2015 Plan). In connection with the GRAIL Spin-Off, all unvested RSU and PSU were equitably adjusted\npursuant to the plan to preserve their intrinsic value and the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan was increased by\n160,000 shares.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock activity was as follows:\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair\nRestricted Performance\nValue per Share\nStock Units Stock Units\nUnits in thousands (RSU) (PSU)(1) RSU PSU\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 2,198 — $ 236.32 $ —\nAwarded 2,753 647 $ 133.60 $ 159.36\nUnvested adjustment for GRAIL Spin-Off 107 12 $ — $ —\nVested (83) — $ 258.43 $ —\nCancelled (352) (39) $ 201.11 $ 167.68\nOutstanding at September 29, 2024 4,623 620 $ 172.30 $ 159.72\n_____________\n(1) We issue PSU for which the number of shares issuable is based on our performance relative to specified earnings per share targets (EPS PSU) and PSU with a market\ncondition that vest based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return as compared to a peer group of companies (rTSR PSU). In Q1 2024, we began to issue PSU for\nwhich the number of shares issuable is based on our performance relative to specified operating margin targets (OM PSU).

In connection with the GRAIL Spin-Off, all\noutstanding performance stock options were assumed by GRAIL.\nLiability-Classified Awards\nPrior to the GRAIL Spin-Off, we granted cash-based equity incentive awards to GRAIL employees, which were accounted for as liability-\nclassified awards. In connection with the Spin-Off, these awards were assumed by GRAIL.\nCash-based equity incentive award activity was as follows:\nIn millions\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 $ 292\nGranted 67\nVested and paid in cash (54)\nCancelled (13)\nChange in fair value (9)\nDerecognition for GRAIL Spin-Off(1) (283)\nOutstanding at September 29, 2024 $ —\n_____________\n(1) The estimated liability immediately prior to the Spin-Off, recorded in accrued liabilities, was $53 million, which was disposed of as part of GRAIL’s net assets. See note 2.\nGRAIL Spin-Off for additional details.\nWe recognized share-based compensation expense on these cash-based equity incentive awards of $52 million in YTD 2024, prior to the Spin-\nOff, and $26 million and $72 million in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively.\n20\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the acquisition of GRAIL, we assumed a performance-based award for which vesting was based on GRAIL’s future revenues\nand had an aggregate potential value of up to $78 million. Prior to the GRAIL Spin-Off, it was not probable that the performance conditions\nassociated with the award would be achieved and, therefore, no share-based compensation expense was recognized in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. In connection with the Spin-Off, this award was assumed by GRAIL. For a period of 2.5 years following\nthe Spin-Off, we are obligated to indemnify GRAIL for cash payments that become earned and payable related to this award. The indemnification\nis accounted for in accordance with ASC 460. As of September 29, 2024, we recognized a non-contingent liability of $1 million for this\nindemnification, with a corresponding charge to additional paid-in capital.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\nThe price at which common stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of\nthe offering period or purchase date, whichever is lower. During YTD 2024, approximately 0.5 million shares were issued under the plan. As of\nSeptember 29, 2024, there were approximately 12.4 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP, which reflects an upward adjustment\nof approximately 0.5 million shares pursuant to the terms of the plan to account for the GRAIL Spin-Off.\nThe assumptions used and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share for stock purchased under the ESPP during YTD\n2024 were as follows:\nRisk-free interest rate 4.35% - 5.54%\nExpected volatility 41% - 49%\nExpected term 0.5 - 1.1 year\nExpected dividends 0 %\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 37.24\nShare Repurchases\nIn August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, which cancels and supersedes all prior and available\nrepurchase authorizations, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock. The repurchases may be completed through open\nmarket purchases, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18, or through an accelerated share repurchase program. Authorizations to repurchase\nup to $1.4 billion of our outstanding common stock remained available as of September 29, 2024.\nShare repurchase activity during Q3 2024 was as follows:\nIn millions, except shares in thousands\nNumber of shares repurchased 770\nTotal cost of shares repurchased(1) $ 99\n_____________\n(1) Total cost of shares repurchased includes the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which is calculated based on share repurchases, net of\ncertain share issuances, and was immaterial for Q3 2024.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense, which includes expense for both equity and liability-classified awards, reported in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations was as follows:\n21\nTable of Contents\nIn millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nCost of product revenue $ 7 $ 7 $ 19 $ 22\nCost of service and other revenue 1 2 5 5\nResearch and development 33 36 115 117\nSelling, general and administrative 43 41 152 142\nShare-based compensation expense, before taxes 84 86 291 286\nRelated income tax benefits (18) (19) (66) (65)\nShare-based compensation expense, net of taxes $ 66 $ 67 $ 225 $ 221\nAs of September 29, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost, related to restricted stock and ESPP shares issued to date, of $655 million was\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.\n7.

Additionally, we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date,\nwhich generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date. At the time revenue is recognized, an accrual is established for\nestimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance. We periodically review the warranty\nreserve for adequacy and adjust the warranty accrual, if necessary, based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred. Warranty\nexpense is recorded as a component of cost of product revenue.\nRestructuring\nIn Q2 2023, we implemented a cost reduction initiative that included workforce reductions, the consolidation of certain facilities and other actions\nto reduce expenses, all as part of a plan to realign operating expenses while maintaining focus on our innovation roadmap and sustainable long-\nterm growth. In YTD 2024, we recorded restructuring charges primarily consisting of asset impairment charges related to our leased facilities.\nA summary of the pre-tax restructuring charges are as follows:\nCumulative charges\nrecorded since\nIn millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023 inception\nEmployee separation costs $ 6 $ 7 $ 13 $ 33 $ 61\nAsset impairment charges(1) — 49 32 56 132\nOther costs — 2 1 2 5\nTotal restructuring charges(2) $ 6 $ 58 $ 46 $ 91 $ 198\n_____________\n(1) For YTD 2024, charges primarily relate to impairment of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements for our Foster City campus.\nFor YTD 2023, charges primarily relate to impairment of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements for our i3 campus.\n(2) For Q3 2024, $5 million was recorded in SG&A expense and $1 million in R&D expense.\nFor YTD 2024, $43 million was recorded in SG&A expense, $2 million in R&D expense, and remainder in cost of revenue.\nFor Q3 2023, $55 million was recorded in SG&A expense, $2 million in R&D expense, and remainder in cost of revenue.\nFor YTD 2023, $74 million was recorded in SG&A expense, $13 million in R&D expense, and remainder in cost of revenue.\nWe recorded right-of-use asset impairments of $18 million in Q1 2024 related to our campus in Foster City, California and another property in\nSan Diego, California. The impairments, which were recognized in selling, general and administrative expense, were determined by comparing\nthe fair values of the impacted right-of-use assets to the carrying values of the assets as of the impairment measurement date. The fair values of\nthe right-of-use assets were estimated using the discounted future cash flows method, which includes estimates and assumptions for future\nsublease rental rates that reflect current sublease market conditions, as well as discount rates. The estimates and assumptions used in our\nassessments represent Level 3 measurements because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in\nmeasuring fair value. We also recorded $14 million of leasehold improvement impairments in Q1 2024, related to our Foster City campus,\nrecognized in selling, general and administrative expense. We continue to evaluate our options with respect to the rest of our campus in Foster\nCity, California and the other property in San Diego, California. As of September 29, 2024, we had remaining assets, consisting primarily of right-\nof-use assets and leasehold improvements, related to our Foster City campus and the other property in San Diego, California of approximately\n$136 million.\n23\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the restructuring liability is as follows:\nIn millions Employee Separation Costs(1) Other Costs Total\nAmount recorded in accrued liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 17 $ 1 $ 18\nAdditional expense recorded 13 1 14\nCash payments (22) (2) (24)\nAdjustments to accrual (2) — (2)\nAmount recorded in accrued liabilities as of\nSeptember 29, 2024 $ 6 $ — $ 6\n_____________\n(1) It is expected that substantially all of the employee separation related charges will be paid by the end of Q4 2024.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the\npotential for impairment. In May 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for our two reporting units: Core Illumina and GRAIL.\nWe performed a quantitative test for both reporting units. GRAIL’s carrying value exceeded its fair value, estimated as $580 million, and we\nrecorded a goodwill impairment of $1,466 million in Q2 2024. There was no impairment for Core Illumina, as its fair value exceeded its carrying\nvalue.\nTo determine the fair value of GRAIL as of May 2024, we utilized enterprise value estimates of GRAIL, as estimated by investment bankers for\npurposes of determining pricing for the Spin-Off. Estimates and assumptions used to derive the investment bankers’ enterprise value estimates\nincluded estimated revenues for a two year period based on assumed growth rates and implied revenue multiples for comparable companies.\nThese estimates and assumptions represent a Level 3 measurement as they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own\nassumptions in measuring fair value. An increase in estimated enterprise values for GRAIL of 100% would still have resulted in a full impairment\nof goodwill. In prior periods, we used a combination of both an income (discounted cash flows) and market approach to determine the fair value\nof GRAIL. The income approach utilized projected cash flows for GRAIL based on a long-range plan which contemplated FDA approval and\nestimated cash flows for a 15 year period. Based on this approach, in Q3 2023, we estimated the fair value of GRAIL to be $3.6 billion, using a\nselected discount rate of 24.0%, and recorded a goodwill impairment of $712 million. An increase of 50 to 100 basis points to the discount rate\nused in our assessment at that time would have resulted in additional goodwill impairment of $200 million to $350 million. Using this same\napproach in Q4 2023 suggested no further decrement in fair value. Initial analyst coverage of GRAIL from December 2023 into the spring of\n2024 suggested that GRAIL could be valued between $3 billion and $4 billion. By May 2024, prior to the consummation of the GRAIL Spin-Off,\nadditional information about GRAIL had become available in GRAIL’s amended Form 10 filings and a publicly available management\npresentation, which included updated disclosure about GRAIL’s business and anticipated near term financial trends. Prior to the consummation\nof the GRAIL Spin-Off, the amount of GRAIL’s Disposal Funding, $974 million, was also disclosed. Analyst and banker valuation estimates then\nbegan to estimate fair values between $400 million and $770 million, consistent with the impairment recorded in Q2 2024.\nTo determine the fair value of Core Illumina, we used a combination of both an income and market approach consistent with prior periods. The\nincome approach utilized estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting unit, while the market approach utilized comparable company\ninformation. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach included projected cash flows and a discount rate and represent a Level 3\nmeasurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe also evaluated GRAIL’s in-process research and development (IPR&D) asset for potential impairment, in May 2024, as part of our annual\ntest. We further concluded the when-issued trading activity for GRAIL’s common stock, in June 2024, to be an additional triggering event that\nrequired an additional impairment test be performed. The carrying value of the IPR&D asset exceeded its estimated fair value and we recorded\nan impairment of $420 million in Q2 2024. The fair value of GRAIL’s IPR&D was determined using an income approach, specifically a discounted\ncash flow model. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach, which represent a Level 3 measurement, included projected cash\nflows and a discount rate of 46.5%. The discount rate was derived from reconciling GRAIL’s long-range plan, which contemplated FDA approval\nand estimated cash flows for a 15 year period, to observed market values of GRAIL based on the when-issued trading activity. An increase of\n300 basis points to the discount rate used in our assessment would have resulted in additional impairment of $20 million. There is substantial\nrisk inherent in forecasting revenues and spend associated with research and development, including assumptions around the timing and level\nof resources and investment to be made, which were made more challenging in light of the Spin-Off and related Disposal Funding.\nWe performed a recoverability test for GRAIL’s definite-lived intangible assets, which include developed technology and trade name, noting no\nimpairment. No impairment was noted for Core Illumina definite-lived intangible assets.\nGoodwill\nChanges to goodwill during YTD 2024 were as follows:\nIn millions\nBalance as of December 31, 2023(1) $ 2,545\nAcquisition 34\nImpairment (1,466)\nBalance as of September 29, 2024 $ 1,113\n_____________\n(1) The balance as of December 31, 2023 includes accumulated impairment of $4,626 million related to our GRAIL reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following is a summary of our identifiable intangible assets:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Intangible Gross Intangible\nCarrying Accumulated Assets, Carrying Accumulated Assets,\nIn millions Amount Amortization Net Amount Amortization Impairment Net\nDeveloped technologies $ 465 $ (296) $ 169 $ 2,807 $ (585) $ — $ 2,222\nLicensed technologies 227 (107) 120 274 (133) — 141\nTrade name 2 (2) — 43 (14) — 29\nCustomer relationships 16 (14) 2 14 (13) — 1\nLicense agreements 19 (13) 6 14 (13) — 1\nDatabase 12 (4) 8 12 (3) — 9\nTotal finite-lived intangible\nassets, net 741 (436) 305 3,164 (761) — 2,403\nIn-process research and\ndevelopment (IPR&D) — — — 705 — (115) 590\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 741 $ (436) $ 305 $ 3,869 $ (761) $ (115) $ 2,993\nThe significant decrease in developed technologies, trade name, and IPR&D reflect the GRAIL intangible assets disposed of in connection with\nthe Spin-Off. See note 2. GRAIL Spin-Off for more information. Additionally, in Q1 2024, we placed into service (reflected in developed\ntechnologies) the IPR&D asset we acquired in Q2 2021.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the Fluent BioSciences acquisition in Q3 2024, we recorded a developed technology intangible of $42 million, with a useful life of 7\nyears, and a customer relationship intangible of $2 million, with a useful life of 11 years. We are still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price\nas it relates to the completion of certain tax returns. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year after\nthe acquisition.\nAmortization expense for Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 was $17 million and $113 million, respectively, and $49 million and $148 million in Q3 2023\nand YTD 2023, respectively. The estimated future annual amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is shown in the following table.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair\nvalue in other current assets, other assets, accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities, as appropriate, on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. These derivative financial instruments have terms of one month or less and are not designated as hedging\ninstruments. Changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the re-measurement gain or\nloss on the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. As of September 29, 2024, we had foreign exchange forward contracts in place to\nhedge exposures in the euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, and British pound. As\nof September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts in place for these foreign currency\npurchases were $497 million and $926 million, respectively. In September 2024, as a result of the European Commission withdrawing its\npreviously imposed fine, the related forward contracts we previously entered into for a total notional amount of €432 million were terminated.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge portions of our foreign currency exposure associated with forecasted revenue transactions.\nThese derivative financial instruments have terms up to 24 months and are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of our cash\nflow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to revenue in the same period the\nunderlying hedged transactions are recorded. We regularly review the effectiveness of our hedges and consider them to be ineffective if it\nbecomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur in the identified period. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of our\ncash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in other income (expense), net. As of September 29, 2024, we had foreign currency forward contracts in\nplace to hedge exposures associated with forecasted revenue transactions denominated in the euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian\ndollar, and Chinese Yuan Renminbi. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow\nhedge contracts in place for these foreign currency purchases were $671 million and $628 million, respectively. We reclassified $3 million and\n$10 million to revenue in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively, and $5 million and $9 million to revenue in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts recorded in total assets and total liabilities was $2 million and\n$10 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts recorded in total assets and total liabilities\nwas $5 million and $9 million, respectively.\n26\nTable of Contents\n8. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to intellectual property,\nemployment, and contractual matters. In connection with these matters, we assess, on a regular basis, the probability and range of possible loss\nbased on the developments in these matters. A liability is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements if it is believed to be\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable\nand unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly\nreview outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors,\nwhich include, but are not limited to, past history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. We may change our\nestimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates, resulting in a material\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nAcquisition of GRAIL\nAs of September 6, 2024, all previously disclosed regulatory proceedings in the United States and European Union related to our acquisition of\nGRAIL have been resolved (as further described below).\nOn April 19, 2021, the European Commission sought and subsequently accepted a request for a referral of the GRAIL acquisition for European\nUnion merger review, submitted by a Member State of the European Union (France), and joined by several other EEA Member States (Belgium,\nGreece, Iceland, the Netherlands and Norway), under Article 22(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the EU Merger Regulation). The\nEuropean Commission had never solicited referrals to take jurisdiction over an acquisition of a U.S. company that had no revenue in Europe. On\nApril 28, 2021, we filed an action in the General Court of the European Union (the EU General Court) asking for annulment of the European\nCommission’s assertion of jurisdiction to review the acquisition under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation, as the acquisition does not meet\nthe jurisdictional criteria under the EU Merger Regulation or under the national merger control laws of any Member State of the European Union.\nOn July 13, 2022, the EU General Court reached a decision in favor of the European Commission, holding that the European Commission has\njurisdiction under the EU Merger Regulation to review the acquisition. On September 22, 2022, we filed an appeal in the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (the EU Court of Justice) asking for annulment of the EU General Court’s judgment.\nOn December 17, 2023, we announced that we would divest GRAIL. On April 12, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision approving\nour divestment plan, which was submitted to the EC pursuant to its October 12, 2023 decision requiring Illumina to unwind its acquisition of\nGRAIL. On June 24, 2024, we completed the separation (the Spin-Off) of GRAIL into a separate, independent publicly traded company through\nthe distribution of approximately 85.5% of the outstanding GRAIL common stock to Illumina stockholders on a pro rata basis.\nOn September 3, 2024, the EU Court of Justice ruled in our favor, confirming that the European Commission had unlawfully asserted jurisdiction\nover our acquisition of GRAIL, and hence annulling the EU General Court’s judgment and the European Commission’s decisions accepting the\nreferral of the GRAIL acquisition for EU merger review (the EU Court of Justice Judgment). The EU Court of Justice Judgment concludes these\nproceedings and is not subject to further appeals. In view of this judgment, on September 6, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision\n(the Withdrawal Decision) withdrawing all of its prior decisions, including (1) its July 22, 2021 decision opening an investigation of Illumina’s\nproposed acquisition of GRAIL, (2) its September 6, 2022 decision prohibiting Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL, (3) its October 29, 2021 and\nOctober 28, 2022 decisions concerning interim measures, (4) its October 12, 2023 decision requiring Illumina to unwind its acquisition of GRAIL,\nand (5) its July 12, 2023 decision fining Illumina €432 million and GRAIL for closing the acquisition before approval by the European\nCommission. The Withdrawal Decision resolves all ongoing regulatory proceedings in the European Union.\nAs a result of the European Commission withdrawing its previously imposed fine, we recognized a net gain of $481 million in Q3 2024. We\nrecognized a gain of $489 million in operating expense, resulting from reversal of the accrued fine and related accrued interest, offset by a loss\nof $8 million, recognized in other income (expense), net, for the reversal of associated foreign currency fluctuations. The fine accrued interest at\na rate of 5.5% per annum while it was outstanding. The guarantees we provided in October 2023 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment\nwhile we appealed the European Commission’s jurisdictional and fine decisions are no longer outstanding.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOn August 15, 2024, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission dismissed the previously disclosed administrative complaint in light of the completion\nof the Spin-Off.\nSEC Inquiry Letter\nIn July 2023, we were informed that the staff of the SEC was conducting an investigation relating to Illumina and was requesting documents and\ncommunications primarily related to Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL and certain statements and disclosures concerning GRAIL, its products and\nits acquisition, and related to the conduct and compensation of certain members of Illumina and GRAIL management, among other things.\nIllumina is cooperating with the SEC in this investigation.\nShareholder Derivative Complaints\nOn October 17, 2023, a stockholder derivative and class action complaint captioned Icahn Partners LP, et al. v. deSouza, et al., purportedly\nbrought on behalf of Illumina and public holders of Illumina’s common stock, was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain current\nand former directors (including our former Chief Executive Officer). We are named as a nominal defendant in the complaint. The lawsuit alleges\nthe named directors breached their fiduciary duties by knowingly causing Illumina to unlawfully close the GRAIL acquisition, concealing material\nfacts related to the GRAIL acquisition and making inadequate disclosures. Before the filing of the complaint, the purported stockholders did not\nmake a demand that our Board of Directors pursue the claims asserted therein. The complaint seeks damages, costs and expenses, including\nattorney fees, the certification and consolidation of a putative class, the issuance of amended disclosures, the removal of conflicted directors and\ndeclaratory and other equitable relief. Since the lawsuit is brought in part on behalf of Illumina as a nominal defendant, the alleged damages\nwere allegedly suffered by us.\nOn November 1, 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which has not yet been briefed. On the same day, Illumina-joined\nby the director defendants-moved to strike portions of the complaint that contain improperly included confidential and privileged information. On\nJanuary 16, 2024, the Court granted the motion to strike. On December 5, 2023, the plaintiffs moved to expedite the proceedings with respect to\ntheir direct claims. The director defendants opposed that motion and Illumina joined their opposition. On January 19, 2024, the Court denied\nplaintiffs’ motion to expedite. On January 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reargument of the Court’s January 16 opinion, which the Court\ndenied on February 19, 2024. On February 29, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an application to the trial court to certify the orders granting the motion to\nstrike and denying the motion for reargument for interlocutory appeal. The Court refused the application on March 20, 2024. On March 14, 2024,\nthe plaintiffs filed an application for interlocutory appeal with the Supreme Court of Delaware, which the Court denied on April 11, 2024.\nOn February 26, 2024, a stockholder derivative complaint captioned City of Omaha Police and Firefighters Retirement System v. deSouza, et al.,\npurportedly brought on behalf of Illumina, was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain current and former directors. On April 16,\n2024, a stockholder derivative complaint captioned City of Roseville General Employees Retirement System, et al. v. deSouza, et al., purportedly\nbrought on behalf of Illumina, was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain current and former directors and officers. On August\n16, 2024, a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Thomas P. DiNapoli v. John Thompson et al., purportedly brought on behalf of Illumina,\nwas filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain current and former directors. We are named as a nominal defendant in the\ncomplaints. The lawsuits allege the named directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by knowingly causing Illumina to unlawfully close\nthe GRAIL acquisition. The stockholders previously made requests to inspect certain books and records under Delaware law, and they purport to\nbase their complaint in part on documents obtained from Illumina in response to those requests. Before the filing of the complaint, the purported\nstockholders did not make a demand that our Board of Directors pursue the claim asserted therein. The complaints seek damages, costs and\nexpenses, including attorney fees and other equitable relief. Since the lawsuits are brought in part on behalf of Illumina as a nominal defendant,\nthe alleged damages were allegedly suffered by us.\nOn March 26, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the lawsuit filed by City of Omaha Police and Firefighters\nRetirement System. The motion has not yet been briefed. On May 16, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the lawsuit\nfiled by City of Roseville General Employees Retirement System, et al. The motion has not yet been briefed. On September 16, 2024, the\ndefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the lawsuit filed by Thomas DiNapoli. The motion has not yet been briefed.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIn light of the fact that these lawsuits are in an early stage, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the suits. We deny the allegations in the\ncomplaints and intend to vigorously defend the litigations.\nOn February 21, 2024, a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Elaine Wang, et al. v. deSouza, et al., purportedly brought on behalf of the\nCompany was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (District of Delaware) against certain current and former\ndirectors. The Company is named as a nominal defendant in the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that the named directors breached their fiduciary\nduties by knowingly causing the Company to unlawfully close the GRAIL acquisition. Before the filing of the complaint, the purported stockholder\ndid not make a demand that our Board of Directors pursue the asserted claims therein. The complaint seeks, among other things, restitution to\nthe Company for the alleged damages caused by the named defendants. Since the lawsuit was brought in part on behalf of Illumina as a\nnominal defendant, the alleged damages were allegedly suffered by us.\nOn March 8, 2024, a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Michael Warner, et al. v. deSouza, et al., purportedly brought on behalf of\nIllumina was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against certain current and former directors. We\nare named as a nominal defendant in the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that the named directors breached their fiduciary duties by knowingly\ncausing us to unlawfully close the GRAIL acquisition. Before the filing of the complaint, the purported stockholder did not make a demand that\nour Board of Directors pursue the asserted claims therein. The complaint seeks, among other things, restitution to Illumina for the alleged\ndamages caused by the named defendants. Since the lawsuit was brought in part on behalf of Illumina as a nominal defendant, the alleged\ndamages were allegedly suffered by us. On March 28, 2024, the parties submitted a Joint Motion to Transfer the lawsuit to the District of\nDelaware, which the Court granted on March 29, 2024, and the Court transferred the lawsuit to the District of Delaware on the same day.\nElaine Wang, et al. v. deSouza, et al. and Michael Warner, et al. v. deSouza, et al. were voluntarily dismissed on April 29, 2024, and May 1,\n2024, respectively. On May 1, 2024, Michael Warner sent a litigation demand to our Board of Directors requesting that a civil action for monetary\ndamages be brought by the Board of Directors on behalf of Illumina against officers and directors involved with the GRAIL acquisition. On July\n30, 2024, the Board unanimously determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to defer a final decision on the\ndemand given, among other things, the pending stockholder lawsuits described herein and the similarity of issues raised in the demand and\nthose lawsuits. Our Board will monitor the stockholder lawsuits and revisit the demand as warranted as the lawsuits progress. On June 3, 2024,\nElaine Wang made requests to inspect certain books and records under Delaware law and the Company sent a production of documents in\nresponse to that demand.\nOn August 21, 2024, an additional stockholder, Jane Davidson, sent a litigation demand to our Board of Directors requesting that a civil action for\nbreaches of fiduciary duty, indemnification, contribution and other appropriate claims be brought by the Board of Directors on behalf of Illumina\nagainst officers and directors involved with the GRAIL acquisition. On October 29, 2024, the Board unanimously determined that it was in the\nbest interest of the Company and its shareholders to defer a final decision on the demand given, among other things, the pending stockholder\nlawsuits described herein and the similarity of issues raised in the demand and those lawsuits. Our Board will monitor the stockholder lawsuits\nand revisit the demand as warranted as the lawsuits progress.\nSecurities Class Actions\nFederal Securities Class Actions. On November 11, 2023, the first of three securities class action complaints was filed against Illumina and\ncertain of its current and former executive officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The first-filed case is\ncaptioned Kangas v. Illumina, Inc. et al., the second-filed case is captioned Roy v. Illumina, Inc. et al., and the third-filed case is captioned\nLouisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund v. Illumina, Inc. et al. (collectively, the Actions). The complaints generally allege, among other things,\nthat defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts relating to Illumina’s acquisition of Grail. The\ncomplaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On January 9, 2024, four movants filed motions to consolidate the Actions and\nto appoint a lead plaintiff (Lead Plaintiff Motions). On April 11, 2024, the Court issued an order consolidating the Actions into a single action\n(captioned in re Illumina, Inc. Securities Litigation No. 23-cv-2082-LL-MMP), and appointed Universal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbH, UI BVK\nKapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, and ACATIS Investment Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH as lead plaintiffs (the Lead Plaintiffs). On\nJune 21, 2024, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint. The complaint alleges that Illumina and GRAIL and certain of their\ncurrent and former directors and officers violated\n29\nTable of Contents\nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL. On September\n13, 2024, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint. Illumina’s response is due November 12, 2024.\nState Securities Class Actions. On February 2, 2024, the first of two additional securities class actions was filed against Illumina, certain of its\nofficers and directors, and several other individuals and entities in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, captioned\nLoren Scott Mar v. Illumina, et al. and Scott Zerzanek v. Illumina, Inc. et al.. Both complaints generally allege, among other things, that\ndefendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts in the November 2020 and February 2021 registration\nstatements and prospectus relating to Illumina’s acquisition of Grail. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On\nMarch 29, 2024, the parties to the actions filed a Joint Stipulation to Consolidate the actions and to appoint co-lead counsel for plaintiffs, which\nthe Court granted on April 5, 2024. On August 12, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint. On September 6, 2024, Illumina and the\nother named defendants filed a motion to stay the litigation. On October 4, 2024, the plaintiffs opposed the motion to stay. A hearing on the\nmotion to stay is scheduled for December 6, 2024.\nIn light of the fact that the lawsuits are in an early stage, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the suits. We deny the allegations in the\ncomplaints and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.\nDOJ Civil Investigative Demand\nOn January 18, 2024, we received a civil investigative demand (CID) from the U.S. Department of Justice, requiring production of certain\ndocuments and information in the course of a False Claims Act investigation to determine whether there is or has been a violation of 31 U.S.C. §\n3729. The False Claims Act investigation concerns allegations that the Company caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and other\nfederal government programs because it misrepresented its compliance with cybersecurity requirements to the Food and Drug Administration\nand other federal agencies that purchase its devices. The Company is cooperating with the government.\nBooks and Records Action\nOn February 14, 2024, a stockholder filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned Pavers and Road Builders Benefit Funds v.\nIllumina, Inc. seeking to inspect certain books and records related to the GRAIL transaction, including certain materials and minutes from\nmeetings of our Board of Directors, which have been withheld because the Company contends they are non-responsive to the request or subject\nto the attorney-client privilege. Illumina previously provided documents to the stockholder in response to a demand made by letter under\nDelaware law, but the stockholder seeks additional and unredacted materials through this action. On March 11, 2024, Illumina filed an answer to\nthe complaint, denying that the stockholder was entitled to inspection. We deny that the stockholder is entitled to review the documents and\nintend to vigorously defend the litigation. The trial took place on June 7, 2024. On July 16, 2024, the Court issued a decision requiring the\nCompany to produce certain additional documents to plaintiff. On July 26, 2024, the stockholder filed a motion seeking in camera review of\ncertain documents that the Company maintains are not subject to the Court’s July 16, 2024 order to produce documents. The Court granted the\nmotion on August 19, 2024, and the Company filed the documents for in camera review on August 29, 2024. On October 7, 2024, the Court ruled\nthat the Company need not produce the documents subject to the motion for in camera review because they are privileged under the attorney\nopinion work product doctrine.\n9. INCOME TAXES\nOur effective tax rate may vary from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different\nstatutory rates, benefits related to tax credits, and the tax impact of non-deductible expenses and other permanent differences between income\n(loss) before income taxes and taxable income.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rates for Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 were 2.1% and (3.2)%, respectively, compared to 3.6% and (3.8)% in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023,\nrespectively. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% for Q3 2024 was primarily because of the $25 million income tax\nexpense impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, and the Pillar Two global\nminimum top-up tax, respectively, and the $10 million income tax expense impact of capitalizing research and development expenses for tax\npurposes. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% for YTD 2024 was primarily because of the $308 million income tax\nexpense impact from the impairment of goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes, $141 million income tax expense impact of GRAIL pre-\nacquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, and the Pillar Two global minimum top-up tax, and the\n$53 million income tax expense impact of capitalizing research and development expenses for tax purposes. The income tax rate in Q3 2024\nand YTD 2024 was favorably impacted by the reversal of the European Commission fine related to the GRAIL acquisition, which is excluded\nfrom taxable income, and by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as in\nSingapore.\nAs of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid income taxes, included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, were $16 million and $75 million, respectively.\n10. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe report segment information based on the management approach, which designates the internal reporting used by the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (CODM) for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.

Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that\nmay occur in future periods.\nMANAGEMENT’S OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nThis overview and outlook provide a high-level discussion of our operating results and significant known trends that affect our business. We\nbelieve that an understanding of these trends is important to understanding our financial results for the periods being reported herein as well as\nour future financial performance. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion\nand analysis provided elsewhere in this report.\nAbout Illumina\nOur focus on innovation has established us as a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, serving customers in the\nresearch, clinical and applied markets.

We retained approximately 14.5% of the shares of\nGRAIL common stock immediately following the Spin-Off. The disposition of GRAIL did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued\noperation and accordingly, GRAIL’s assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows have not been reclassified. In connection with the\nSpin-Off, Illumina’s stockholders received one share of GRAIL common stock for every six shares of Illumina common stock held on the Record\nDate. Refer to note 2. GRAIL Spin-Off for further details.\nSee note 10. Segment Information for details regarding our reportable segments.\nOur financial results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by several significant trends, which are described below. While these trends\nare important to understanding and evaluating our financial results, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto within the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report, and the\nother transactions, events, and trends discussed in Risk Factors within the Other Key Information section of this report.\nFinancial Overview\nSince 2023, macroeconomic factors such as inflation, exchange rate fluctuations and concerns about an economic downturn, competitive\nchallenges in our China region, and the sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine have\nimpacted both Illumina directly and our customers’ behavior. For example, some customers experienced supply chain pressures that delayed\ntheir lab expansions and others are managing inventory and capital more conservatively. We expect these factors to continue to have an impact\non our sales and results of operations for the remainder of 2024, the size and duration of which is significantly uncertain.\nFinancial highlights for YTD 2024 included the following:\n• Revenue decreased 3% in YTD 2024 to $3,268 million compared to $3,382 million in YTD 2023 primarily due to a decrease in\nsequencing instruments revenue, driven by fewer shipments of our high-throughput and mid-throughout instruments, offset by\nincreases in sequencing consumables revenue and service and other revenue, primarily driven by our strategic partnerships and\nservice contracts.\n• Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) was 65.3% in YTD 2024 compared to 61.2% in YTD 2023. The increase in\ngross margin was driven primarily by execution of our operational excellence priorities that delivered cost savings, including freight,\nand improved productivity, a more favorable mix of sequencing consumables, and a decrease in warranty and field service costs.\nThis was offset by certain strategic partnership revenue that is lower margin. Our gross margin depends on many factors, including:\nmarket conditions that may impact our pricing; sales mix changes among consumables, instruments, services, and development and\nlicensing revenue; product mix changes between established products and new products; excess and obsolete inventories; royalties;\nour cost structure for manufacturing operations relative to volume; freight costs; and product support obligations.\n• Loss from operations was $1,008 million in YTD 2024 compared to $905 million in YTD 2023. The increase in loss from operations\nwas due to an increase in operating expense of $166 million, which included an increase in goodwill and intangible impairment of\n$1,068 million, offset by a $488 million favorable impact in legal contingency and settlement, as a result of the European\nCommission withdrawing its previously imposed fine in September 2024, and an increase in the gains recognized on our GRAIL\ncontingent consideration liability of $222 million, offset by a $63 million increase in gross profit. We continue to focus on our cost\nreduction initiatives to accelerate progress toward higher margins and create flexibility for further investment in high-growth areas.\n33\nTable of Contents\n• Our effective tax rate was (3.2)% in YTD 2024 compared to (3.8)% in YTD 2023. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax\nrate of 21% was primarily because of the income tax expense impact of the impairment of goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax\npurposes, the income tax expense impact of the reversal of the European Commission fine related to the GRAIL acquisition, which\nis excluded from taxable income, the income tax expense impact of research and development expense capitalization for tax\npurposes, and the income tax expense impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign\ntax credits, and the Pillar Two global minimum top-up tax. This was partially offset by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower\nstatutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as in Singapore.\n• We ended Q3 2024 with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $939 million, of which approximately $464\nmillion was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTo enhance comparability, the following table sets forth unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the specified\nreporting periods, stated as a percentage of total revenue.(1)\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nRevenue:\nProduct revenue 84.6 % 84.1 % 83.2 % 84.7 %\nService and other revenue 15.4 15.9 16.8 15.3\nTotal revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\nCost of revenue:\nCost of product revenue 21.8 26.2 22.5 26.1\nCost of service and other revenue 7.8 8.5 8.8 8.4\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 1.5 4.2 3.4 4.3\nTotal cost of revenue 31.1 38.9 34.7 38.8\nGross profit 68.9 61.1 65.3 61.2\nOperating expense:\nResearch and development 23.4 28.1 27.9 30.0\nSelling, general and administrative 22.2 27.0 24.8 33.3\nGoodwill and intangible impairment — 73.4 57.8 24.3\nLegal contingency and settlement (45.3) (0.1) (14.4) 0.4\nTotal operating expense 0.3 128.4 96.1 88.0\nIncome (loss) from operations 68.6 (67.3) (30.8) (26.8)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income 1.0 1.2 1.1 1.4\nInterest expense (3.4) (1.7) (2.3) (1.7)\nOther income (expense), net 0.4 (2.1) (9.8) (1.0)\nTotal other expense, net (2.0) (2.6) (11.0) (1.3)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 66.6 (69.9) (41.8) (28.1)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 1.4 (2.5) 1.3 1.1\nNet income (loss) 65.2 % (67.4)% (43.1)% (29.2)%\n_____________\n(1) Percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nDollars in millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Change % Change YTD 2024 YTD 2023 Change % Change\nCore Illumina:\nConsumables $ 807 $ 766 $ 41 5 % $ 2,390 $ 2,344 $ 46 2 %\nInstruments 107 182 (75) (41) 342 539 (197) (37)\nTotal product revenue 914 948 (34) (4) 2,732 2,883 (151) (5)\nService and other revenue 166 158 8 5 496 458 38 8\nTotal Core Illumina\nrevenue 1,080 1,106 (26) (2) 3,228 3,341 (113) (3)\nGRAIL:\nService and other revenue — 21 (21) (100) 55 62 (7) (11)\nEliminations — (8) 8 100 (15) (21) 6 (29)\nTotal consolidated\nrevenue $ 1,080 $ 1,119 $ (39) (3)% $ 3,268 $ 3,382 $ (114) (3)%\nCore Illumina consumables revenue increased in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 primarily due to an increase in sequencing consumables revenue of\n$46 million and $48 million, respectively, driven primarily by an increase in NovaSeq X consumables. Core Illumina instruments revenue\ndecreased in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 primarily due to a decrease in sequencing instruments revenue of $75 million and $196 million,\nrespectively, driven by fewer shipments of our high-throughput instruments, given we entered 2024 with a lower backlog of NovaSeq X\ninstruments, as compared to 2023, given significant pre-orders following the launch, and fewer shipments of our mid-throughput instruments,\nprimarily as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact our customer’s purchasing behavior. Core Illumina service and other revenue\nincreased in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 primarily due to increased revenue from our strategic partnerships and extended maintenance service\ncontracts, partially offset by decreased revenue from development and licensing agreements. The increase in YTD 2024 Core Illumina service\nand other revenue was also partially offset by decreased revenue from genotyping services.\nThe decrease in GRAIL revenue in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 was due to the Spin-Off in Q2 2024.\nGross Margin\nDollars in millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Change % Change YTD 2024 YTD 2023 Change % Change\nGross profit (loss):\nCore Illumina $ 745 $ 715 $ 30 4 % $ 2,181 $ 2,161 $ 20 1 %\nGRAIL — (27) 27 (100) (38) (77) 39 (51)\nEliminations — (4) 4 (100) (10) (14) 4 (29)\nConsolidated gross profit $ 745 $ 684 $ 61 9 % $ 2,133 $ 2,070 $ 63 3 %\nGross margin:\nCore Illumina 68.9 % 64.7 % 67.6 % 64.7 %\nGRAIL * * * *\nConsolidated gross margin 68.9 % 61.1 % 65.3 % 61.2 %\n________________\n* Not meaningful.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in Core Illumina gross margin in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 was driven primarily by a favorable impact from the execution of our\noperational excellence priorities that delivered cost savings, including freight, and improved productivity, a more favorable mix of sequencing\nconsumables, and a decrease in warranty and field service costs.

The decrease was offset by increases in share-based\ncompensation expense related to PSU awards and GRAIL-related transaction expenses, which included $53 million of expenses incurred in YTD\n2024 directly related to the Spin-Off.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in GRAIL R&D and SG&A expense in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 was due to the Spin-Off in Q2 2024.\nGRAIL goodwill and intangible impairment for YTD 2024 consisted of goodwill impairment of $1,466 million and IPR&D intangible asset\nimpairment of $420 million as a result of performing impairment tests in Q2 2024. See note 7. Supplemental Balance Sheet Details for additional\ninformation. GRAIL goodwill and intangible impairment for Q3 2023 and YTD 2023 consisted of goodwill impairment of $712 million and IPR&D\nintangible asset impairment of $109 million as a result of performing an interim impairment test in Q3 2023. Core Illumina goodwill and intangible\nimpairment for YTD 2024 consisted of an IPR&D intangible asset impairment recorded in Q1 2024.\nCore Illumina legal contingency and settlement in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 primarily consisted of a gain of $489 million resulting from the reversal\nof the EC fine accrual, and related accrued interest, following the European Commission’s decision to withdraw its previously imposed fine. See\nnote 8. Legal Proceedings for additional details. Core Illumina legal contingency and settlement in YTD 2023 primarily consisted of an\nadjustment to our accrual for the fine previously imposed by the European Commission and other patent litigation settlement activity.\nOther Income (Expense)\nDollars in millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Change % Change YTD 2024 YTD 2023 Change % Change\nInterest income $ 11 $ 13 $ (2) (15)% $ 36 $ 47 $ (11) (23)%\nInterest expense (36) (19) (17) 89 (75) (59) (16) 27\nOther income (expense),\nnet 4 (22) 26 (118) (319) (33) (286) 867\nTotal other expense, net $ (21) $ (28) $ 7 (25)% $ (358) $ (45) $ (313) 696 %\nTotal other expense, net primarily relates to the Core Illumina segment.\nInterest income in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 consisted primarily of interest on our money market funds, which decreased primarily due to a lower\ncash balance in Q3 2024 as compared to the prior year. Interest expense consisted primarily of interest on our outstanding term debt and a loss\non debt extinguishment of $5 million related to the repayment of our delayed draw term loan in Q3 2024. The fluctuation in other income\n(expense), net in Q3 2024 was primarily driven by a favorable net impact related to foreign currency activity as compared to the prior period and\na decrease in net losses recognized on our strategic investments of $7 million. The fluctuation in other income (expense), net in YTD 2024 was\nprimarily driven by an increase in net losses recognized on our strategic investments of $303 million, which included an unrealized loss of $332\nmillion on our retained investment in GRAIL subsequent to the Spin-Off. This was offset by a favorable net impact related to foreign currency\nactivity as compared to the prior year and an increase in the gains recognized on our Helix contingent value right of $7 million.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nDollars in millions Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Change % Change YTD 2024 YTD 2023 Change % Change\nIncome (loss) before\nincome taxes $ 720 $ (782) $ 1,502 (192)% $ (1,366) $ (950) $ (416) 44 %\nProvision (benefit) for\nincome taxes 15 (28) 43 (154) 44 36 8 22\nNet income (loss) $ 705 $ (754) $ 1,459 (194)% $ (1,410) $ (986) $ (424) 43 %\nEffective tax rate 2.1 % 3.6 % (3.2)% (3.8)%\n37\nTable of Contents\nOur effective tax rate was 2.1% and (3.2)% in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively, compared to 3.6% and (3.8)% in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023,\nrespectively. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% for Q3 2024 was primarily because of the $25 million income tax\nexpense impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, and the Pillar Two global\nminimum top-up tax, respectively, and the $10 million income tax expense impact of capitalizing research and development expenses for tax\npurposes. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% for YTD 2024 was primarily because of the $308 million income tax\nexpense impact from the impairment of goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes, $141 million income tax expense impact of GRAIL pre-\nacquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, and the Pillar Two global minimum top-up tax, and the\n$53 million income tax expense impact of capitalizing research and development expenses for tax purposes. The income tax rate in Q3 2024\nand YTD 2024 was favorably impacted by the reversal of the European Commission fine related to the GRAIL acquisition, which is excluded\nfrom taxable income, and by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as in\nSingapore.\nIn Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, the variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily because of the $149 million income tax\nexpense impact from the impairment of goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes, the $20 million and $84 million income tax expense\nimpact of capitalizing research and development expenses for tax purposes, respectively, and the $38 million and $63 million income tax\nexpense impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI and the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, respectively. The income\ntax expense in Q3 2023 and YTD 2023 were also favorably impacted by the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as in Singapore.\nOur future effective tax rate may vary from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory\ntax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” described in “Risk\nFactors” within the Business & Market Information section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had $869 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $464 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash\nand cash equivalents decreased by $179 million from December 31, 2023 due to factors described in the “Cash Flow Summary” below. In\nconnection with the Spin-Off, we derecognized GRAIL’s cash and cash equivalents of $968 million, which included the required Disposal\nFunding (see note 2. GRAIL Spin-Off). Our primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, has\nbeen cash flows from operations and, from time to time, issuances of debt. During YTD 2024, we received net proceeds from the issuance of our\n2026 Term Notes of $497 million and repaid our delayed draw term loan of $750 million. Our ability to generate cash from operations,\nsupplemented with the issuance of debt and/or liquidation of our short-term investments, provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet\noperating, investing, and financing needs. As of September 29, 2024, we had $70 million in short-term investments, comprised of marketable\nequity securities.\nIn September 2024, the European Commission withdrew its previously imposed fine of €432 million. Accordingly, we reversed the related accrual\nand recognized a net gain of $481 million in Q3 2024. The guarantees we provided in October 2023 to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash\npayment while we appealed the European Commission’s jurisdictional and fine decisions are no longer outstanding. Refer to note 8. Legal\nProceedings for additional details.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a 364-day Delayed Draw Credit Facility, which provided us with a senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an\naggregate principal amount of up to $750 million. On June 20, 2024, we borrowed $750 million on the Delayed Draw Credit Facility. The delayed\ndraw term loan incurred interest at a rate of 6.7%. On September 9, 2024, we repaid the full principal amount outstanding under the Delayed\nDraw Credit Facility, including accrued interest, of $761 million and terminated the Delayed Draw Credit Agreement.\nOn September 9, 2024, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Term Notes. We received net proceeds of $497 million,\nwhich were used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt under the Delayed Draw Credit Agreement. The 2026 Term Notes, which mature on\nSeptember 9, 2026, accrue interest at a rate of 4.650% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 9 and September 9 of each year, beginning\non March 9, 2025. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Term Notes, at our option, at any time prior to maturity.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Term Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2027\nTerm Notes. The 2025 Term Notes, which mature on December 12, 2025, and the 2027 Term Notes, which mature on December 13, 2027,\naccrue interest at a rate of 5.800% and 5.750% per annum, respectively, payable semi-annually in June and December of each year. In March\n2021, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2031 Term Notes, which mature on March 23, 2031, and accrue interest at a rate of\n2.550% per annum, payable semi-annually in March and September of each year. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025, 2027,\nor 2031 Term Notes, at our option, at any time prior to maturity.\nIn January 2023, we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement, which provides us with a $750 million senior unsecured five year revolving\ncredit facility, including a $40 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit. The credit facility matures,\nand all amounts outstanding become due and payable in full, on January 4, 2028, subject to two one-year extensions at our option and consent\nof the extending lenders and certain other conditions. As of September 29, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to GRAIL was $82 million, of which $81 million was\nincluded in other long-term liabilities. The contingent value rights entitle the holders to receive future cash payments on a quarterly basis\n(Covered Revenue Payments) representing a pro rata portion of certain GRAIL-related revenues (Covered Revenues) each year through August\n2033. This reflects a 2.5% payment right to the first $1 billion of revenue each year for 12 years. Revenue above $1 billion each year is subject\nto a 9% contingent payment right during this same period. In YTD 2024, we paid $836,000 in aggregate Covered Revenue Payments related to\nCovered Revenues for the period Q4 2023 through Q2 2024 of $89 million in aggregate.\nIn August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, which cancels and supersedes all prior and available\nrepurchase authorizations, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock. The repurchases may be completed through open\nmarket purchases, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18, or through an accelerated share repurchase program. Authorizations to repurchase\nup to $1.4 billion of our outstanding common stock remained available as of September 29, 2024.\nWe had $3 million (plus recallable distributions of approximately $10 million), $49 million, and $47 million, respectively, remaining in our capital\ncommitments to three venture capital investment funds as of September 29, 2024 that are callable through April 2026, July 2029, and December\n2034, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with cash provided by operating activities and\navailable borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, are sufficient to fund our near-term capital and operating needs for at least the\nnext 12 months. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and\ncapital expenditures. Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, may include:\n• support of commercialization efforts related to our current and future products;\n• acquisitions of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development\nfacilities;\n• the continued advancement of research and development efforts;\n• potential strategic acquisitions and investments;\n• repayment of debt obligations;\n• repurchases of our outstanding common stock; and\n• the evolving needs of our facilities, including costs of leasing and building out facilities.\nWe expect that our revenue and results of operations, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly\nimpact our cash management decisions. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors,\nincluding:\n• our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;\n39\nTable of Contents\n• scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs;\n• competing technological and market developments; and\n• the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement\nour product and service offerings.\nCash Flow Summary\nIn millions YTD 2024 YTD 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 473 $ 254\nNet cash used in investing activities (130) (146)\nNet cash used in financing activities (523) (1,183)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (9)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (179) $ (1,084)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in YTD 2024 consisted of a net loss of $1,410 million, plus net adjustments of $2,368 million, less net\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities of $485 million. The primary adjustments to net loss included goodwill and intangible impairment of\n$1,889 million, net loss on strategic investments of $342 million, share-based compensation expense of $291 million, depreciation and\namortization expense of $283 million, and property and equipment and right-of-use asset impairment of $32 million, offset by change in fair value\nof contingent consideration liabilities of $304 million and deferred income taxes of $161 million. Cash flow impact from changes in net operating\nassets and liabilities were primarily driven by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $130 million in YTD 2024. We invested $99 million in capital expenditures, primarily associated with\ninvestments in facilities, paid $81 million for an acquisition, net of cash acquired, and other intangible assets, and purchased strategic\ninvestments, net of distributions, of $33 million. This was offset by the receipt of $83 million related to the settlement of our Helix contingent\nvalue right.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $523 million in YTD 2024. We deconsolidated cash and cash equivalents of $968 million, as a result\nof the GRAIL Spin-Off, repaid our delayed draw term loan of $750 million, and used $99 million to repurchase our common stock. This was offset\nby net borrowings on the Delayed Draw Credit Facility of $744 million, net proceeds received from the issuance of our 2026 Term Notes of\n$497 million, and proceeds received from the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $56 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant\nimpact on our net revenue, operating income (loss), and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance\nsheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in “Critical Accounting Policies\nand Estimates” within the Management’s Discussion & Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider them to be our critical accounting policies\nand estimates. Though macroeconomic factors such as inflation, exchange rate fluctuations and concerns about an economic downturn present\nadditional uncertainty, we continue to use the best information available to inform our critical accounting estimates. There were no material\nchanges to our critical accounting policies and estimates during YTD 2024.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our condensed consolidated financial statements, see note 1. Organization\nand Significant Accounting Policies within the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report, which is incorporated herein\nby reference.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere were no substantial changes to our market risks in YTD 2024, when compared to the disclosures in “Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk” within the Management’s Discussion & Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023.\nOTHER KEY INFORMATION\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are\nsafeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our\nestablished financial policies.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we continued to monitor and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of key controls. There were no\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial\nofficer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee discussion of legal proceedings in note 8. Legal Proceedings in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report,\nwhich is incorporated herein by reference.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described in “Risk Factors” within the Business & Market Information section of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the “Other Key Information” section of our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, which we strongly encourage you to review. In addition to the risk factors\ndisclosed in our Form 10-K, the issues raised in the following risk factor could adversely affect our operating results and stock price:\nOn June 24, 2024, we completed the separation of GRAIL into a separate, independent publicly traded company. As of September 6,\n2024, all previously disclosed regulatory proceedings in the United States and European Union related to our acquisition of GRAIL\n(the Acquisition) have come to an end. Litigation, regulation, and other proceedings related to or resulting from the Acquisition have\nresulted in operational restrictions and increased costs and could result in similar additional future consequences or further result in\nloss of revenues.\n41\nTable of Contents\nAs previously disclosed, the Acquisition was subject to various legal challenges, including by the FTC and European Commission. As a result,\nwe have been a party to a number of regulatory and administrative proceedings regarding the Acquisition.\nOn June 24, 2024, we completed the separation (the Spin-Off) of GRAIL into a separate, independent publicly traded company as described in\nnote 2. GRAIL Spin-Off within the Consolidated Financial Statements. We incurred significant costs to complete the Spin-Off, including\nsignificant legal, financial advisory, regulatory and other professional services fees and additional expenses, and assumed certain liabilities in\nconnection therewith. The Spin-Off also may result in loss of revenue and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations. In addition, we have experienced and might continue to experience negative impacts on our stock price. We cannot predict what\nother adverse consequences to, among other things, our reputation, our relationships with governmental or regulatory authorities, or our ability to\nsuccessfully complete future transactions, our ability to attract, retain and motivate customers, key personnel and those with whom we conduct\nbusiness may result.\nFurthermore, we have and may continue to become subject to stockholder inspection demands under Delaware law, investigations initiated by\nregulators and law firms, and derivative or other similar litigation that can be expensive, divert management attention and human and financial\ncapital to less productive uses and result in potential reputational damage. The GRAIL acquisition and subsequent litigation resulted in (i) the\nannouncement of an investigation by the SEC and others by law firms of possible securities law violations; (ii) stockholder inspection demands\nseeking to investigate possible breaches of fiduciary duties, corporate wrongdoing or a lack of independence of the members of the Board,\nincluding a complaint filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to inspect books and records captioned Pavers and Road Builders Benefit\nFunds v. Illumina, Inc.; (iii) the filing of four securities class actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California:\nKangas v. Illumina, Inc. et al., Roy v. Illumina, Inc. et al., Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund v. Illumina, Inc. et al. and Warner v. deSouza\net al.; (iv) the filing of a securities class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Wang v. deSouza et al.;\n(v) the filing of two securities class actions in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo: Loren Scott Mar v. Illumina, et\nal. and Scott Zerzanek v. Illumina, Inc. et al.; (vi) the filing of a stockholder derivative and class action complaint captioned Icahn Partners LP, et\nal. v. deSouza, et al.; (vii) the filing of a stockholder derivative complaint captioned City of Omaha Police and Firefighters Retirement System v.\ndeSouza, et al.; (viii) the filing of a stockholder derivative complaint captioned City of Roseville General Employees Retirement System, et al. v.\ndeSouza, et al.; and (ix) the filing of a stockholder derivative complaint captioned Thomas P. DiNapoli v. John Thompson et al. See note 8. Legal\nProceedings within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In the event that any of the matters described above result in one\nor more adverse judgments or settlements, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND SALES\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nIn August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, which cancels and supersedes all prior and available\nrepurchase authorizations, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock. The repurchases may be completed through open\nmarket purchases, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18, or through an accelerated share repurchase program.

All rights reserved.\nStatement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe company reports non-GAAP results for diluted earnings per share, net income, gross margin, operating expenses,\nincluding research and development expense, selling general and administrative expense, legal contingencies and\nsettlement, and goodwill and intangible impairment, operating income, operating margin, gross profit, other income\n(expense), tax provision, constant currency revenue growth, and free cash flow (on a consolidated and, as applicable,\nsegment basis) in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. The company’s financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of\nacquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the\neffects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating\nperformance. Non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share and operating margin are key components of the\nfinancial metrics utilized by the company’s board of directors to measure, in part, management’s performance and\ndetermine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP\ninformation and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\nThe company provides forward-looking guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The company is unable to provide a\nreconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial\nmeasures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of items such as acquisition-related\nexpenses, gains and losses from strategic investments, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, potential\nfuture asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without unreasonable\neffort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could have a material\nimpact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the\nsignificance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\nUse of forward-looking statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to\nwhich our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking\nstatements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of customer\norders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our revenue\nexpectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of products and\nservices competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products\nand services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical\ncomponents; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and\nservices; (viii) our ability to modify our business strategies to accomplish our desired operational goals; (ix) our ability to\nrealize the anticipated benefits from prior or future actions to streamline and improve our R&D processes, reduce our\noperating expenses and maximize our revenue growth; (x) our ability to further develop and commercialize our\ninstruments, consumables, and products; (xi) to deploy new products, services, and applications, and to expand the\nmarkets for our technology platforms; (xii) the risks and costs associated with the divestment of GRAIL; (xiii) the risk of\nadditional litigation arising against us in connection with the GRAIL acquisition; (xiv) our ability to obtain approval by\nthird-party payors to reimburse patients for our products; (xv) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products\nfrom government agencies; (xvi) our ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop\nnew products, expand markets, and grow our business; (xvii) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions,\nincluding as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth or armed conflict; (xviii) the application of generally\naccepted accounting principles, which are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and\njudgments and (xix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, together with other factors detailed in our filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in\ninformation disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

Nov. 12, 2024 –** New real-world data from Providence, Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN), and Microsoft Research reveals that Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP), when done early in a cancer patient’s diagnosis, leads to better personalized treatment and patient outcomes. The findings come out of the first two years of a five-year, real-world study, which was published today in the [Journal of Clinical Oncology - Oncology Practice](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.24.00226) (JCO-OP). \n\nThrough a novel approach, the study employed pathologist-driven CGP testing making test results available 12 days prior to the patient’s initial medical oncologist visit. The study found that the availability of test results at the initial visit influenced the early clinical decision-making process and led to over half of the patients receiving biomarker-driven targeted therapy or immunotherapy, which in turn significantly improved overall survival of 25 months for patients treated with targeted therapy compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. \n\nBy observing test actionability rates, therapy choice and outcomes across 3,216 advanced cancer patients across several cancer types, the study found:\n\n·CGP test can identify actionable mutations based on either guideline-based treatment or clinical-trial matching for **67%** of tumors, compared to only 33% of tumors with small-panel test\n\n·**52%** of CGP-tested patients received a matched targeted therapy or immunotherapy as opposed to 32% of patients who received conventional systemic chemotherapy alone. Patients who received a targeted therapy had significantly better overall survival as opposed to patients who received only chemotherapy (25 months vs. 17 months, p<0.001)\n\nThe publication of this paper comes on the heels of [another study from this team of researchers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949820124000353), which found a similar clinical impact for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients tested with CGP.  This recently published study presented comparative analysis between patients with advanced NSLCL tested with CGP and small panel and found that in comparison to small panel-tested patients, CGP patients had a higher rate of actionable mutations (77% vs. 63%, p<0.001), patients with actionable mutations received matched precision therapies at a higher rate (64% vs. 50%, p<0.001) and improvement in overall survival (median: 16 months vs. 7 months, p<0.0001). \n\n“Both of these novel studies, as well as the impact of the findings, underscores the importance of CGP being folded into standard of care diagnostic practices,” said Carlo Bifulco, M.D., chief medical officer of Providence Genomics and a co-author of the study. “By getting CGP test results in the hands of pathologists and oncologists at the onset of a cancer diagnosis, we witnessed CGP-tested patients received biomarker-matched therapy at a higher rate, which often led to better outcomes.” \n\nCGP, which assesses hundreds of cancer biomarkers across various tumor types in a single test, can guide patients toward targeted treatments or immunotherapies that may not have been identified through more limited genomic testing approaches. This type of testing is increasingly being adopted due to its broad scope and faster turnaround times compared to sequential single-gene tests or small panels. However, barriers to access remain, including insurance coverage and other logistical challenges. \n\nFor payers, these results build evidence that a CGP approach prior to treatment initiation improves survival compared to conventional small-panel testing. “For evidence-driven coverage decisions, improved patient outcomes—particularly survival—are the key determinant, said John Fox, senior director of Market Access at Illumina. “These real-world results across multiple solid tumor types should empower plans to cover CGP as a first-line test.”\n\n“Patients who received a CGP test in this study did so free of charge,” Providence bioinformatics scientist and lead author of the study Alexa Dowdell, MS, said. “By removing the barrier that most often prevents patients from receiving this test, we were able to observe a sizeable cohort and witness the effectiveness of tumor molecular profiling and the precision therapies that often followed.” \n\nUsing a natural language processing-based approach developed by Microsoft Research collaborators, Providence clinical researchers were able to quickly and efficiently parse through large sets of publications, clinical trials, and electronic health records. These AI capabilities assisted Providence researchers with genomics interpretation and clinical trial matching in the molecular tumor boards.\n\n“These results further illustrate the paradigm shift in clinical practice in oncology,” said Swaroop Aradhya, head of Medical and Clinical Affairs at Illumina. “Patients are seeing better outcomes from precision treatments based on a tumor’s molecular profile compared to conventional approaches used to treat cancer.”\n\n###\n\nAbout Providence\n\nProvidence is a national, not-for-profit Catholic health system comprising a diverse family of organizations and driven by a belief that health is a human right.
