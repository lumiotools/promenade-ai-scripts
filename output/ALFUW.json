          "content": "CENTURION ACQUISITION CORP.\nPOLICY REGARDING INSIDER TRADING AND\nDISSEMINATION OF INSIDE INFORMATION\nEffective June 10, 2024\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis Policy Regarding Insider Trading and Dissemination of Inside Information (this\n“Policy”) describes the policy of Centurion Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) regarding:\n• the trading of securities while you are in possession of Inside Information (as defined\nbelow) (“insider trading”) about the Company or any other company; and\n• other misuse of material non-public information (“Inside Information”) of the\nCompany or any other company.\nYour obligations and potential liability under securities laws dealing with insider trading\nabuses are also outlined below.\nThis Policy provides an overview of the most significant aspects involved in insider trading.\nEvery director, officer and employee of the Company must read and retain this Policy.\nII. STATEMENT OF THE POLICY\nNo director, officer, employee or other Insider (as defined below) shall:\n• trade in securities of the Company or any other company while in possession of Inside\nInformation concerning the Company or such other company;\n• disseminate Inside Information of the Company or any other company to others (except\nfor legitimate Company purposes in accordance with Company communications\npolicies; provided that the disclosing person reasonably does not expect the recipient to\ntrade in securities, or disseminate the information to others who may trade in securities,\nwhile in possession of such Inside Information); or\n• engage in any other action or conduct to take advantage of Inside Information.\nThe prohibited dissemination of Inside Information includes the disclosure through written,\noral or electronic means to all persons or entities, including friends, family members, business\ncontacts or others.\nEven the appearance of improper conduct must be avoided to preserve the Company’s\nreputation for adhering to high ethical standards of conduct. Accordingly, conduct which merely\nsuggests the possibility of insider trading may be deemed by the Company, in its sole discretion,\nto be a violation of this Policy.\nIII. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING\nRule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nhas been determined by the courts to prohibit trading by an Insider (as defined below) of any\nsecurities (debt or equity) of a company on the basis of Inside Information about such company.\nLiability under Rule 10b-5 can apply to trading in the Company’s securities or the securities of any\nother company if one is in possession of Inside Information about the company whose securities\nare traded. The prohibition against insider trading applies to the Company’s officers,\ndirectors, employees and other Insiders at all times regardless of whether or not the Company\nis observing a scheduled or special “blackout” period.\nLiability under Rule 10b-5 may attach not only to Insiders who trade while in possession\nof Inside Information, but also, under certain circumstances, to (i) Insiders who disclose or tip\nInside Information (tippers) to third parties without trading themselves, and (ii) third parties (such\nas relatives, business associates or friends) who have received Inside Information from Insiders\n(tippees) and trade while in possession of that Inside Information.\nIV. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INSIDER TRADING\nIndividuals who trade on material non-public information (or tip information to others) can\nbe subject to an array of civil and criminal penalties. Violations are taken very seriously by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law in\nthis area. Potential sanctions include:\n• disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided and interest thereon;\n• a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;\n• a bar from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company;\n• a criminal fine (no matter how small the profit or the lack thereof) of up to $1 million;\nand\n• a jail term of up to ten years.\nThese penalties can apply even if the individual is not a director, officer or senior manager.\nIn addition to the potentially severe civil and criminal penalties for violation of the insider trading\nlaws, violation of this Policy may result in the imposition of Company sanctions, including\ndismissal. A conviction or finding of liability for insider trading can also result in individuals being\nbanned generally from employment in the securities or financial industries or other employment,\nand even a mere allegation of insider trading can result in severe harm to one’s professional and\npersonal reputation.\nA transaction that may be necessary or seem justifiable for independent reasons (including\na need to raise money for a personal financial emergency) is neither an exception to this Policy nor\na safeguard against prosecution for violation of insider trading laws.\nFor a company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate\nsteps to prevent illegal trading, a civil penalty of the greater of $1 million or three times the profit\ngained or loss avoided as a result of an employee’s violation and a criminal fine of up to $2.5\nmillion may be imposed. There are also likely to be stockholder lawsuits and adverse publicity\narising from such illegal conduct.\nV. WHO IS AN “INSIDER” FOR PURPOSES OF THE INSIDER TRADING\nPROHIBITIONS?\nAn “Insider” for purposes of insider trading law is any person who possesses Inside\nInformation; the status results from such possession and not simply a person’s position, if any, with\nthe Company. Accordingly, Insiders subject to liability for insider trading are not solely those\nexecutive officers and directors who are required to report their securities transactions of Company\ncommon stock under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and who are also often referred to as\n“insiders” for purposes of that law. The category of potential Insiders for purposes of insider trading\nlaw includes not only the Company’s directors, officers and employees, but also outside\nprofessional advisors and business consultants who have access to Inside Information prior to its\npublic release and absorption by the securities markets.\nVI. PERSONS COVERED BY THE POLICY\nThis Policy covers the directors, officers and employees of the Company, and outside\nprofessional advisors and business consultants of the Company who have access to Inside\nInformation of the Company, as well as their Family Members and Controlled Entities.\n“Family Members” include a person’s spouse, partner, financially dependent children,\nrelative, or other members of such person’s immediate household to whose support such person\ncontributes or whose investments such person controls.\n“Controlled Entities” include any legal entities controlled by a person, such as any\ncorporations, partnerships, or trusts.\nVII. INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY\nPersons subject to this Policy have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the\nconfidentiality of Inside Information and to not trade while in possession of Inside Information.\nEach individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that\nany Family Member or Controlled Entity also complies with this policy. In all cases, the\nresponsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of Inside Information rests\nwith that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the Administrator (as defined\nunder the caption “Administration of the Policy”) or any other employee or director pursuant to\nthis Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from\nliability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties and\ndisciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by this Policy or applicable\nsecurities laws, as described above in more detail under the heading “The Consequences of Insider\nTrading.”\nVIII. TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY\nThe trading covered by this Policy includes all types of transactions and securities,\nincluding common stock, options or warrants to purchase common stock, or any other type of\nsecurities, including (but not limited to) preferred stock, convertible debentures, as well as\nderivative securities that are issued by third parties, such as exchange-traded put or call options or\nswaps relating to securities of the Company or another company with respect to which an Insider\npossesses Inside Information.\nIX. WHAT IS MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION?\nMaterial information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider\nimportant in arriving at a decision to buy, sell or hold the securities of a company and/or would\nview its disclosure as significantly altering the total mix of information otherwise made available.\nNon-Public information is information that is not generally known to the public.\nExamples. Examples of non-public information that generally would be regarded as\nmaterial and thus Inside Information include:\n• financial information, such as revenues, expenses, earnings, new sales or investment\nreturns;\n• information about a transaction that will affect the financial condition or performance\nof the company in a significant manner, such as a pending or proposed merger,\nacquisition, tender offer, sale of assets, or disposition of a subsidiary, or entering into\nor terminating a significant contract;\n• earnings estimates;\n• a stock split or the offering of additional securities;\n• major litigation;\n• changes in senior management;\n• major new products; and\n• the gain or loss of a substantial customer.\nEither positive or negative information may be material. The foregoing list is not\nexhaustive; other types of information may be material at any particular time, depending upon all\nthe circumstances.\nX. TRADING\nThis Policy permits an Insider to trade securities beginning at the close of regular trading\non the second full Trading Day after all Inside Information has been disclosed to the public through\ngeneral release to the national news media, which will provide the securities markets a sufficient\nopportunity to absorb and evaluate the information.\n“Trading Day” means a day on which the principal U.S. stock exchange on which shares\nof the Company’s common stock are then listed is open for trading.\nFor example, if Inside Information (including quarterly or annual earnings) is disclosed at\n(a) 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on a Monday, then trading may commence after 4:00 p.m., Eastern\nTime, on Tuesday, (b) 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Monday, then trading may commence after\n4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday or (c) 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Monday, then trading\nmay commence after 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday.\nPlease refer to the paragraph below captioned “Additional Procedures” for additional\nrestrictions on trading.\nXI. TRANSACTIONS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS POLICY\nA. Bona Fide Gifts\nBona fide gifts are not transactions subject to this Policy, unless the person making the gift\nhas reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company securities while the person\nmaking the gift is aware of Inside Information or during a blackout period to which the person\nmaking the gift is subject; provided that bona fide gifts of Company securities by directors, officers\nwho have been designated by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) as “officers” for\npurposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (collectively with the directors, “Section 16 Reporting\nPersons”) and certain other employees who may be designated by the Administrator from time to\ntime (“Designated Individuals”) are subject to the pre-clearance procedures set forth below under\nthe caption “Additional Procedures.”\nB. Option Exercises\nThis Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee option acquired pursuant to the\nCompany’s plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has\nelected to have the Company withhold stock subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding\nrequirements; provided that such exercises by Section 16 Reporting Persons and Designated\nIndividuals are subject to the pre-clearance procedures set forth below under the caption\n“Additional Procedures.” This Policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-\nassisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the\ncash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.\nC. Restricted Stock Awards\nThis Policy does not apply to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you\nelect to have the Company withhold stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting\nof any restricted stock; provided that such exercise by Section 16 Reporting Persons and\nDesignated Individuals is subject to the pre-clearance procedures set forth below under the caption\n“Additional Procedures.” This Policy does apply, however, to any market sale of restricted stock.\nD. Mutual Funds\nTransactions in mutual funds that are invested in securities of the Company or another\ncompany with respect to which an Insider possesses Inside Information are not transactions subject\nto this Policy.\nE. Other Similar Transactions\nAny other purchase of Company securities from the Company or sales of Company\nsecurities to the Company are not subject to this Policy.\nF. Rule 10b5-1 Plans\nSecurities trading pursuant to contracts, plans or instructions complying with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1 Plans”) and entered into\nin good faith while the person entering into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan is not in possession of Inside\nInformation is not subject to this Policy, provided that the adoption and maintenance of any such\nRule 10b5-1 Plan by such person must be approved by the Administrator and must comply with\nthe requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1).\nXII. SPECIAL AND PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and/or the appearance of\nimproper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types of\ntransactions. Therefore any persons covered by this Policy must comply with the following:\nA. Hedging Transactions\nHedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible\nmechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards,\nequity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Such hedging transactions may permit a director, officer\nor employee to continue to own Company securities obtained through employee benefit plans or\notherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director,\nofficer or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company’s other stockholders.\nTherefore, directors, officers and employees, as well as their Family Members and Controlled\nEntities, are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions.\nB. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities\nIn order to avoid a margin sale or foreclosure sale at a time when a pledgor, who is a\nCompany director, officer or employee, or their Family Members or Controlled Entities, is aware\nof Inside Information or otherwise is not permitted to trade Company securities due to a blackout\nperiod, no Company director, officer or employee, or their Family Members or Controlled Entities,\nmay hold Company securities in a margin account or otherwise pledge (or hypothecate) Company\nsecurities as collateral for a loan without first obtaining prior approval from the Administrator. Pre-\nclearance is required for such transactions because Company securities held in a margin account\nmay be sold by the broker without the customer’s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin\ncall and Company securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in\nforeclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Any Company director, officer or employee, or\ntheir Family Members or Controlled Entities, preparing to pledge Company securities or hold such\nsecurities in a margin account must submit a request for approval to the Administrator at least two\nweeks prior to the proposed execution of documents evidencing the proposed pledge or margin\naccount. In its request, such Company director, officer or employee, or their Family Members or\nControlled Entities, shall:\n• enclose copies of the governing documents evidencing the proposed pledge or margin\naccount, which governing documents must provide such person with the opportunity to\nsubstitute or provide additional collateral or to repay the loan before the pledged\nCompany securities may be sold; and\n• undertake to the Company (in form and manner satisfactory to the Administrator and\nthe Company) (i) to maintain adequate financial capacity to repay the loan or cover the\nmargin call, as applicable, without resort to the pledged Company securities and (ii) to\nsubstitute or provide additional collateral or repay the loan in the event of a borrower\ndefault or margin call, as applicable, at a time when such person is aware of Inside\nInformation or otherwise is not permitted to trade Company securities due to a blackout\nperiod.\nThe above is not meant to restrict the rehypothecation or lending of securities held in a\nbrokerage account; provided that the securities are permitted to be held in such account in\naccordance with this Policy.\nXIII. ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nThe Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in the\nadministration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while\nin possession of Inside Information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These\nadditional procedures are applicable only to those individuals described below.\nA. Pre-Clearance Procedures\nSection 16 Reporting Persons and Designated Individuals, as well as their Family Members\nand Controlled Entities, may not engage in any transaction in Company securities without first\nobtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the Administrator in order to determine compliance\nwith this Policy, insider trading laws, Section 16 of the Exchange Act and\nRule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”). A person\nrequesting pre-clearance should submit the request to the Administrator (and, in the case of a\nrequest by the Chief Executive Officer, also notify the Chief Financial Officer) at least two business\ndays in advance of the proposed transaction. The Administrator may determine not to permit the\ntransaction if it is not in compliance this Policy, insider trading laws, Section 16 of the Exchange\nAct or Rule 144. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is\ndenied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company securities, and\nshould not inform any other person of the restriction.\nWhen a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether\nhe or she may be aware of any Inside Information about the Company, and should describe fully\nthose circumstances to the Administrator. If the requestor is a Section 16 insider, the requestor\nshould also indicate whether he or she has effected any non-exempt “opposite-way” transactions\nwithin the past six months, and should be prepared to report the proposed transaction on an\nappropriate Form 4 or Form 5. The requestor should also be prepared to comply with Rule 144 and\nfile Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale.\nB. Special Blackout Periods\nFrom time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by\nonly a few directors, officers and/or employees. So long as the event remains material and\nnonpublic, the persons with knowledge of the event who are designated by the Administrator may\nnot trade Company securities. In that situation, the Administrator may notify these persons that\nthey should not trade in the Company’s securities, without disclosing the reason for the restriction.\nThe existence of an event-specific blackout period or extension of a blackout period may not be\nannounced to the Company as a whole, and should not be communicated to any other person. Even\nif the Administrator has not designated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-\nspecific restriction, you should not trade while aware of Inside Information.\nXIV. POST-TERMINATION TRANSACTIONS\nIf an individual is in possession of Inside Information or subject to any blackout period or\nother Company-imposed trading restrictions when his or her service terminates, that individual\nmay not trade in Company securities until that information has become public, is no longer material\nor such blackout period or Company-imposed trading restriction has expired.\nXV. ADMINISTRATION OF THIS POLICY\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer, or in his absence the Chief Financial Officer, or\nwith respect to matters involving the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial\nOfficer (the “Administrator”), shall be responsible for administration of this Policy, including the\nmatters for which the Administrator is specifically designated herein as administering or deciding\nand all other matters. All determinations and interpretations by the Administrator shall be subject\nto review by the Audit Committee, whose determinations shall be final.\nXVI. COMPANY ASSISTANCE / REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS\nAny person who has any questions about this Policy or about specific transactions may\nobtain additional guidance from the Administrator. You should contact the Administrator\nimmediately if you know or have reason to believe that this Policy has been or is about to be\nviolated."
