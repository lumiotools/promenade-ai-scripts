The annual list recognizes the world’s most influential leaders driving business climate action.\n\n“I am honored to be recognized alongside so many inspiring leaders who deeply care about the future of our planet and put action behind their words,” said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell. “I am so proud of the Sunrun team’s work to accelerate the customer-led revolution to a more affordable, resilient, and energy independent future for Americans. I look forward to deepening our work toward a cleaner energy system with customers, partners, and policymakers. There’s no time to waste!”\n\nDuring Powell’s three-year tenure at Sunrun, the company has rapidly grown its impact, adding over 400,000 new customers and achieving a nearly 500% increase in battery installations with 112,000 new storage customers. This growth has contributed to generating approximately 21 billion kilowatt-hours of solar energy, helping to enable the avoidance of nearly 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere.\n\n“Mary is a proven innovator with an ambitious energy vision that's fueled by her love of people and the planet,” said Colby Hastings, Director of Residential Energy at Tesla. “During her time as a utility executive, she was one of the first to embrace new technologies like Tesla Powerwall and push boundaries in the energy system to create a more resilient, affordable grid. She has also been a key force behind Sunrun and Tesla’s continued collaboration, driving towards the vision that home storage and solar can offer families a better energy experience while providing a cleaner future for everyone.”\n\nPowell’s focus on customer obsession and creating a differentiated customer experience in home energy has helped Sunrun become the first residential storage-plus-solar company to reach over 1 million customers. Her strategic shift to a storage-first model has enabled Sunrun to continue to expand its share of all residential storage installations in the U.S. and positioned the company to lead on creating a more economical and sustainable grid for all.\n\n“Mary has long been a transformative figure in the energy industry, driving incredible momentum toward her mission for Sunrun to deliver resilient, affordable clean energy to millions of families across the country,” said Alan D. Ferber, Lead Independent Director on Sunrun’s Board of Directors. “Her vision at Sunrun has always been to connect households to the cleanest energy on earth by becoming a multi-product, clean energy lifestyle company—a vision that creates meaningful benefits for families, communities, and grid operators.”\n\nPowell’s leadership has earned her numerous accolades, including being named to Forbes’ 50 Sustainability Leaders 2024 list, Utility Dive’s 2019 Utility Executive of the Year, Fast Company’s 100 Most Creative People and Fast 50 Leaders in America lists, and the prestigious Rachel Carson Award for environmental impact.\n\nSee the full list: [https://time.com/time100-climate ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2fVaGK2InHA0NJ4r6hyvlu45qB2aq7VaSgMezoJIDNiwFWxHlZu4io8uVgFZuPyVeKL3-ZVMyE7Gh0Fm6idxuIjIBw_uNw_57B0GhEr1GhVwx28MJZ8JgX28gLazK9Mcc8DDVkjz1XbTTw1CBulRhgDpFEXn0FWYV-ZI3eTY9k1xMzTewmHX0WQji-xILxvCD47xIgzOIx9VwhB-5e36xVJercIcFN4JvBuSard6cAgP2yZ0vWeC5CgQQeqm-vJThBBYtoPD9eUcUMAADiS6Y-uzSk5Hjb0L-F0DqfY5098j5aohorpk2RuXpdAy5gA-K950gZu0pDuLqnulOQF9KCZuGE2rPV6lBiNkfsBcYlgwBZ0cB5iY5OdcmTPTm8aeoAHPIMBNT4cu3UFo0IgSi4aEf2GBxCsAopKXwMqbarT1cM3XjLmUxZvP8BnATfhv5uQPmeR8GzWb1TQjXwwDYg_yYtCNblPteKj3Xw8kePVV6QiwxKDyJFaD0g6fgl64DLnQMbanIGYtrKGU96tieo2L5bMq9RlecDdO3ExL1RwS8zwP1JXJ94SwOrayeK8cTvBSFEBxSsI40LdQYTq3PDNFtldmgve6pS2_XTeitfUAeI6fc3eEOj7IdC8pN4ycf7c-xWSXN4a03_6cjztwyg== \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n**About Sunrun** Sunrun Inc.

In the third quarter, we again set new records for both storage installation attachment rates and delivered solid quarter-over-quarter growth for solar installations while reporting higher Net Subscriber Values,” **said Mary Powell, Sunrun’s Chief Executive Officer.** “The team delivered the second consecutive quarter of positive Cash Generation. Our primary focus continues to be expanding our differentiation for customers and remaining a disciplined, margin-focused leader that drives meaningful Cash Generation.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we delivered on our commitments for solar and storage installations, margin expansion and Cash Generation. Net Subscriber Value was the highest level the company has ever reported, a testament to our margin-focused and disciplined growth strategy,” **said Danny Abajian, Sunrun’s Chief Financial Officer.** “We have a strong balance sheet with no near-term corporate debt maturities, having extended our recourse working capital facility maturity to March 2027, and as of today, we have reduced parent debt by over $100 million since March. As we increase our Cash Generation, we will continue to allocate excess unrestricted cash to further reduce parent recourse debt and are committed to a capital allocation strategy beyond this initial de-leveraging period that drives significant shareholder value.”\n\n**Third Quarter Updates**\n\n  * _Storage Attachment Rates Reach 60%_ : Storage attachment rates on installations reached 60% in Q3, up from 33% in the prior-year period, with 336 Megawatt hours installed during the quarter. Sunrun has installed more than 135,000 solar and storage systems, representing over 2.1 Gigawatt hours of stored energy capacity.\n  * _Continued Momentum in New Homes Business:_ Sunrun is seeing strong traction in its new homes division. Sunrun is working with 9 of the top 10 new home builders in California, and over half of the top 20 home builders in the US. In September, Sunrun signed a multi-year exclusive agreement with Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) in California. While this division represents less than 5% of our volumes currently, we expect this division to grow at least 50% next year. Home builders appreciate our leading subscription offerings, service commitments, and long track record. Our subscription offering can provide new home buyers with immediate value, including savings on energy and resiliency from backup storage systems, without increasing the cost of purchasing the home.\n  * _Improving Grid Stability with Virtual Power Plants:_ In Q3, Sunrun introduced several new virtual power plant programs to help meet peak demand and enhance grid stability. In New York, Sunrun activated the state’s largest residential virtual power plant in collaboration with Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc., a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED). Over 300 solar-plus-storage systems provided stored solar energy during multiple peak demand events this summer, strengthening grid reliability. Participating customers received a free or heavily discounted home battery in exchange for their commitment to the 10-year program, while Sunrun received upfront payments from O&R based on installed battery capacity. In Maryland, Sunrun launched the nation’s first vehicle-to-home virtual power plant, partnering with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC), to utilize a small group of customer-owned Ford F-150 Lightnings. BGE was awarded grant funding from the Department of Energy to create the program, and Sunrun helped develop and administer it. Participating customers can earn several hundred dollars by sharing energy from their F-150 Lightning trucks. In Texas, Sunrun partnered with Tesla Electric and Vistra on two virtual power plants. Still growing, the Tesla Electric program has already enrolled more than 150 Sunrun customers, leveraging home batteries to provide reserves during peak consumption. Customers will receive an annual payment, currently set at $400 per Powerwall for 2024, while Sunrun earns recurring revenue through the program. The Vistra partnership also offers customers financial incentives and credits for sharing stored energy with the grid when demand is highest.\n  * _Continued Strong Capital Markets Execution:_ In September, Sunrun closed a $365 million securitization of residential solar and battery systems, its fourth securitization placed in 2024. The transaction was structured with two separate classes of publicly placed A+ rated notes. The weighted average spread was 235 basis points and the weighted average yield was 5.87%. The initial balance of the Class A notes represents a 73.8% advance rate on the Securitization Share of ADSAB (present value using a 6% discount rate). Similar to prior transactions, Sunrun raised additional capital in a subordinated non-recourse financing, which increased the cumulative advance rate to above 80% as measured against the initial Contracted Subscriber Value of the portfolio. Also, in July, Sunrun expanded its non-recourse warehouse lending facility by $280 million to $2,630 million in commitments, matching the growing scale of Sunrun’s business.\n  * _Extended Maturity of Recourse Working Capital Facility and Reduced Parent Leverage Through Continued 2026 Convertible Note Repurchases:_ We extended the maturity of our recourse Working Capital Facility to March 2027 (from November 2025) as we were in compliance with the provisions in the agreement, which calls for having funds in a restricted reserve account equal to the amount of our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes. We continue to reduce parent leverage with continued repurchasing of our 2026 Convertible Notes. To date, we have repurchased $317 million of these notes, leaving $83 million of the notes outstanding as of today. As of September 30, 2024 the outstanding balance on the 2026 Convertible Notes was $133.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Key Operating Metrics**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Customer Additions were 31,910 including 30,348 Subscriber Additions. As of September 30, 2024, Sunrun had 1,015,910 Customers, including 858,477 Subscribers. Customers grew 12% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue from Subscribers was approximately $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Average Contract Life Remaining of Subscribers was 17.6 years as of September 30, 2024.\n\nSubscriber Value was $51,223 in the third quarter of 2024, a 9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. Creation Cost was $36,591 in the third quarter of 2024, a 2% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet Subscriber Value was $14,632 in the third quarter of 2024. Total Value Generated was $444 million in the third quarter of 2024. On a pro-forma basis assuming a 7.1% discount rate, consistent with capital costs observed in the quarter, Subscriber Value was $47,335 and Net Subscriber Value was $10,744 in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGross Earning Assets as of September 30, 2024, were $16.8 billion. Net Earning Assets were $6.2 billion, which included $1,011 million in Total Cash, as of September 30, 2024.\n\nCash Generation was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, the second consecutive quarter of positive Cash Generation.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed was 336.3 Megawatt hours in the third quarter of 2024, a 92% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed was 229.7 Megawatts in the third quarter of 2024, an 11% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Included in this figure is 220.7 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity was 7,288 Megawatts as of September 30, 2024. Included in this figure is 6,204 Megawatts of Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNetworked Storage Capacity was 2.1 Gigawatt hours as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe solar energy systems we deployed in Q3 are expected to offset the emission of 4.7 million metric tons of CO2 over the next thirty years. Over the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Sunrun’s systems are estimated to have offset 4.1 million metric tons of CO2.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nManagement is reiterating Cash Generation guidance of $350 million to $600 million for the full-year 2025.\n\nManagement is reiterating guidance for Cash Generation of $50 million to $125 million in Q4.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 320 to 350 Megawatt hours in Q4, reflecting 52% growth at the midpoint compared to the prior year. For the full-year 2024, this implies 100% growth at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 240 to 250 Megawatts in Q4, reflecting 8% growth at the midpoint compared to the prior year, and 7% growth at the midpoint compared to Q3. For the full-year 2024, this implies a decline of 17% at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nNet Subscriber Value is expected to increase in Q4 compared to Q3.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $537.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, down $26.0 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2023. Customer agreements and incentives revenue was $405.9 million, an increase of $89.3 million, or 28%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Solar energy systems and product sales revenue was $131.3 million, a decrease of $115.3 million, or 47%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increasing mix of Subscribers results in less upfront revenue recognition, as revenue is recognized over the life of the Customer Agreement, which is typically 20 or 25 years.\n\nTotal cost of revenue was $433.7 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were $665.0 million, a decrease of 111% year-over-year, on a pro-forma basis to exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment and amortization of intangible assets, which were incurred in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $83.8 million, or $0.37 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Financing Activities**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, closed transactions and executed term sheets provide us with expected tax equity to fund approximately 272 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers beyond what was deployed through September 30, 2024. Sunrun also had $907 million available in its non-recourse senior revolving warehouse facility at the end of Q3 to fund over 318 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nSunrun is hosting a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and business outlook at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, November 7, 2024.

Financial Metrics**\n\nThe following operating metrics are used by management to evaluate the performance of the business. Management believes these metrics, when taken together with other information contained in our filings with the SEC and within this press release, provide investors with helpful information to determine the economic performance of the business activities in a period that would otherwise not be observable from historic GAAP measures. Management believes that it is helpful to investors to evaluate the present value of cash flows expected from subscribers over the full expected relationship with such subscribers (“Subscriber Value”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below) in comparison to the costs associated with adding these customers, regardless of whether or not the costs are expensed or capitalized in the period (“Creation Cost”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes that Subscriber Value, Creation Costs, and Total Value Generated are useful metrics for investors because they present an unlevered view of all of the costs associated with new customers in a period compared to the expected future cash flows from these customers over a 30-year period, based on contracted pricing terms with its customers, which is not observable in any current or historic GAAP-derived metric. Management believes it is useful for investors to also evaluate the future expected cash flows from all customers that have been deployed through the respective measurement date, less estimated costs to maintain such systems and estimated distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors (“Gross Earning Assets”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes Gross Earning Assets is useful for management and investors because it represents the remaining future expected cash flows from existing customers, which is not a current or historic GAAP-derived measure.\n\nVarious assumptions are made when calculating these metrics. Both Subscriber Value and Gross Earning Assets utilize a 6% rate to discount future cash flows to the present period. Furthermore, these metrics assume that customers renew after the initial contract period at a rate equal to 90% of the rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. For Customer Agreements with 25-year initial contract terms, a 5-year renewal period is assumed. For a 20-year initial contract term, a 10-year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system. Estimated cost of servicing assets has been deducted and is estimated based on the service agreements underlying each fund.\n\n**_In-period volume metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \nCustomer Additions | 31,910  \nSubscriber Additions (included within Customer Additions) | 30,348  \nSolar Energy Capacity Installed (in Megawatts) | 229.7  \nSolar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers (in Megawatts) | 220.7  \nStorage Capacity Installed (in Megawatt hours) | 336.3  \n**_In-period value creation metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \nSubscriber Value Contracted Period | $ | 47,557  \nSubscriber Value Renewal Period | $ | 3,666  \nSubscriber Value | $ | 51,223  \nCreation Cost | $ | 36,591  \nNet Subscriber Value | $ | 14,632  \nTotal Value Generated (in millions) | $ | 444.1  \n**_In-period environmental impact metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \nPositive Environmental Impact from Customers (over trailing twelve months, in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) | 4.1  \nPositive Expected Lifetime Environmental Impact from Customer Additions (in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) | 4.7  \n**_Period-end metrics:_** | **September 30, 2024**  \nCustomers | 1,015,910  \nSubscribers (subset of Customers) | 858,477  \nHouseholds Served in Low-Income Multifamily Properties | 19,321  \nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity (in Megawatts) | 7,288  \nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers (in Megawatts) | 6,204  \nNetworked Storage Capacity (in Megawatt hours) | 2,133  \nAnnual Recurring Revenue (in millions) | $ | 1,517  \nAverage Contract Life Remaining (in years) | 17.6  \nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period (in millions) | $ | 12,964  \nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period (in millions) | $ | 3,815  \nGross Earning Assets (in millions) | $ | 16,780  \nNet Earning Assets (in millions) | $ | 6,231  \n  \n_Figures presented above may not sum due to rounding. For adjustments related to Subscriber Value and Creation Cost, please see the supplemental Creation Cost and Net Subscriber Value calculation memo for each applicable period, which is available on investors.sunrun.com._\n\n**Definitions**\n\n**Deployments** represent solar or storage systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed, subject to final inspection, or (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems).\n\n**Customer Agreements** refer to, collectively, solar or storage power purchase agreements and leases.\n\n**Subscriber Additions** represent the number of Deployments in the period that are subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\n**Customer Additions** represent the number of Deployments in the period.\n\n**Solar Energy Capacity Installed** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period.\n\n**Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period that are subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\n**Storage Capacity Installed** represents the aggregate megawatt hour capacity of storage systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period.\n\n**Creation Cost** represents the sum of certain operating expenses and capital expenditures incurred divided by applicable Customer Additions and Subscriber Additions in the period. Creation Cost is comprised of (i) installation costs, which includes the increase in gross solar energy system assets and the cost of customer agreement revenue, excluding depreciation expense of fixed solar assets, and operating and maintenance expenses associated with existing Subscribers, plus (ii) sales and marketing costs, including increases to the gross capitalized costs to obtain contracts, net of the amortization expense of the costs to obtain contracts, plus (iii) general and administrative costs, and less (iv) the gross profit derived from selling systems to customers under sale agreements and Sunrun’s product distribution and lead generation businesses. Creation Cost excludes stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and research and development expenses, along with other items the company deems to be non-recurring or extraordinary in nature. The gross margin derived from solar energy systems and product sales is included as an offset to Creation Cost since these sales are ancillary to the overall business model and lowers our overall cost of business. The sales, marketing, general and administrative costs in Creation Costs is inclusive of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities related to the entire business, including solar energy system and product sales. As such, by including the gross margin on solar energy system and product sales as a contra cost, the value of all activities of the Company’s segment are represented in the Net Subscriber Value.\n\n**Subscriber Value** represents the per subscriber value of upfront and future cash flows (discounted at 6%) from Subscriber Additions in the period, including expected payments from customers as set forth in Customer Agreements, net proceeds from tax equity finance partners, payments from utility incentive and state rebate programs, contracted net grid service program cash flows, projected future cash flows from solar energy renewable energy credit sales, less estimated operating and maintenance costs to service the systems and replace equipment, consistent with estimates by independent engineers, over the initial term of the Customer Agreements and estimated renewal period. For Customer Agreements with 25 year initial contract terms, a 5 year renewal period is assumed. For a 20 year initial contract term, a 10 year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system.\n\n**Net Subscriber Value** represents Subscriber Value less Creation Cost.\n\n**Total Value Generated** represents Net Subscriber Value multiplied by Subscriber Additions.\n\n**Customers** represent the cumulative number of Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Subscribers** represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as Deployments through the measurement date.\n\n**Networked Solar Energy Capacity** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date, that have been subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\n**Networked Storage Capacity** represents the aggregate megawatt hour capacity of our storage systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets** is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period** represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 6%) that we would receive from Subscribers in future periods as set forth in Customer Agreements, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from tax equity partners, government incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utilities or grid operators.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period** is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer’s contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\n**Net Earning Assets** represents Gross Earning Assets, plus total cash, less adjusted debt and less pass-through financing obligations, as of the same measurement date. Debt is adjusted to exclude a pro-rata share of non-recourse debt associated with funds with project equity structures along with debt associated with the company’s ITC safe harboring facility. Because estimated cash distributions to our project equity partners are deducted from Gross Earning Assets, a proportional share of the corresponding project level non-recourse debt is deducted from Net Earning Assets, as such debt would be serviced from cash flows already excluded from Gross Earning Assets.\n\n**Cash Generation** is calculated using the change in our unrestricted cash balance from our consolidated balance sheet, less net proceeds (or plus net repayments) from all recourse debt (inclusive of convertible debt), and less any primary equity issuances or net proceeds derived from employee stock award activity (or plus any stock buybacks or dividends paid to common stockholders) as presented on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company expects to continue to raise tax equity and asset-level non-recourse debt to fund growth, and as such, these sources of cash are included in the definition of Cash Generation. Cash Generation also excludes long-term asset or business divestitures and equity investments in external non-consolidated businesses (or less dividends or distributions received in connection with such equity investments).

(O&R), a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED), one of the nation’s largest investor-owned energy companies, have successfully activated New York’s largest residential power plant using more than 300 solar-plus-storage systems. During dozens of peak electricity demand events this summer, the home batteries supplied stored solar energy to help stabilize the electric grid.\n\nThe Sunrun-managed power plant was initiated by O&R and approved as a demonstration project by the New York State Public Service Commission. The year-round program supports New York’s transition to clean and reliable energy and helps the state reach its nation-leading storage and electrification goals. Under this program, Sunrun synchronizes the discharging of the participating batteries to deliver stored solar power to reduce stress on the electric grid during times of peak energy usage. The solar-plus-storage systems also provide a source of backup power to the homes of participating customers.\n\n“This is an important step toward the future of fortifying New York’s energy grid, utilizing innovation to build a more affordable and reliable way to deliver power. We are excited to see residents of New York benefit from the sharing of stored solar power and know this partnership with Orange and Rockland will show the path forward for the rest of the state,” said CEO of Sunrun, Mary Powell.\n\n“The creation of this virtual power plant unlocks incredible benefits to the electric grid that will provide our customers with the clean and reliable energy that they expect and deserve,” said Andre Wellington, O&R director of Distributed Resource Integration. “Home solar-plus-storage is an innovative, flexible resource that can be called upon during times of stress on our electric system and O&R is happy to be part of this opportunity to advance New York State’s clean energy goals.”\n\nEnrolled customers received a free or heavily discounted home battery in exchange for participating in the 10-year program to help the resiliency of the electric grid. Sunrun receives an upfront payment from O&R based on the battery capacity installed, which allows Sunrun to offer the battery for free or at a heavily discounted price to customers. Customers will also benefit from consuming their own stored solar power and from utility bill credits for the excess energy they supply to the electric grid. Even when O&R dispatches the batteries for load relief, customers’ batteries will still retain 20% or more of the stored solar power to provide their homes with backup power in the event of a local power outage.\n\n“We quickly signed up once we learned that a Sunrun solar and battery system could protect our home from outages while also bolstering the grid for our community,” said Joseph Ortiz, a Sunrun and O&R customer in Rockland County. “It’s gratifying to know that—without us even lifting a finger—our home is supplying clean solar energy back to the grid to benefit everyone.”\n\nWith more than 1 million customers and 116,000 installed storage systems, Sunrun is the nation’s largest developer of residential clean energy systems. Sunrun is responsible for nearly half of all new home battery installations in the country. Sunrun operates more than a dozen power plants across the country, including the nation’s largest single-owner virtual power plant.\n\n**About Sunrun** Sunrun Inc.

Making energy security affordable by helping families across America tap into and store the cleanest energy on earth is our mission.”\n\n“Good Housekeeping is proud to support a company like Sunrun that has helped bring rooftop solar, along with an array of other energy-saving solutions, to so many homeowners nationwide,” said Dan DiClerico, Director of Home Improvement and Outdoor at the Good Housekeeping Institute.\n\nGood Housekeeping called Sunrun’s subscription service “Attainable Rooftop Solar” because it allows customers to enjoy the benefits of home solar and storage with no upfront costs.\n\n“That’s why we like so-called solar-as-service models, whereby homeowners lease rooftop panels and all the accessories (mounting rack, inverter, electrical cables, etc.) through a solar company that also handles the installation and maintenance,” Good Housekeeping said. “Sunrun invented the concept in 2007, and it’s still the market leader.”\n\nAs severe weather and grid instability make power outages more frequent, Sunrun’s solar-plus-storage systems provide families with peace of mind that they can seamlessly keep their entire homes energized—even during prolonged blackouts.\n\nSunrun’s award-winning service not only benefits households, but also entire communities through virtual power plant programs in certain markets. By sharing their stored solar power back to the grid during peak times, Sunrun customers are compensated for bolstering the grid, reducing power outages, and helping control utility costs for all ratepayers.\n\nSunrun customers overwhelmingly choose the subscription service because it allows them to generate and store their own clean power with a predictable monthly payment. In addition, Sunrun’s subscriptions include 24/7 system monitoring, 25-year free maintenance and system repairs, 10-year workmanship warranty, and an industry-leading Performance Guarantee.\n\n“We also like the add-on components available through Sunrun, including backup battery storage and a smart electrical panel that gives homeowners even more ways to reduce their energy usage,” Good Housekeeping added.\n\nFounded in 1885, Good Housekeeping is a leading lifestyle media brand that currently inspires a monthly audience of 40-plus million readers. To find the best products and services for its 2025 Home Renovation Awards, Good Housekeeping spent a combined 10,000 hours getting hands-on with every submission. Much of the work took place in the Home Improvement & Outdoor Lab at the Good Housekeeping Institute, evaluating factors like performance, safety and durability. Good Housekeeping also brought in outside judges, a trio of professionals with decades of experience in their respective fields, to get their expert take.\n\n**About Sunrun** Sunrun Inc.

In the third quarter, we again set new records for both storage installation attachment rates and delivered solid quarter-over-quarter growth for solar installations while reporting higher Net Subscriber Values,” **said Mary Powell, Sunrun’s Chief Executive Officer.** “The team delivered the second consecutive quarter of positive Cash Generation. Our primary focus continues to be expanding our differentiation for customers and remaining a disciplined, margin-focused leader that drives meaningful Cash Generation.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we delivered on our commitments for solar and storage installations, margin expansion and Cash Generation. Net Subscriber Value was the highest level the company has ever reported, a testament to our margin-focused and disciplined growth strategy,” **said Danny Abajian, Sunrun’s Chief Financial Officer.** “We have a strong balance sheet with no near-term corporate debt maturities, having extended our recourse working capital facility maturity to March 2027, and as of today, we have reduced parent debt by over $100 million since March. As we increase our Cash Generation, we will continue to allocate excess unrestricted cash to further reduce parent recourse debt and are committed to a capital allocation strategy beyond this initial de-leveraging period that drives significant shareholder value.”\n\n**Third Quarter Updates**\n\n  * _Storage Attachment Rates Reach 60%_ : Storage attachment rates on installations reached 60% in Q3, up from 33% in the prior-year period, with 336 Megawatt hours installed during the quarter. Sunrun has installed more than 135,000 solar and storage systems, representing over 2.1 Gigawatt hours of stored energy capacity.\n  * _Continued Momentum in New Homes Business:_ Sunrun is seeing strong traction in its new homes division. Sunrun is working with 9 of the top 10 new home builders in California, and over half of the top 20 home builders in the US. In September, Sunrun signed a multi-year exclusive agreement with Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) in California. While this division represents less than 5% of our volumes currently, we expect this division to grow at least 50% next year. Home builders appreciate our leading subscription offerings, service commitments, and long track record. Our subscription offering can provide new home buyers with immediate value, including savings on energy and resiliency from backup storage systems, without increasing the cost of purchasing the home.\n  * _Improving Grid Stability with Virtual Power Plants:_ In Q3, Sunrun introduced several new virtual power plant programs to help meet peak demand and enhance grid stability. In New York, Sunrun activated the state’s largest residential virtual power plant in collaboration with Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc., a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED). Over 300 solar-plus-storage systems provided stored solar energy during multiple peak demand events this summer, strengthening grid reliability. Participating customers received a free or heavily discounted home battery in exchange for their commitment to the 10-year program, while Sunrun received upfront payments from O&R based on installed battery capacity. In Maryland, Sunrun launched the nation’s first vehicle-to-home virtual power plant, partnering with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC), to utilize a small group of customer-owned Ford F-150 Lightnings. BGE was awarded grant funding from the Department of Energy to create the program, and Sunrun helped develop and administer it. Participating customers can earn several hundred dollars by sharing energy from their F-150 Lightning trucks. In Texas, Sunrun partnered with Tesla Electric and Vistra on two virtual power plants. Still growing, the Tesla Electric program has already enrolled more than 150 Sunrun customers, leveraging home batteries to provide reserves during peak consumption. Customers will receive an annual payment, currently set at $400 per Powerwall for 2024, while Sunrun earns recurring revenue through the program. The Vistra partnership also offers customers financial incentives and credits for sharing stored energy with the grid when demand is highest.\n  * _Continued Strong Capital Markets Execution:_ In September, Sunrun closed a $365 million securitization of residential solar and battery systems, its fourth securitization placed in 2024. The transaction was structured with two separate classes of publicly placed A+ rated notes. The weighted average spread was 235 basis points and the weighted average yield was 5.87%. The initial balance of the Class A notes represents a 73.8% advance rate on the Securitization Share of ADSAB (present value using a 6% discount rate). Similar to prior transactions, Sunrun raised additional capital in a subordinated non-recourse financing, which increased the cumulative advance rate to above 80% as measured against the initial Contracted Subscriber Value of the portfolio. Also, in July, Sunrun expanded its non-recourse warehouse lending facility by $280 million to $2,630 million in commitments, matching the growing scale of Sunrun’s business.\n  * _Extended Maturity of Recourse Working Capital Facility and Reduced Parent Leverage Through Continued 2026 Convertible Note Repurchases:_ We extended the maturity of our recourse Working Capital Facility to March 2027 (from November 2025) as we were in compliance with the provisions in the agreement, which calls for having funds in a restricted reserve account equal to the amount of our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes. We continue to reduce parent leverage with continued repurchasing of our 2026 Convertible Notes. To date, we have repurchased $317 million of these notes, leaving $83 million of the notes outstanding as of today. As of September 30, 2024 the outstanding balance on the 2026 Convertible Notes was $133.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Key Operating Metrics**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Customer Additions were 31,910 including 30,348 Subscriber Additions. As of September 30, 2024, Sunrun had 1,015,910 Customers, including 858,477 Subscribers. Customers grew 12% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue from Subscribers was approximately $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Average Contract Life Remaining of Subscribers was 17.6 years as of September 30, 2024.\n\nSubscriber Value was $51,223 in the third quarter of 2024, a 9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. Creation Cost was $36,591 in the third quarter of 2024, a 2% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet Subscriber Value was $14,632 in the third quarter of 2024. Total Value Generated was $444 million in the third quarter of 2024. On a pro-forma basis assuming a 7.1% discount rate, consistent with capital costs observed in the quarter, Subscriber Value was $47,335 and Net Subscriber Value was $10,744 in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGross Earning Assets as of September 30, 2024, were $16.8 billion. Net Earning Assets were $6.2 billion, which included $1,011 million in Total Cash, as of September 30, 2024.\n\nCash Generation was $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, the second consecutive quarter of positive Cash Generation.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed was 336.3 Megawatt hours in the third quarter of 2024, a 92% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed was 229.7 Megawatts in the third quarter of 2024, an 11% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Included in this figure is 220.7 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity was 7,288 Megawatts as of September 30, 2024. Included in this figure is 6,204 Megawatts of Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNetworked Storage Capacity was 2.1 Gigawatt hours as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe solar energy systems we deployed in Q3 are expected to offset the emission of 4.7 million metric tons of CO2 over the next thirty years. Over the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Sunrun’s systems are estimated to have offset 4.1 million metric tons of CO2.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nManagement is reiterating Cash Generation guidance of $350 million to $600 million for the full-year 2025.\n\nManagement is reiterating guidance for Cash Generation of $50 million to $125 million in Q4.\n\nStorage Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 320 to 350 Megawatt hours in Q4, reflecting 52% growth at the midpoint compared to the prior year. For the full-year 2024, this implies 100% growth at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nSolar Energy Capacity Installed is expected to be in a range of 240 to 250 Megawatts in Q4, reflecting 8% growth at the midpoint compared to the prior year, and 7% growth at the midpoint compared to Q3. For the full-year 2024, this implies a decline of 17% at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nNet Subscriber Value is expected to increase in Q4 compared to Q3.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $537.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, down $26.0 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2023. Customer agreements and incentives revenue was $405.9 million, an increase of $89.3 million, or 28%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Solar energy systems and product sales revenue was $131.3 million, a decrease of $115.3 million, or 47%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increasing mix of Subscribers results in less upfront revenue recognition, as revenue is recognized over the life of the Customer Agreement, which is typically 20 or 25 years.\n\nTotal cost of revenue was $433.7 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were $665.0 million, a decrease of 111% year-over-year, on a pro-forma basis to exclude a non-cash goodwill impairment and amortization of intangible assets, which were incurred in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $83.8 million, or $0.37 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Financing Activities**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, closed transactions and executed term sheets provide us with expected tax equity to fund approximately 272 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers beyond what was deployed through September 30, 2024. Sunrun also had $907 million available in its non-recourse senior revolving warehouse facility at the end of Q3 to fund over 318 Megawatts of Solar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nSunrun is hosting a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and business outlook at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, November 7, 2024.

Financial Metrics**\n\nThe following operating metrics are used by management to evaluate the performance of the business. Management believes these metrics, when taken together with other information contained in our filings with the SEC and within this press release, provide investors with helpful information to determine the economic performance of the business activities in a period that would otherwise not be observable from historic GAAP measures. Management believes that it is helpful to investors to evaluate the present value of cash flows expected from subscribers over the full expected relationship with such subscribers (“Subscriber Value”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below) in comparison to the costs associated with adding these customers, regardless of whether or not the costs are expensed or capitalized in the period (“Creation Cost”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes that Subscriber Value, Creation Costs, and Total Value Generated are useful metrics for investors because they present an unlevered view of all of the costs associated with new customers in a period compared to the expected future cash flows from these customers over a 30-year period, based on contracted pricing terms with its customers, which is not observable in any current or historic GAAP-derived metric. Management believes it is useful for investors to also evaluate the future expected cash flows from all customers that have been deployed through the respective measurement date, less estimated costs to maintain such systems and estimated distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors (“Gross Earning Assets”, more fully defined in the definitions appendix below). The Company also believes Gross Earning Assets is useful for management and investors because it represents the remaining future expected cash flows from existing customers, which is not a current or historic GAAP-derived measure.\n\nVarious assumptions are made when calculating these metrics. Both Subscriber Value and Gross Earning Assets utilize a 6% rate to discount future cash flows to the present period. Furthermore, these metrics assume that customers renew after the initial contract period at a rate equal to 90% of the rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. For Customer Agreements with 25-year initial contract terms, a 5-year renewal period is assumed. For a 20-year initial contract term, a 10-year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system. Estimated cost of servicing assets has been deducted and is estimated based on the service agreements underlying each fund.\n\n**_In-period volume metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \nCustomer Additions | 31,910  \nSubscriber Additions (included within Customer Additions) | 30,348  \nSolar Energy Capacity Installed (in Megawatts) | 229.7  \nSolar Energy Capacity Installed for Subscribers (in Megawatts) | 220.7  \nStorage Capacity Installed (in Megawatt hours) | 336.3  \n**_In-period value creation metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \nSubscriber Value Contracted Period | $ | 47,557  \nSubscriber Value Renewal Period | $ | 3,666  \nSubscriber Value | $ | 51,223  \nCreation Cost | $ | 36,591  \nNet Subscriber Value | $ | 14,632  \nTotal Value Generated (in millions) | $ | 444.1  \n**_In-period environmental impact metrics:_** |  **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \nPositive Environmental Impact from Customers (over trailing twelve months, in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) | 4.1  \nPositive Expected Lifetime Environmental Impact from Customer Additions (in millions of metric tons of CO2 avoidance) | 4.7  \n**_Period-end metrics:_** | **September 30, 2024**  \nCustomers | 1,015,910  \nSubscribers (subset of Customers) | 858,477  \nHouseholds Served in Low-Income Multifamily Properties | 19,321  \nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity (in Megawatts) | 7,288  \nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers (in Megawatts) | 6,204  \nNetworked Storage Capacity (in Megawatt hours) | 2,133  \nAnnual Recurring Revenue (in millions) | $ | 1,517  \nAverage Contract Life Remaining (in years) | 17.6  \nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period (in millions) | $ | 12,964  \nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period (in millions) | $ | 3,815  \nGross Earning Assets (in millions) | $ | 16,780  \nNet Earning Assets (in millions) | $ | 6,231  \n  \n_Figures presented above may not sum due to rounding.

Creation Cost is comprised of (i) installation costs, which includes the increase in gross solar energy system assets and the cost of customer agreement revenue, excluding depreciation expense of fixed solar assets, and operating and maintenance expenses associated with existing Subscribers, plus (ii) sales and marketing costs, including increases to the gross capitalized costs to obtain contracts, net of the amortization expense of the costs to obtain contracts, plus (iii) general and administrative costs, and less (iv) the gross profit derived from selling systems to customers under sale agreements and Sunrun’s product distribution and lead generation businesses. Creation Cost excludes stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and research and development expenses, along with other items the company deems to be non-recurring or extraordinary in nature. The gross margin derived from solar energy systems and product sales is included as an offset to Creation Cost since these sales are ancillary to the overall business model and lowers our overall cost of business. The sales, marketing, general and administrative costs in Creation Costs is inclusive of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities related to the entire business, including solar energy system and product sales. As such, by including the gross margin on solar energy system and product sales as a contra cost, the value of all activities of the Company’s segment are represented in the Net Subscriber Value.\n\n**Subscriber Value** represents the per subscriber value of upfront and future cash flows (discounted at 6%) from Subscriber Additions in the period, including expected payments from customers as set forth in Customer Agreements, net proceeds from tax equity finance partners, payments from utility incentive and state rebate programs, contracted net grid service program cash flows, projected future cash flows from solar energy renewable energy credit sales, less estimated operating and maintenance costs to service the systems and replace equipment, consistent with estimates by independent engineers, over the initial term of the Customer Agreements and estimated renewal period. For Customer Agreements with 25 year initial contract terms, a 5 year renewal period is assumed. For a 20 year initial contract term, a 10 year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system.\n\n**Net Subscriber Value** represents Subscriber Value less Creation Cost.\n\n**Total Value Generated** represents Net Subscriber Value multiplied by Subscriber Additions.\n\n**Customers** represent the cumulative number of Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Subscribers** represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as Deployments through the measurement date.\n\n**Networked Solar Energy Capacity** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Networked Solar Energy Capacity for Subscribers** represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date, that have been subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n\n**Networked Storage Capacity** represents the aggregate megawatt hour capacity of our storage systems that have been recognized as Deployments, from the company’s inception through the measurement date.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets** is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period** represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 6%) that we would receive from Subscribers in future periods as set forth in Customer Agreements, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from tax equity partners, government incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utilities or grid operators.\n\n**Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period** is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer’s contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\n**Net Earning Assets** represents Gross Earning Assets, plus total cash, less adjusted debt and less pass-through financing obligations, as of the same measurement date. Debt is adjusted to exclude a pro-rata share of non-recourse debt associated with funds with project equity structures along with debt associated with the company’s ITC safe harboring facility. Because estimated cash distributions to our project equity partners are deducted from Gross Earning Assets, a proportional share of the corresponding project level non-recourse debt is deducted from Net Earning Assets, as such debt would be serviced from cash flows already excluded from Gross Earning Assets.\n\n**Cash Generation** is calculated using the change in our unrestricted cash balance from our consolidated balance sheet, less net proceeds (or plus net repayments) from all recourse debt (inclusive of convertible debt), and less any primary equity issuances or net proceeds derived from employee stock award activity (or plus any stock buybacks or dividends paid to common stockholders) as presented on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company expects to continue to raise tax equity and asset-level non-recourse debt to fund growth, and as such, these sources of cash are included in the definition of Cash Generation. Cash Generation also excludes long-term asset or business divestitures and equity investments in external non-consolidated businesses (or less dividends or distributions received in connection with such equity investments). Restricted cash in a reserve account with a balance equal to the amount outstanding of 2026 convertible notes is considered unrestricted cash for the purposes of calculating Cash Generation.\n\n**Annual Recurring Revenue** represents revenue arising from Customer Agreements over the following twelve months for Subscribers that have met initial revenue recognition criteria as of the measurement date.\n\n**Average Contract Life Remaining** represents the average number of years remaining in the initial term of Customer Agreements for Subscribers that have met revenue recognition criteria as of the measurement date.\n\n**Households Served in Low-Income Multifamily Properties** represent the number of individual rental units served in low-income multi-family properties from shared solar energy systems deployed by Sunrun. Households are counted when the solar energy system has interconnected with the grid, which may differ from Deployment recognition criteria.\n\n**Positive Environmental Impact from Customers** represents the estimated reduction in carbon emissions as a result of energy produced from our Networked Solar Energy Capacity over the trailing twelve months. The figure is presented in millions of metric tons of avoided carbon emissions and is calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AVERT tool. The figure is calculated using the most recent published tool from the EPA, using the current-year avoided emission factor for distributed resources on a state by state basis. The environmental impact is estimated based on the system, regardless of whether or not Sunrun continues to own the system or any associated renewable energy credits.\n\n**Positive Expected Lifetime Environmental Impact from Customer Additions** represents the estimated reduction in carbon emissions over thirty years as a result of energy produced from solar energy systems that were recognized as Deployments in the period. The figure is presented in millions of metric tons of avoided carbon emissions and is calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AVERT tool. The figure is calculated using the most recent published tool from the EPA, using the current-year avoided emission factor for distributed resources on a state by state basis, leveraging our estimated production figures for such systems, which degrade over time, and is extrapolated for 30 years. The environmental impact is estimated based on the system, regardless of whether or not Sunrun continues to own the system or any associated renewable energy credits.\n\n**Total Cash** represents the total of the restricted cash balance and unrestricted cash balance from our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n**Investor & Analyst Contact:**\n\nPatrick JobinSVP, Deputy CFO & Investor Relations Officerinvestors@sunrun.com\n\n**Media Contact:**\n\nWyatt SemanekDirector, Corporate Communicationspress@sunrun.com\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/5e4df695-28b9-4854-b8eb-5102dfc50d77/small/sunrun-logo-darkblue-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5e4df695-28b9-4854-b8eb-5102dfc50d77)\n\nSource: Sunrun Inc. \n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Tear Sheet ](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1f01f48315d5ffe8f04dd82a7a9b907b/sunrun/files/Tear_Sheet.pdf \"Tear Sheet\")\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://investors.sunrun.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n###  This website uses cookies \n\nWe and our third-party partners use cookies and other technologies to enhance and track your experience on this site, conduct analytics, and personalize marketing to you.

The value of the\nInvestment Tax Credits (ITC) are recognized as\nIncentive revenue, when monetized using a\npass-through financing structure.\nThe majority of Customer Agreements and\nIncentives COGS is depreciation (~$532m total\ndepreciation & amortization in 2023). This also\nincludes operating & maintenance costs and\nnon-capitalized costs associated with\ninstallation-related activities.\nA large portion of our Sales & Marketing spend is\nexpensed in period, while it relates to customers\nwith ~20 or ~25 years of contracted revenue.\nThe Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests is\nprimarily driven by our monetization of the\nInvestment Tax Credit (ITC) with our Tax Equity\npartners with partnership flip structures. Assume a\ntax investor contributes about ~$1.8 per watt in\ncash and then immediately receives back a tax\ncredit worth $1.3 per watt. After receipt of the tax\ncredit, the investor’s remaining non-controlling\ninterest in Sunrun’s solar facility is now only $0.5\nper watt, which is repaid over about 6 years\nthrough cash distributions and depreciation\ndeductions. Like the elimination of a liability, the\nreduction in the tax investor’s non-controlling\ninterest from ~$1.8 per watt to ~$0.5 per watt is\nincome to Sunrun common shareholders.

These costs exclude depreciation expense, costs associated\nwith servicing the existing fleet of customers, and stock-based compensation expense.\nEstimated fleet servicing costs over the full life of the customer agreement and estimated renewal period are\nalready deducted from Subscriber Value and thus not included in Creation Costs. Installation cost excludes\ncosts related to solar energy systems sold directly to customers for cash. The capitalized costs that are\nincluded and associated depreciation expense can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial\nstatements and the applicable customer volume and estimated fleet servicing costs can be found in the\ncalculation detail attached to this memo.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing cost per customer is calculated based on (i) sales and marketing expenses incurred in\nthe period and (ii) the increase in gross capitalized cost to obtain contracts.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our\nfuture financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,”\n“should,” “expects,” “plans,” “goals,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,”\n“continue,” “likely,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-\nlooking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n• the potential impact of regulatory and policy development and changes;\n• the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, and decreases to federal solar tax credits;\n• the potential impact of volatile or rising interest rates on our interest expense;\n• our industry’s, and specifically our, continued ability to manage costs (including, but not limited to, equipment costs) associated with solar service\nofferings;\n• potential changes in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other energy sources;\n• the sufficiency of our cash, investment fund commitments and available borrowings to meet our anticipated cash needs;\n• our need and ability to raise capital, refinance existing debt, and finance our operations and solar energy systems from new and existing investors;\n• our investment in research and development and new product offerings;\n• determinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of the creditable basis of our solar energy systems;\n• our ability to manage our supply chains and distribution channels and the impact of natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs and trade\nbarriers, export regulations, bank failures, geopolitical conflicts, macroeconomic conditions, and other events beyond our control on our business and\noperations, results of operations, and financial position;\n• our business plan and our ability to effectively manage our growth, including our rate of revenue growth;\n• our ability to further penetrate existing markets, expand into new markets and our expectations regarding market growth (including, but not limited to,\nexpected cancellation rates);\n• our expectations concerning relationships with third parties, including the attraction, retention and continued existence of qualified solar partners;\n• the impact of seasonality on our business;\n• our strategic partnerships and investments and the expected benefits of such partnerships and investments;\n• our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and risk that the integration of these\nacquisitions may disrupt our business and management;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property and customer data, as well as to maintain our brand;\n• the willingness and ability of our solar partners to fulfill their respective warranty and other contractual obligations;\n2\n• our ability to renew or replace expiring, canceled, or terminated Customer Agreements at favorable rates or on a long-term basis;\n• the ability of our solar energy systems to operate or deliver energy for any reason, including if interconnection or transmission facilities on which we rely\nbecome unavailable;\n• our expectations regarding certain performance objectives and the renewal rates and purchase value of our solar energy systems after expiration of our\nCustomer Agreements;\n• the calculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics and accounting policies; and\n• our ability to capitalize on the market opportunities created by the electrification of the U.S. economy with renewable energy.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in the section titled “Risk\nFactors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks\nemerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to\nwhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.\nThese risks and uncertainties may be amplified by evolving economic and regulatory conditions, including increasing or volatile interest rates. The extent to\nwhich these risks and uncertainties impact our business, operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on\nnumerous factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, rapidity, and intensity of these conditions, how widespread their impact is and will continue to be on\nour industry, and how quickly and to what extent more predictable and stable economic conditions resume. In light of these risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ\nmaterially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-\nlooking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in these\nforward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of\nthese forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law.\nYou should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels\nof activity, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.\n3\nSELECTED RISKS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS\nInvesting in our common stock involves numerous risks, including the risks described in Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q. Below are some of these risks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSelected Risks Related to the Solar Industry\n• The solar energy industry is an emerging market which is constantly evolving and may not develop to the size or at the rate we expect.\n• We have historically benefited from declining costs in our industry, and our business and financial results may be harmed as a result of recent, and any\ncontinued increases in, costs associated with our solar service offerings and any failure of these costs to continue declining as we currently expect. If\nwe do not reduce our cost structure in the future, our ability to continue to be profitable may be impaired.\n• We face competition from traditional energy companies as well as solar and other renewable energy companies.\nSelected Risks Related to Our Operating Structure and Financing Activities\n• We need to raise capital to finance the continued growth of our operations and solar service business. If capital is not available to us on acceptable\nterms, as and when needed, our business and prospects would be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, our business is affected by general\neconomic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Volatility in current economic conditions could adversely impact\nour business, including our ability to raise financing.\n• Volatility and increases in interest rates raise our cost of capital and may adversely impact our business.\n• We expect to incur substantially more debt in the future, which could intensify the risks to our business.\nSelected Risks Related to Regulation and Policy\n• The customer value proposition for distributed solar, storage, and home electrification products is influenced by a number of factors, including, but not\nlimited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of electricity not consumed on site and exported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of\ncustomers’ utility bills, various policies related to the permitting and interconnection costs of our products to homes and the grid, the availability of\nincentives for solar, batteries, and other electrification products, and other policies which allow aggregations of our systems to provide the grid value.\nSignificant changes to any of these factors may impact the competitiveness of our service offerings to customers.\n• Electric utility statutes and regulations and changes to such statutes or regulations may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the\npurchase and use of our solar service offerings that may significantly reduce demand for such offerings.\n• Regulations and policies related to rate design could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar service offerings, reduce the value of the\nelectricity our systems produce, and reduce any savings that our customers could realize from our solar service offerings.\nSelected Risks Related to Our Business Operations\n• Our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties, including our solar partners.\n• We and our solar partners depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, batteries, and other system components to adequately meet\nanticipated demand for our solar and storage service offerings. Any shortage, bottlenecks, delay, detentions, or component price change from these\nsuppliers, or the acquisition of any of these suppliers by a competitor, could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations and loss of market\nshare.\n• If we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer service,\nor adequately address competitive challenges.\n• We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions\nmay disrupt our business and our management team.\n• The failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees and service providers in key functions would constrain our growth and our ability to\ntimely complete customers’ Projects and successfully manage customer accounts.\n4\n• Regulators may impose rules on the type of electricians qualified to install and service our solar and battery systems in California, which may result in\nworkforce shortages, operational delays, and increased costs.\n• Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results\nof operations for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\n• Our actual financial results may differ materially from any guidance we may publish from time to time.\n• Failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, contracts, self-regulatory schemes, standards, and other obligations\nrelated to data privacy and security (including security incidents) could harm our business. Compliance or the actual or perceived failure to comply with\nsuch obligations could increase the costs of our products/services, limit their use or adoption, and otherwise negatively affect our operating results and\nbusiness.\nSelected Risks Related to Taxes and Accounting\n• Our ability to provide our solar and storage service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to finance\nthese systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\n• If the IRS makes determinations that the creditable basis of our solar energy systems is materially lower than what we have claimed, we may have to\npay significant amounts to our fund investors, and our business, financial condition, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n• Our business currently depends on the availability of utility rebates, tax credits and other benefits, tax exemptions and exclusions, and other financial\nincentives, on the federal, state, and/or local levels. We may be adversely affected by changes in, and application of, these laws or other incentives to\nus, and the expiration, elimination. or reduction of these benefits could adversely impact our business.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business may be harmed.\n5\nSunrun Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Thousands, Except Share Par Values)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 533,863 $ 678,821\nRestricted cash 476,606 308,869\nAccounts receivable (net of allowances for credit losses of $17,024 and $19,042 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) 182,513 172,001\nInventories 342,348 459,746\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 67,132 262,822\nTotal current assets 1,602,462 1,882,259\nRestricted cash 148 148\nSolar energy systems, net 14,427,903 13,028,871\nProperty and equipment, net 134,613 149,139\nGoodwill 3,122,168 3,122,168\nOther assets 2,817,029 2,267,652\nTotal assets (1) $ 22,104,323 $ 20,450,237\nLiabilities and total equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 244,184 $ 230,723\nDistributions payable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 43,871 35,180\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 410,488 499,225\nDeferred revenue, current portion 120,991 128,600\nDeferred grants, current portion 8,165 8,199\nFinance lease obligations, current portion 26,532 22,053\nNon-recourse debt, current portion 236,227 547,870\nPass-through financing obligation, current portion 1,050 16,309\nTotal current liabilities 1,091,508 1,488,159\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion 1,171,925 1,067,461\nDeferred grants, net of current portion 188,589 195,724\nFinance lease obligations, net of current portion 74,627 68,753\nConvertible senior notes 603,510 392,867\nLine of credit 392,524 539,502\nNon-recourse debt, net of current portion 11,219,898 9,191,689\nPass-through financing obligation, net of current portion — 278,333\nOther liabilities 212,091 190,866\nDeferred tax liabilities 115,258 122,870\nTotal liabilities (1) 15,069,930 13,536,224\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 15)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests 633,817 676,177\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value—authorized, 200,000 shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; no shares issued and outstanding as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 — —\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value—authorized, 2,000,000 shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; issued and outstanding, 224,087\nand 219,392 shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 22 22\nAdditional paid-in capital 6,707,031 6,609,229\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 37,189 54,676\nRetained earnings (1,466,209) (1,433,699)\nTotal stockholders’ equity 5,278,033 5,230,228\nNoncontrolling interests 1,122,543 1,007,608\nTotal equity 6,400,576 6,237,836\nTotal liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and total equity $ 22,104,323 $ 20,450,237\n6\n1) The Company’s consolidated assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include $12,715,551 and $11,538,540, respectively, in assets of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) that can\nonly be used to settle obligations of the VIEs.

Organization\nSunrun Inc. (“Sunrun” or the “Company”) was formed in 2007. The Company is engaged in the design, development, installation, sale, ownership and\nmaintenance of residential solar energy and battery storage systems (“Projects”) in the United States.\nSunrun acquires customers directly and through relationships with various solar and strategic partners (“Partners”). The Projects are constructed either\nby Sunrun or by Sunrun’s Partners and are mostly owned by the Company. Sunrun’s customers enter into an agreement to utilize the solar energy system (the\n“Customer Agreement”) which typically has an initial term of 20 or 25 years. Sunrun monitors, maintains, and insures the Projects during the term of the\nCustomer Agreement. The Company also sells battery storage along with the solar energy systems and products, such as panels and racking and solar leads\ngenerated by customers.\nThe Company has formed various subsidiaries (“Funds”) to finance the development of Projects. These Funds, structured as limited liability companies,\nobtain financing from outside investors and purchase or lease Projects from Sunrun under master purchase or master lease agreements. The Company\ncurrently utilizes two legal structures in its investment Funds, which are referred to as: (i) pass-through financing obligations, and (ii) partnership-flips.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting, and in the opinion of\nmanagement, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the Company's interim financial statements. Certain\ninformation and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to\nsuch rules and regulations. As such, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or other future\nperiods.\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts and operations of the Company and those of its subsidiaries, including Funds, in which the\nCompany has a controlling financial interest. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an\nentity. However, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve holding a majority of the voting\ninterests. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 (“ASC 810”)\nConsolidation, the Company consolidates any VIE of which it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary, as defined in ASC 810, is the party that has (1)\nthe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or\nthe right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company evaluates its relationships with its VIEs on an ongoing\nbasis to determine whether it continues to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of VIEs that are\nconsolidated. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nWhen necessary, reclassifications have been made to the Company’s prior period financial information to conform with current year presentation and are\nnot material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n13\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly makes estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to,\nrevenue recognition constraints that result in variable consideration, the discount rate used to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a\nsignificant financing component, the estimates that affect the collectability of accounts receivable, the valuation of inventories, the useful lives of solar energy\nsystems, the useful lives of property and equipment, the effective interest rate used to amortize pass-through financing obligations, the discount rate used for\noperating and financing leases, the valuation of stock-based compensation, the determination of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets, the\nfair value of debt instruments disclosed and the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests. The Company bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has one operating segment with one business activity, providing solar energy services and products to customers. The Company’s chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer, who manages operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources. When\nevaluating performance and allocating resources, the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis.\nRevenue from external customers (including, but not limited to homeowners) for each group of similar products and services is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCustomer agreements $ 368,641 $ 289,678 $ 1,030,859 $ 789,256\nIncentives 37,220 26,850 85,794 75,895\nCustomer agreements and incentives 405,861 316,528 1,116,653 865,151\nSolar energy systems 47,189 135,476 167,535 566,861\nProduct sales 84,123 111,177 235,039 311,211\nSolar energy systems and product sales 131,312 246,653 402,574 878,072\nTotal revenue $ 537,173 $ 563,181 $ 1,519,227 $ 1,743,223\nRevenue from Customer Agreements includes payments by customers for the use of the system as well as utility and other rebates assigned by the\ncustomer to the Company in the Customer Agreement. Revenue from incentives includes revenue from the sale of commercial investment tax credits\n(“Commercial ITCs”) and solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”).\nCash and Restricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents amounts related to obligations under certain financing transactions and future replacement of solar energy system\ncomponents.\n14\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same\nsuch amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash and restricted cash consists of the following (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBeginning of period:\nCash $ 678,821 $ 740,508\nRestricted cash, current and long-term 309,017 212,515\nTotal $ 987,838 $ 953,023\nEnd of period:\nCash $ 533,863 $ 643,787\nRestricted cash, current and long-term 476,754 308,158\nTotal $ 1,010,617 $ 951,945\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers, as well as state and utility rebates due from government agencies and utility companies.\nUnder Customer Agreements, the customers typically assign incentive rebates to the Company.\nAccounts receivable, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCustomer receivables $ 190,548 $ 186,537\nOther receivables 8,989 4,506\nAllowance for credit losses (17,024) (19,042)\nTotal $ 182,513 $ 172,001\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment\nat least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Company has determined that it\noperates as one reporting unit and the Company’s goodwill is recorded at the enterprise level. The Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill on\nOctober 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired. When assessing\ngoodwill for impairment, the Company uses qualitative and if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Goodwill. The\nCompany also considers its enterprise value and if necessary, discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and estimates, including the\nCompany’s future financial performance, weighted average cost of capital and interpretation of currently enacted tax laws.\nCircumstances that could indicate impairment and require the Company to perform a quantitative impairment test include significant declines in the\nCompany’s financial results or enterprise value relative to its net book value or a sustained decline in the Company’s stock price below its book value, coupled\nwith declines in valuations for comparable public companies or acquisition premiums. The Company tests goodwill for impairment for its one reporting unit using\nan estimated fair value approach. Due to the sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization after consideration of a control premium below the book\nvalue of equity, the Company recorded an impairment charge as of September 30, 2023 related to the recoverability of its goodwill for its one reporting unit.\nAfter the impairment charge, the fair value of the Company’s one reporting unit approximated its estimated carrying value. No additional impairment had\noccurred as of December 31, 2023.\n15\nShould, among other events and circumstances, industry conditions deteriorate, the outlook for future operating results and cash flow decline or\nregulations change, costs of equity or debt capital increase, valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations decrease, or the\nCompany’s market capitalization experience a further sustained decline below its book value, the Company may need to further reassess the recoverability of\ngoodwill in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, there were no indicators of goodwill impairment that would require an interim goodwill impairment test.\nDeferred Revenue\nWhen the Company receives consideration, or when such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to delivering goods or services to\nthe customer under the terms of a Customer Agreement, the Company records deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue consists of amounts for which the\ncriteria for revenue recognition have not yet been met and includes amounts that are collected or assigned from customers, including upfront deposits and\nprepayments, and rebates. Deferred revenue relating to financing components represents the cumulative excess of interest expense recorded on financing\ncomponent elements over the related revenue recognized to date and will eventually net to zero by the end of the initial term. Amounts received related to the\nsales of SRECs which have not yet been delivered to the counterparty are recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe opening balance of deferred revenue was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022. Deferred revenue consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnder Customer Agreements:\nPayments received, net $ 927,422 $ 873,137\nFinancing component balance 77,829 72,289\n1,005,251 945,426\nUnder SREC contracts:\nPayments received, net 272,417 237,800\nFinancing component balance 15,248 12,835\n287,665 250,635\nTotal $ 1,292,916 $ 1,196,061\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $41.5 million and $31.0 million, respectively, and\nin the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $103.7 million and $84.7 million, respectively, from amounts\nincluded in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective periods. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted\nrevenue that has not yet been recognized and includes deferred revenue as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods.\nContracted but not yet recognized revenue was approximately $29.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which the Company expects to recognize\napproximately 5% over the next 12 months. The annual recognition is not expected to vary significantly over the next 10 years as the vast majority of existing\nCustomer Agreements have at least 10 years remaining, given that the average age of the Company’s fleet of residential solar energy systems under Customer\nAgreements is less than five years as a result of the Company experiencing significant growth in the last few years. The annual recognition on these existing\ncontracts will gradually decline over the midpoint of the Customer Agreements, which is around 10 years, as the typical 20- or 25-year initial term expires on\nindividual Customer Agreements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company\nuses valuation approaches to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The FASB\nestablishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:\n• Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n16\n• Level 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n• Level 3—Inputs that are unobservable, significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities and are supported by little or no market\ndata.\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, distributions payable to noncontrolling interests,\nderivatives, and recourse and non-recourse debt.\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not also measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are\nsubject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include goodwill that is written down to fair value when it is impaired, which\nuses Level 3 inputs. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it\nexpects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nCustomer agreements and incentives\nCustomer agreements and incentives revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from Customer Agreements in which the Company provides\ncontinuous access to a functioning solar energy system and revenue from the sales of SRECs generated by the Company’s solar energy systems to third\nparties.\nThe Company begins to recognize revenue on Customer Agreements when permission to operate (“PTO”) is given by the local utility company or on\nthe date daily operation commences if utility approval is not required. Revenue recognition does not necessarily follow the receipt of cash. For Customer\nAgreements that include a fixed fee per month which entitles the customer to any and all electricity generated by the system, and for which the Company’s\nobligation is to provide continuous access to a functioning solar energy system, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the time that it satisfies its\nperformance obligations, which is over the initial term of the Customer Agreements. For Customer Agreements that charge a fixed price per kilowatt hour, and\nfor which the Company’s obligation is the provision of electricity from a solar energy system, revenue is recognized based on the actual amount of power\ngenerated at rates specified under the contracts. Customer Agreements typically have an initial term of 20 or 25 years. After the initial contract term, Customer\nAgreements typically automatically renew annually or for a five year term.\nSREC revenue arises from the sale of environmental credits generated by solar energy systems and is generally recognized upon delivery of the\nSRECs to the counterparty or upon reporting of the electricity generation.\nIn determining the transaction price, the Company adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money when the\ntiming of payments provides it with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract\ncontains a significant financing component. When adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component, the Company uses the\ndiscount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the entity and its customer at contract inception and recognizes the revenue\namount on a straight-line basis over the term of the Customer Agreement, and interest expense using the effective interest rate method.\nConsideration from customers is considered variable due to the performance guarantee under Customer Agreements and liquidating damage\nprovisions under SREC contracts in the event minimum deliveries are not achieved. Performance guarantees provide a credit to the customer if the system’s\ncumulative production, as measured on various PTO anniversary dates, is below the Company’s guarantee of a specified minimum. Revenue is recognized to\nthe extent it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur.\n17\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the Customer Agreements, and are included in Sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nSolar energy systems and product sales\nFor solar energy systems sold to customers, revenue is recognized when the solar energy system passes inspection by the authority having\njurisdiction, which inspection generally occurs after installation but prior to PTO, at which time the Company has met the performance obligation in the contract.\nFor solar energy system sales that include delivery obligations up until interconnection to the local power grid with PTO, the Company recognizes revenue at\nPTO. Certain solar energy systems sold to customers include fees for extended warranty and maintenance services. These fees are recognized over the life of\nthe service agreement. The Company’s installation Projects are typically completed in less than twelve months.\nProduct sales consist of solar panels, racking systems, inverters, other solar energy products sold to resellers, roofing repair, and customer leads.\nProduct sales revenue is recognized at the time when control is transferred, upon shipment, or as services are delivered. Customer lead revenue, included in\nproduct sales, is recognized at the time the lead is delivered.\nTaxes assessed by government authorities that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions are excluded from solar energy systems and\nproduct sales.\nCost of Revenue\nCustomer agreements and incentives\nCost of revenue for customer agreements and incentives is primarily comprised of (1) the depreciation of the cost of the solar energy systems, as\nreduced by amortization of deferred grants, (2) solar energy system operations, monitoring and maintenance costs including associated personnel costs, and\n(3) allocated corporate overhead costs.\nSolar energy systems and product sales\nCost of revenue for solar energy systems and non-lead generation product sales consist of direct and indirect material and labor costs for solar energy\nsystems installations and product sales. Also included are engineering and design costs, estimated warranty costs, freight costs, allocated corporate overhead\ncosts, vehicle depreciation costs and personnel costs associated with supply chain, logistics, operations management, safety and quality control. Cost of\nrevenue for lead generations consists of costs related to direct-response advertising activities associated with generating customer leads.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nAccounting standards to be adopted:\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements — Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update\nand Simplification Initiative, to modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of topics, which will allow users to more easily compare entities\nsubject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the SEC’s requirements, and to align the requirements in the\nFASB accounting standard codification with the SEC’s regulations. The amendments in this ASU are effective when the related disclosure is effectively removed\nfrom Regulations S-X or S-K, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its future\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands\ndisclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and requires enhanced information about a reportable segment’s expenses, interim segment profit or\nloss, and how a public entity’s CODM uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and\n18\nallocating resources. This ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and\nthe impact it may have on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures in\nan entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This ASU is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it may have on its\nfinancial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued Final Rule 33-11275 and 34-99678 - The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for\nInvestors. This rule requires registrants to provide standardized disclosures related to climate-related risks, governance and risk management strategies, and\nthe financial impact of severe weather events and Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. The rule requires implementation in phases between 2025 and\n2033. In April 2024, the SEC announced that it would voluntarily stay its final climate disclosure rules pending judicial review. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of the rule on its future consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3. Fair Value Measurement\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and distributions payable to\nnoncontrolling interests approximates fair value due to their short-term nature and falls under the Level 2 hierarchy. The carrying values and fair values of debt\ninstruments are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nRecourse debt $ 996,034 $ 1,152,113 $ 932,369 $ 844,727\nSenior debt 4,135,861 4,125,315 4,114,134 4,082,994\nSubordinated debt 2,638,532 2,573,620 2,219,573 2,131,994\nSecuritization debt 4,681,732 4,562,296 3,405,852 3,191,542\nTotal $ 12,452,159 $ 12,413,344 $ 10,671,928 $ 10,251,257\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of certain recourse debt and certain senior, subordinated and securitization loans\napproximate their carrying values because their interest rates are variable rates that approximate rates currently available to the Company. At September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s other debt instruments are based on rates currently offered for debt with similar maturities and\nterms. The Company’s fair value of the debt instruments fell under the Level 2 hierarchy. These valuation approaches involve some level of management\nestimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market.\n19\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the fair value hierarchy,\nare as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 78,060 $ — $ 78,060\nTotal $ — $ 78,060 $ — $ 78,060\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 87,101 $ — $ 87,101\nTotal $ — $ 87,101 $ — $ 87,101\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 132,734 $ — $ 132,734\nTotal $ — $ 132,734 $ — $ 132,734\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 60,401 $ — $ 60,401\nTotal $ — $ 60,401 $ — $ 60,401\nThe above balances are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets, except for $23.1 million and\n$55.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its interest rate swaps using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an assessment of the risk of\nnon-performance by the interest rate swap counterparty and an evaluation of the Company’s credit risk in valuing derivative instruments. The valuation model\nuses various inputs including contractual terms, interest rate curves, credit spreads, and measures of volatility.\nNote 4. Inventories\nInventories consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw materials $ 304,647 $ 413,410\nWork-in-process 37,701 46,336\nTotal $ 342,348 $ 459,746\nNote 5. Solar Energy Systems, net\nSolar energy systems, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSolar energy system equipment costs $ 13,816,521 $ 12,558,996\nInverters and batteries 2,366,478 1,845,580\nTotal solar energy systems 16,182,999 14,404,576\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,582,654) (2,165,171)\nAdd: construction-in-progress 827,558 789,466\nTotal solar energy systems, net $ 14,427,903 $ 13,028,871\nAll solar energy systems, including construction-in-progress, have been leased to or are subject to signed Customer Agreements with customers. In\naccordance with its policy, the Company periodically reviews the\n20\nestimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis and recognizes any changes in estimated useful lives by prospectively adjusting depreciation\nexpense. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed an assessment of its battery equipment, which included review of an\nindependent engineering report, and determined that the useful life of its batteries was longer than the estimated useful life being used to calculate\ndepreciation. As a result, effective April 1, 2024, the Company changed its estimated useful life to reflect the estimated period these assets will remain in\nservice. The estimated useful life of batteries previously was 10 years and was increased to 15 years. The impact of this change in estimate reduces\ndepreciation expense and was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For batteries placed in service as of the effective date of\nApril 1, 2024, the Company estimates the impact on depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2024 will be $14.0 million. The Company recorded\ndepreciation expense related to solar energy systems of $146.2 million and $128.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $431.3 million and $365.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The depreciation expense was\nreduced by the amortization of deferred grants of $2.0 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $6.1 million and $6.2 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 6. Other Assets\nOther assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCosts to obtain contracts - Customer Agreements $ 1,946,323 $ 1,565,098\nCosts to obtain contracts - incentives 2,481 2,481\nAccumulated amortization of costs to obtain contracts (223,129) (168,564)\nUnbilled receivables 622,583 468,379\nAllowance for credit loss on unbilled receivables (6,325) (4,774)\nEquity investment 132,579 132,563\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 82,717 91,635\nOther assets 259,800 180,834\nTotal $ 2,817,029 $ 2,267,652\nThe Company recorded amortization of costs to obtain contracts of $20.9 million and $13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $55.2 million and $39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in Sales and marketing in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe majority of unbilled receivables arise from fixed price escalators included in the Company’s long-term Customer Agreements. The escalator is\nincluded in calculating the total estimated transaction value for an individual Customer Agreement. The total estimated transaction value is then recognized over\nthe term of the Customer Agreement. The amount of unbilled receivables increases while billings for an individual Customer Agreement are less than the\nrevenue recognized for that Customer Agreement. Conversely, the amount of unbilled receivables decreases once the billings become higher than the amount\nof revenue recognized in the period. At the end of the initial term of a Customer Agreement, the cumulative amounts recognized as revenue and billed to date\nare the same, therefore the unbilled receivable balance for an individual Customer Agreement will be zero. The Company applies an estimated loss-rate in\norder to determine the current expected credit loss for unbilled receivables. The estimated loss-rate is determined by analyzing historical credit losses,\nresidential first and second mortgage foreclosures and consumers’ utility default rates, as well as current economic conditions.

Borrowings under the Facility may be designated as Base\nRate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, subject to certain terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement. Base Rate Loans accrue interest at a rate per year equal to 2.25% to\n2.75% depending on total outstanding balance as a percentage of total commitment plus the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the interest rate determined\nfrom time to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate and notified to the Company, (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (defined below) for a one-month interest period\nin effect on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% and (d) 0.00%. Term SOFR Loans accrue interest at a rate\nper annum equal to (a) 3.25% to 3.75% depending on total outstanding balance as a percentage of total commitment plus (b) the greater of (i) 0.00% and (ii) the sum of (x)\nthe forward-looking term rate for a period comparable to the applicable available tenor based on SOFR that is published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Ltd or a\nsuccessor for the applicable interest period and (y) (1) if the applicable interest period is one month, 0.11448%, (2) if the applicable interest period is three months,\n0.26161% or (c) if the applicable interest period is six months, 0.42826% (the rate pursuant to clause (b), the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”). The maturity date of this facility\nhas been automatically extended to March 1, 2027, as of September 30, 2024, due to the Company maintaining funds on deposit in the Convertible Debt Reserve Account\nequal to the amount sufficient to repay at the scheduled maturity all of its 0% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 that are outstanding on September 30, 2024 and the\nCompany is otherwise in compliance with its quarter-end liquidity covenant. This facility is subject to various restrictive covenants, such as the completion and presentation\nof audited consolidated financial statements, maintaining a minimum modified interest coverage ratio, a minimum modified current ratio, a maximum modified leverage ratio,\nand a minimum unencumbered cash balance, in each case, tested quarterly. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\n(5) Convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) under this category with an outstanding balance of $133.2 million as of September 30, 2024 will not bear regular\ninterest, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances relating to the Company’s\nfailure to comply with its reporting obligations under the Indenture or if the 2026 Notes are not freely tradeable as required by the indenture. The 2026 Notes will mature on\nFebruary 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased by the Company, redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms. The initial conversion rate of the Notes is\n8.4807 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of\napproximately $117.91 per share. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for any accrued\nand unpaid special interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change or an issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain\ncircumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its 2026 Notes in connection with such make-whole\nfundamental change or notice of redemption. The debt discount recorded on the 2026 Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 0.57%. As\nof September 30, 2024, $7.6 million of the debt discount was amortized to interest expense inception to date. In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company\nentered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2026 Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates at a cost of\napproximately $28.0 million. The 2026 Capped Calls are classified as equity and were recorded to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2021.\nThe 2026 Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $117.91 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price\nof the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $157.22 per share. The 2026 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately\n3.4 million shares of common stock. The 2026 Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of 2026 Notes\nand/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, as the case may be, in the event the market price\nper share of common stock, as measured under the 2026 Capped Calls, is greater than the strike price of the 2026 Capped Call, with such offset subject to a cap. If,\nhowever, the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the 2026 Capped Calls, exceeds the cap price of the 2026 Capped Calls, there would be\ndilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the common stock exceeds\nthe cap price. The final components of the 2026 Capped Calls are scheduled to expire on January 29, 2026. None of the conversion criteria has been met as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n23\n(6) Convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”) under this category with an outstanding balance of $483.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 will bear regular interest at 4.00% per annum, and the principal amount of the 2030 Notes will not accrete. The 2030 Notes may bear special interest\nunder specified circumstances relating to the Company’s failure to comply with its reporting obligations under the indenture or if the 2030 Notes are not freely tradeable as\nrequired by the indenture. The 2030 Notes will mature on March 1, 2030, unless repurchased by the Company, redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their\nterms prior to maturity. The initial conversion rate of the 2030 Notes is 61.3704 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, per $1,000 principal\namount of 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $16.29 per share. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental\nchange or an issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that\nelects to convert its 2030 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or notice of redemption. The debt discount recorded on the 2030 Notes is being\namortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.51%. As of September 30, 2024, $1.1 million of the debt discount was amortized to interest expense inception\nto date. In connection with the offering of the 2030 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2030 Capped Calls”) with certain of\nthe initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates at a cost of approximately $38.4 million. The 2030 Capped Calls are classified as equity and were recorded to\nadditional paid-in-capital within stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024. The 2030 Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $16.29 per share,\nsubject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2030 Notes. The 2030 Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $22.37 per share. The\n2030 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock. The 2030 Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce\nthe potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of 2030 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal\namount of the 2030 Notes, as the case may be, in the event the market price per share of Common Stock, as measured under the 2030 Capped Calls, is greater than the\nstrike price of the 2030 Capped Call, with such offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the 2030 Capped\nCalls, exceeds the cap price of the 2030 Capped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the\nextent that the then-market price per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. The final components of the 2030 Capped Calls are scheduled to expire on February\n27, 2030. None of the conversion criteria has been met as of September 30, 2024.\n(7) Certain loans under this category are part of project equity transactions.\n(8) Pursuant to the terms of the aggregation facilities within this category the Company may draw up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.8 billion in revolver borrowings\ndepending on the available borrowing base at the time.\n(9) Loans under this category with a fixed rate had a total outstanding balance of $895.5 million as of September 30, 2024.\n(10)A loan under this category with an outstanding balance of $149.3 million as of September 30, 2024 contains a put option that can be exercised beginning in 2036 that would\nrequire the Company to pay off the entire loan on November 30, 2037.\n(11)Loans under this category with a floating rate have a total outstanding balance of $637.7 million as of September 30, 2024.\n24\nSenior and Subordinated Debt Facilities\nEach of the Company’s senior and subordinated debt facilities contain customary covenants, including the requirement to maintain certain financial\nmeasurements and provide lender reporting. Each of the senior and subordinated debt facilities also contain certain provisions in the event of default that entitle\nlenders to take certain actions including acceleration of amounts due under the facilities and acquisition of membership interests and assets that are pledged to\nthe lenders under the terms of the senior and subordinated debt facilities. The facilities are non-recourse to the Company and are secured by net cash flows\nfrom Customer Agreements or inventories less certain operating, maintenance and other expenses that are available to the borrower after distributions to tax\nequity investors, where applicable. Under the terms of these facilities, the Company’s subsidiaries pay interest and principal from the net cash flows available to\nthe subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nNon-Recourse Financings\nIn connection with each of the Company’s non-recourse debt (including securitized loans), assets (consisting of membership interests in project\ncompanies that own photovoltaic systems and related Customer Agreements) were contributed by the Company to special purpose subsidiaries of the\nCompany (each a “Non-Recourse Borrower”). Each of such financings contains customary covenants including the requirement to provide reporting to the\nindenture trustee or collateral agent and, if applicable, ratings agencies. Each of the financings also contains certain provisions which entitle the indenture\ntrustee or collateral agent to take certain actions upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of amounts due under the facilities and the\nforeclosure on the assets of the Non-Recourse Borrower that are pledged to the lenders under the terms thereof. The facilities are non-recourse to the\nCompany and are secured by first priority security interests by each Non-Recourse Borrower in favor of the indenture trustee or collateral agent in all of the\nNon-Recourse Borrower’s assets including the cash flows from Customer Agreements which are available to each Non-Recourse Borrower after giving effect to\ncertain operating, maintenance and other expenses and, where applicable, distributions to tax equity investors. As a result of such security interests, the assets\nof each Non-Recourse Borrower are not available to the creditors of the Company unless and until distributions from such entities are made to the Company as\npermitted under the applicable facility documentation. Under the terms of these financings, each Non-Recourse Borrower pays interest and principal from such\nnet cash flows. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 9. Derivatives\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest payments due on certain of its term loans and aggregation facility. These swaps allow\nthe Company to incur fixed interest rates on these loans and receive payments based on variable interest rates with the swap counterparty based on SOFR\n(daily, one month, three month) on the notional amounts over the life of the swaps. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into bilateral\nagreements with its swap counterparties to transition the remaining portion of its swaps to SOFR. The Company made various elections under FASB ASC Topic\n848, Reference Rate Reform, related to changes in critical terms of the hedging relationships due to reference rate reform to not result in a de-designation of\nthese hedging relationships. As of September 2023, all of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements were indexed to SOFR. In December 2023, the\nCompany started using interest rate swaptions to protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates prior to expected future draws on the Company’s floating-\nrate facilities, at which point the Company enters into long-term interest rate hedges.\n25\nThe interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. The credit risk adjustment associated with these swaps is the risk of non-\nperformance by the counterparties to the contracts. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the hedge relationships on the Company’s interest rate\nswaps have been assessed as highly effective as the quarterly assessment performed determined changes in cash flows of the derivative instruments have\nbeen highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged items, are expected to be highly effective in the future and the critical terms of the\ninterest rate swaps match the critical terms of the underlying forecasted hedged transactions. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are subsequently\nreclassified into earnings, and are included in interest expense, net in the Company’s statements of operations, in the period that the hedged forecasted\ntransactions affect earnings. To the extent that the hedge relationships are not effective, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other\nexpenses, net in the Company’s statements of operations on a prospective basis.\nThe Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. When those conditions are met, the\nCompany presents derivatives at net fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the information related to these offsetting arrangements were as follows (in\nthousands):\nNet Amounts of Assets /\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in Liabilities Included in the\nRecognized Assets / the Consolidated Consolidated Balance\nInstrument Description Liabilities Balance Sheet Sheet Notional Amount (1)\nAssets:\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments $ 69,160 $ — $ 69,160 $ 907,105\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments(2) 8,900 (313) 8,587 696,435\nTotal derivative assets $ 78,060 $ (313) $ 77,747 $ 1,603,540\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments $ (8,434) $ — $ (8,434) $ 492,216\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments (78,667) 313 (78,354) 1,736,820\nTotal derivative liabilities $ (87,101) $ 313 $ (86,788) $ 2,229,036\nTotal $ (9,041) $ — $ (9,041) $ 3,832,576\n(1) Comprised of 55 interest rate swaps which effectively fix the SOFR portion of interest rates on outstanding balances of certain loans under the senior and\nsecuritized sections of the debt footnote table (see Note 8, Indebtedness) at 0.31% to 4.53% per annum. These swaps mature from August 13, 2027 to\nJanuary 31, 2043.\n(2) Includes 13 interest rate swaptions which effectively fix the SOFR portion of interest rates on future outstanding balances of certain loans under the senior\nrevolving section of the debt footnote table (see Note 8, Indebtedness) at 3.42% to 4.19% per annum. These swaptions expire from October 2, 2024 to\nDecember 4, 2024 with potential underlying swaps maturing on February 2, 2043.\n26\nAs of December 31, 2023, the information related to these offsetting arrangements were as follows (in thousands):\nNet Amounts of Assets /\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in Liabilities Included in the\nRecognized Assets / the Consolidated Consolidated Balance\nInstrument Description Liabilities Balance Sheet Sheet Notional Amount\nAssets:\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments $ 97,321 $ (5) $ 97,316 $ 1,416,686\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments 35,413 (5,246) 30,167 1,695,495\nTotal derivative assets $ 132,734 $ (5,251) $ 127,483 $ 3,112,181\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments (5,963) 5 (5,958) 324,042\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments (54,438) 5,246 (49,192) 809,785\nTotal derivative liabilities $ (60,401) $ 5,251 $ (55,150) $ 1,133,827\nTotal $ 72,333 $ — $ 72,333 $ 4,246,008\nThe losses (gains) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recognized into other comprehensive income (loss), before tax effect, consisted of the\nfollowing (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps $ 48,297 $ (79,261)\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps $ (11,160) $ (92,306)\n27\nThe (losses) gains on derivatives financial instruments recognized into the consolidated statements of operations, before tax effect, consisted of the\nfollowing (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nInterest expense, net Other expense, net Interest expense, net Other income, net\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps:\nGains reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (“AOCI”) into income $ (9,098) $ — $ (10,274) $ —\nDerivatives not designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps:\nGains (losses) recognized into income — 86,596 — (81,461)\nTotal (losses) gains $ (9,098) $ 86,596 $ (10,274) $ (81,461)\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nInterest expense, net Other income, net Interest expense, net Other expense, net\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps:\nGains reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (“AOCI”) into income $ (28,647) $ — $ (26,345) $ —\nDerivatives not designated as cash flow hedges:\nInterest rate swaps:\nGains (losses) recognized into income — 9,790 — (99,133)\nTotal (losses) gains $ (28,647) $ 9,790 $ (26,345) $ (99,133)\nAll amounts in AOCI in the consolidated statements of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity relate to derivatives, refer to the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss).

There were 37 undesignated derivative instruments recorded by the Company as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 10. Pass-Through Financing Obligations\nThe Company’s pass-through financing obligations (“Financing Obligations”) arise when the Company leases solar energy systems to Fund investors\nwho are considered commercial customers under a master lease agreement, and these investors in turn are assigned the Customer Agreements with\ncustomers. The Company receives all of the value attributable to the accelerated tax depreciation and some or all of the value attributable to the other\nincentives. Given the assignment of operating cash flows, this arrangement is accounted for as Financing Obligations. The Company also sells the rights and\nrelated value attributable to the Commercial ITC to these investors.\nUnder the Financing Obligation arrangement, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company finances the cost of solar energy systems with investors for an\ninitial term of seven years. The solar energy systems are subject to Customer Agreements with an initial term of typically 20 years that automatically renews\nannually, or for a term of five years. These solar energy systems are reported under the line item solar energy systems, net in the\n28\nconsolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cost of the solar energy systems placed in service under the Financing\nObligation arrangements was $58.4 million and $692.3 million, respectively. The accumulated depreciation related to these assets as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 was $11.3 million and $191.5 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company retired four of its\nfinancing obligations and terminated the associated leases for $253.9 million, which resulted in a gain on debt extinguishment of $49.5 million.\nThe investors make a series of large up-front payments and subsequent smaller quarterly payments (lease payments) to the subsidiary of the Company.\nThe Company accounts for the payments received from the investors under the Financing Obligation arrangement as borrowings by recording the proceeds\nreceived as Financing Obligations on its consolidated balance sheets, and cash provided by financing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThis Financing Obligation is reduced over a period of approximately seven years, by customer payments under the Customer Agreements. In addition, funds\npaid for the Commercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and recognized as revenue as the associated solar energy system reaches\nPTO. The Commercial ITC value, if any, is reflected in cash provided by operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for\nthe Customer Agreements consistent with the Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\nInterest is calculated on the Financing Obligations using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate, which is adjusted on a prospective\nbasis, is the interest rate that equates the present value of the estimated cash amounts to be received by the investor over the lease term with the present\nvalue of the cash amounts paid by the investor to the Company, adjusted for amounts received by the investor. The Financing Obligation is nonrecourse once\nthe associated assets have been placed in service and all the contractual arrangements have been assigned to the investor.\nUnder the Financing Obligation, the investor has a right to extend its right to receive cash flows from the customers beyond the initial term in certain\ncircumstances.\nUnder the Financing Obligation, the Company is responsible for services such as warranty support, accounting, lease servicing and performance\nreporting to customers. As part of the warranty and performance guarantee with the customers in applicable Funds, the Company guarantees certain specified\nminimum annual solar energy production output for the solar energy systems leased to the customers, which the Company accounts for as disclosed in Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n29\nNote 11. VIE Arrangements\nThe Company consolidated various VIEs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying amounts and classification of the VIEs’ assets\nand liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 375,111 $ 254,522\nRestricted cash 52,033 48,169\nAccounts receivable, net 96,476 76,249\nInventories 94,883 150,065\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 8,199 161,414\nTotal current assets 626,702 690,419\nSolar energy systems, net 11,568,737 10,469,093\nOther assets 520,112 379,028\nTotal assets $ 12,715,551 $ 11,538,540\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 5,816 $ 12,187\nDistributions payable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 43,872 35,181\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 38,168 185,766\nDeferred revenue, current portion 58,561 54,103\nNon-recourse debt, current portion 68,844 270,460\nTotal current liabilities 215,261 557,697\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion 720,811 654,310\nNon-recourse debt, net of current portion 1,361,476 1,189,161\nOther liabilities 17,850 16,816\nTotal liabilities $ 2,315,398 $ 2,417,984\nThe Company holds one variable interest in a nonconsolidated VIE established as a result of a pass-through Fund arrangement as further explained in\nNote 10, Pass-Through Financing Obligations. The Company does not have material exposure to losses as a result of its involvement with the VIE in excess of\nthe amount of the pass-through financing obligation recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company is not considered the primary\nbeneficiary of these VIE.\nNote 12. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nDuring certain specified periods of time, noncontrolling interests in certain funding arrangements have the right to put all of their membership interests to\nthe Company. During a specific period of time, the Company has the right to call all membership units of the related redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n30\nNote 13.

The exercise price of each warrant is $0.01 per share, and 13,939 warrants were exercised during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. There were 47,810 warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recognized stock-based\ncompensation expense of nil and $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and nil and $3.2 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under performance and time-based warrants.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company’s 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), as amended, eligible employees are offered shares bi-annually through a 24-\nmonth offering period with six-month purchase periods. Each purchase period begins on the first trading day on or after May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nEmployees may purchase a limited number of shares of the Company’s common stock via regular payroll deductions at a discount of 15% of the lower of the\nfair market value of the Company’s common stock (i) on the first trading date of each offering period or (ii) on the exercise date. Employees may deduct up to\n15% of payroll, with a cap of $25,000 of fair market value of the Company’s common stock in any calendar year and 10,000 shares of the Company’s common\nstock per employee per purchase period.\n31\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense, including ESPP expenses, in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of customer agreements and incentives $ 2,143 $ 2,335 $ 6,388 $ 6,224\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 463 1,153 1,552 4,415\nSales and marketing 11,453 14,096 38,444 43,808\nResearch and development 1,117 405 8,191 1,299\nGeneral and administration 11,816 9,734 29,381 28,480\nTotal $ 26,992 $ 27,723 $ 83,956 $ 84,226\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to solar energy systems, net in the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets was $2.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively, and was $3.4 million and $8.6 million during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nThe income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.2% and (2.1)%, respectively, and for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.7% and 0.5%, respectively. The differences between the actual consolidated effective income tax rate and the U.S.\nfederal statutory rate were primarily attributable to the allocation of losses on noncontrolling interests, income tax benefit from transferring investment tax\ncredits, income tax expense related to the valuation allowance, and the goodwill impairment charge in 2023.\nThe Company sells solar energy systems to investment Funds. As the investment Funds are consolidated by the Company, the gain on the sale of the\nassets has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, however gains on sale are recognized for tax purposes and the tax effects of which, both\ncurrent and deferred, are included in the Company’s income tax provision.\nThe Company enters into investment tax credit transfer (each, an \"ITC\" and collectively, the \"ITCs\") agreements with third-party transferees to transfer to\nsuch third-parties, for cash, the ITCs generated by certain solar energy systems that have been or will be placed in service. The Company accounts for its\nshare of ITC transfer proceeds under ASC 740, Income Taxes, as a reduction of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations during the\nyear in which the credits arise (i.e., the flow-through method) and the tax equity investor’s share is distributed upon receipt. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 the Company recognized income tax benefit to the Company of $13.8 million and $32.4 million, respectively. There was no such\ncomparable activity recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNote 15. Commitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $32.4 million and $37.0 million, respectively, of unused letters of credit\noutstanding, which each carry fees of 0.50% - 3.25% per annum and 0.50% - 3.25% per annum, respectively.\nGuarantees\nCertain tax equity funds and debt facilities require the Company to maintain an aggregate amount of $35.0 million of unencumbered cash and cash\nequivalents at the end of each month.\n32\nPurchase Commitment\nThe Company entered into purchase commitments, which have the ability to be canceled without significant penalties, with multiple suppliers to purchase\n$125.4 million of photovoltaic modules, inverters and batteries by the end of the first quarter of 2025.\nWarranty Accrual\nThe Company accrues warranty costs when revenue is recognized for solar energy systems sales, based on the estimated future costs of meeting its\nwarranty obligations. Warranty costs primarily consist of replacement costs for supplies and labor costs for service personnel since warranties for equipment\nand materials are covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty (other than a small deductible in certain cases). As such, the warranty reserve is immaterial\nin all periods presented. The Company makes and revises these estimates based on the number of solar energy systems under warranty, the Company’s\nhistorical experience with warranty claims, assumptions on warranty claims to occur over a systems’ warranty period and the Company’s estimated\nreplacement costs. A warranty is provided for solar energy systems sold. However, for the solar energy systems under Customer Agreements, the Company\ndoes not accrue a warranty liability because those systems are owned by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. Instead, any repair costs on those solar\nenergy systems are expensed when they are incurred as a component of customer agreements and incentives costs of revenue.\nCommercial ITC Indemnification\nThe Company is contractually committed to compensate its investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from\nreductions in Commercial ITCs, including any reduction in depreciable basis. Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the\nunderlying solar energy systems as assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). The Company set the purchase prices and claimed values based on\nfair market values determined with the assistance of an independent third-party appraisal with respect to the systems that generate Commercial ITCs (and the\nassociated depreciable basis) that are passed-through to, and claimed by, the Fund investors. In April 2018, the Company purchased an insurance policy\nproviding for certain payments by the insurers in the event there is a final determination (including a judicial determination) that reduced the Commercial ITCs\nand depreciation claimed in respect of solar energy systems sold or transferred to most Funds through April 2018, or later, in the case of Funds added to the\npolicy after such date. In general, the policy indemnifies the Company and related parties for additional taxes (including penalties and interest) owed in respect\nof lost Commercial ITCs, depreciation, gross-up costs and expenses incurred in defending such claim, subject to negotiated exclusions from, and limitations to,\ncoverage. The Company purchased similar additional insurance policies in January 2021, October 2022, and May 2023.\nAt each balance sheet date, the Company assesses and recognizes, when applicable, the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the\ninformation available at that time, including any audits undertaken by the IRS. The IRS is auditing one of the Company’s investors in an audit involving a review\nof the fair market value determination of the Company’s solar energy systems in the investment fund, which is covered by the Company’s 2018 insurance\npolicy. If this audit results in an adverse final determination, the Company may be subject to an indemnity obligation to its investor, which may result in certain\nlimited out-of-pocket costs and potential increased insurance premiums in the future.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, investigations, and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. The\nCompany records a provision for a liability when it is both probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably\nestimated. The Company evaluates the adequacy of its legal reserves based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of the law and\nassumptions that ultimately may or may not be correct about the future outcome of each case based on available information. These provisions, if any, are\nreviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events\npertaining to a particular case. Depending on the nature and timing of any such proceedings that may arise, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could\nmaterially affect the Company’s future consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position in a particular period.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has from time to time been named as a party to various legal claims, actions, or complaints. While the\noutcome of these matters cannot currently be predicted with certainty,\n33\nthe Company does not currently believe that the outcome of any of these claims will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on its\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNote 16. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nPotentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive.\nThe computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (83,766) $ (1,069,459) $ (32,510) $ (1,254,373)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares used to compute net\nloss per share attributable to common\nstockholders, basic 223,695 217,344 222,078 216,029\nWeighted average effect of potentially dilutive\nshares to purchase common stock — — — —\nWeighted average shares used to compute\nnet loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders, diluted 223,695 217,344 222,078 216,029\nNet loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders\nBasic $ (0.37) $ (4.92) $ (0.15) $ (5.81)\nDiluted $ (0.37) $ (4.92) $ (0.15) $ (5.81)\nThe following shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share as the impact of including those shares would be anti-\ndilutive (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOutstanding stock options 1,315 1,516 1,755 1,529\nUnvested restricted stock units 2,568 8,663 7,924 6,840\nConvertible Senior Notes (if converted) 30,783 3,392 14,976 2,262\nTotal 34,666 13,571 24,655 10,631\n34\nNote 17.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such\ndifferences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nSunrun’s (the “Company,” “our,” “we”) mission is to connect people to the cleanest energy on earth. Sunrun transformed the solar industry in 2007 by\nremoving financial barriers and democratizing access to locally-generated, renewable energy. Today, Sunrun is the nation’s leading provider of clean energy as\na subscription service, offering residential solar and storage with no upfront costs. Sunrun’s innovative products and solutions can connect homes to the\ncleanest energy on earth, providing them with energy security, predictability, and peace of mind. Sunrun also manages energy services that benefit\ncommunities, utilities, and the electric grid while enhancing customer value.\nWe are engaged in the design, development, installation, sale, ownership and maintenance of residential solar energy systems (“Projects”) in the\nUnited States. We provide clean, solar energy typically at savings compared to traditional utility energy. Our primary customers are residential homeowners. We\nalso offer battery storage along with solar energy systems to our customers in select markets and sell our services to certain commercial developers through\nour multi-family and new homes offerings. After inventing the residential solar service model and recognizing its enormous market potential, we have built the\ninfrastructure and capabilities necessary to rapidly acquire and serve customers in a low-cost and scalable manner. Today, our scalable operating platform\nprovides us with a number of unique advantages. First, we are able to drive distribution by marketing our solar service offerings through multiple channels,\nincluding our diverse partner network and direct-to-consumer operations. This multi-channel model supports broad sales and installation capabilities, which\ntogether allow us to achieve capital-efficient growth. Second, we are able to provide differentiated solutions to our customers that, combined with a great\ncustomer experience, we believe will drive meaningful margin advantages for us over the long term as we strive to create the industry’s most valuable and\nsatisfied customer base.\nOur core solar service offerings are provided through our lease and power purchase agreements, which we refer to as our “Customer Agreements,” and\nwhich provide customers with simple, predictable pricing for solar energy that is insulated from rising retail electricity prices. They also provide customers who\nopt for storage offerings the benefit of increased resiliency from backup energy and enhanced energy management capabilities. While customers have the\noption to purchase a solar energy system outright from us, most of our customers choose to buy solar as a service from us through our Customer Agreements\nwithout the significant upfront investment of purchasing a solar energy system. With our solar service offerings, we install solar energy systems on our\ncustomers’ homes and provide them with the solar power produced by those systems for typically a 20- or 25-year initial term. In addition, we monitor, maintain\nand insure the system during the term of the contract. In exchange, we receive predictable cash flows from high credit quality customers and qualify for tax and\nother benefits. We finance portions of these tax benefits and cash flows through tax equity, non-recourse debt and project equity structures in order to fund our\nupfront costs, overhead and growth investments. We develop valuable customer relationships that can extend beyond this initial contract term and provide us\nan opportunity over time to integrate additional solar, battery storage, electrification and distributed power plant offerings into a smart solution for each home\nand community. Since our founding, we have continued to invest in a platform of services and tools to enable large scale operations for us and our partner\nnetwork, and these partners include solar integrators, sales partners, installation partners and other strategic partners. The platform includes processes and\nsoftware, as well as fulfillment and acquisition of marketing leads. We believe our platform empowers new market entrants and smaller industry participants to\nprofitably serve our large and underpenetrated market without making the significant investments in technology and infrastructure required to compete\neffectively against established industry players. Our platform provides the support for our multi-channel model, which drives broad customer reach and capital-\nefficient growth.\nDelivering a differentiated customer experience is core to our strategy. We emphasize a customized solution, including a design specific to each\ncustomer’s home and pricing configurations that typically drive both customer savings and value to us. We believe that our passion for engaging our customers,\ndeveloping a trusted brand, and providing a customized solar service offering resonates with our customers who are accustomed to a traditional residential\npower market that is often overpriced and lacking in customer choice.\n36\nWe have experienced substantial growth in our business and operations since our inception in 2007, as well as through our acquisition of Vivint Solar on\nOctober 8, 2020. As of September 30, 2024, we operate the largest fleet of residential solar energy systems in the United States. We have a Networked Solar\nEnergy Capacity of 7,288 megawatts as of September 30, 2024, which represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems\nthat have been recognized as deployments, from our inception through the measurement date. Gross Earning Assets as of September 30, 2024 were\napproximately $16.8 billion. Please see the section entitled “Key Operating Metrics” for more details on how we calculate Networked Solar Energy Capacity and\nGross Earning Assets.\nWe also have a long track record of attracting low-cost capital from diverse sources, including tax equity and debt investors. Since inception we have\nraised tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems.\nMarket & Macroeconomic Environment\nOur business and financial performance also depend on worldwide economic conditions. We face global macroeconomic challenges, particularly in light\nof increases and volatility in interest rates, uncertainty in markets, inflationary trends, navigating complex and evolving regulatory and tax frameworks, and the\ndynamics of the global trade environment. During fiscal year 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we observed market uncertainty, increasing\ninflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the market impacts of proposed or newly enacted regulatory frameworks in markets within which we do business\nand within our industry, supply constraints, and bank failures. In particular, rising interest rates, including recent historic increases starting in 2021, have\nresulted and may continue to result in a decrease in our advance rates, reducing the proceeds we receive from certain investment funds. Because our financing\nstructure is sensitive to volatility in interest rates, higher rates increase our cost of capital and may decrease the amount of capital available to us to finance the\ndeployment of new solar energy systems. These market dynamics, some of which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future, have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact our business and financial results.\nIn December 2022, California made changes to its net metering policy by adopting Net Billing Tariff (“NBT”), which presents a significant change to the\nrate structure for new California customers, and has partially limited the financial attractiveness of our offerings in certain regions of the state, particularly for\nsolar-only systems. However, under this new policy, the value proposition of storage offerings is significantly enhanced. We believe that California will be\npredominantly a solar plus storage market going forward and the vast majority of California sales now consist of either our Sunrun Shift product or our backup\nbattery offerings. As the demand for solar plus storage offerings grows, we anticipate facing additional operational challenges associated with the complexity of\ndeploying storage solutions. For example, solar plus storage offerings tend to have longer cycle times due to factors such as lengthened permitting and\ninspection times and potential need of a main panel upgrade. Any such factors that extend the timeframes from customer signature to installation have\nhistorically resulted in increased operational challenges and correspondingly lower realization rates, and any future instances may continue to do so.\nAccordingly, this may adversely affect our financial performance, as well as the timing and magnitude of our installations and the recognition of the associated\nrevenue.\nUnder the new NBT framework, the value proposition of our products is best understood when customers compare the combined costs of their utility bill\nalong with their Sunrun solar and storage bill, due to the impact of time-of-use rates and export rates. The solar industry in California is adjusting from selling\nbased on the value of solar-only to a more complicated rate design with NBT. We believe the best customer offering is one that pairs solar and storage,\nalthough it may be more confusing to customers when compared to solar-only offerings from competitors. This dynamic may result in less sales efficacy so long\nas customers continue to be presented with inferior, but simpler, solar-only offerings and as a result, may harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations, and may also harm the reputation of the solar industry in California at large.\nSince implementation of NBT, originations in California have continued to be below levels prior to the transition for us and across the residential solar\nindustry. Without further increases in originations, our new installations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.\nWe have also recently seen new market entrants paying significantly higher turnkey prices and sales commissions than prevailing industry norms.\nAlthough we believe this to be an economically unsustainable practice, in the short term, it has contributed to increased competition in the industry.\n37\nThe Opportunity of Home Electrification and a Clean, Resilient Grid\nThe United States is on the precipice of a once-in-a-generation transformation of our energy system. The decarbonization of the American economy will\nrequire powering our energy supply, including our homes, appliances and automobiles, with clean energy. Sunrun’s next goal and chapter of growth is to be the\ngo-to company for clean and reliable home electrification, providing our customers with affordable renewable energy throughout their homes and our\ncommunities with a cleaner, more resilient grid.\nWe intend to pursue these opportunities on a variety of fronts, and we continue to pursue the development of our grid services business, creating virtual\npower plants that lead to a cleaner, more resilient grid. In collaboration with grid managers, we can deploy our battery systems where they will add the most\nvalue for utilities, the grid, and customers. We are actively delivering demand response and capacity services to meet operational needs in multiple\ngeographies, and partnering with grid managers to build a more resilient electricity system that integrates the new energy technologies customers want.\nWe believe the electrification of U.S. households with renewable energy, and the accompanying development of an inter-connected, smart grid will\nprovide a number of market opportunities beyond our traditional solar and battery storage offerings, including EV chargers, battery retrofits, re-powered or\nexpanding systems, home energy management services, and other home electrification products. Additionally, we believe our omni-channel model and\ngeographic reach provides us with the capabilities to execute on these opportunities in a variety of markets.\nTo further expand such future upsell and retrofit opportunities, from time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of previously installed solar systems.\nWhile we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material portion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions\nopportunistically. For instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed a strategic transaction that added approximately 2,000 Customers and 13 MW\nof Networked Solar Energy Capacity.\nIn sum, we believe the electrification of the U.S. economy with renewable energy presents an unprecedented economic opportunity, as well as our\ncountry’s best path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Through these electrification opportunities and our grid services business, we aim to be the\nconsumer brand synonymous with repowering our customers’ homes with renewable energy and providing a pathway to a cleaner, healthier future.\n2024 Election\nAs a result of the recent election, we are in a period of transition in both the White House and Congress. The policy implications of these political shifts\nremain uncertain, and we may face changes or delays in policies that affect our business, including those related to federal tax credits, tariffs, and other\nregulatory measures. Any delay, reduction, or elimination in the implementation of policies that support the residential solar industry, such as the Investment Tax\nCredit and adders under the Inflation Reduction Act, could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, the election outcome could contribute to a\nhigher interest rate environment, which may further negatively impact our operations and financing costs. While it is difficult to predict specific outcomes at this\ntime, we expect a period of regulatory and policy uncertainty in the near term. However, we believe our diversified business model and flexible operational\nframework position us to adapt to potential changes in the regulatory landscape and will continue to build on the robust bi-partisan support for residential solar\npolicy.\nInvestment Funds\nOur Customer Agreements provide for recurring customer payments, typically over 20 or 25 years, and the related solar energy systems are generally\neligible for Commercial ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other government or utility incentives. Our financing strategy is to monetize these benefits at a\nlow weighted average cost of capital. This low cost of capital enables us to offer attractive pricing to our customers for the energy generated by the solar energy\nsystem on their homes. Historically, we have monetized a portion of the value created by our Customer Agreements and the related solar energy systems\nthrough investment funds. These assets are attractive to fund investors due to the long-term, recurring nature of the cash flows generated by our Customer\nAgreements, the high credit scores of our customers, the fact that energy is a non-discretionary good and our low loss rates. In addition, fund investors can\nreceive attractive after-tax returns from our investment funds due to their ability to utilize\n38\nCommercial ITCs, accelerated depreciation and certain government or utility incentives associated with the funds’ ownership of solar energy systems.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 62 active investment funds, which are described below. We have established different types of investment funds to\nimplement our asset monetization strategy. Depending on the nature of the investment fund, cash may be contributed to the investment fund by the investor\nupfront or in stages based on milestones associated with the design, construction or interconnection status of the solar energy systems. The cash contributed\nby the fund investor is used by the investment fund to purchase solar energy systems. The investment funds either own or enter into a master lease with a\nSunrun subsidiary for the solar energy systems, Customer Agreements and associated incentives. We receive on-going cash distributions from the investment\nfunds representing a portion of the monthly customer payments received. We use the upfront cash, as well as on-going distributions to cover our costs\nassociated with designing, purchasing and installing the solar energy systems. In addition, we also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our\noperations. The allocation of the economic benefits between us and the fund investor and the corresponding accounting treatment varies depending on the\nstructure of the investment fund.\nWe currently utilize two legal structures in our investment funds, which we refer to as: (i) pass-through financing obligations, and (ii) partnership flips.\nWe reflect pass-through financing obligations on our consolidated balance sheet as a pass-through financing obligation. We record the investor’s interest in\npartnership flips as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests. If redemption is at our option, we record the investor’s interest as a\nnoncontrolling interest and account for the interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. If the investor has the option to put their\ninterest to us, we record the investor’s interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at the greater of the HLBV and the redemption value.\nThe table below provides an overview of our current investment funds (dollars in millions):\nPass-Through Financing\nObligations Partnership Flip\nConsolidation Owner entity consolidated, tenant Single entity, consolidated\nentity not consolidated\nBalance sheet classification Pass-through financing obligation Redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests and noncontrolling\ninterests\nRevenue from Commercial ITCs Recognized on the permission to None\noperate (“PTO”) date\nMethod of calculating investor interest Effective interest rate method Greater of HLBV or redemption\nvalue\nLiability balance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1.1 N/A\nNoncontrolling interest balance (redeemable or otherwise) as of September 30, N/A $ 1,756.4\n2024\nFor further information regarding our investment funds, including the associated risks, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors— “Our ability to provide our\nsolar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek\nparticular tax and other benefits”, Note 10, Pass-Through Financing Obligations, Note 11, VIE Arrangements, and Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling\nInterests to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n39\nKey Operating Metrics\nThe following operating metrics are used by management to evaluate the performance of the business. Management believes these metrics provide\ninvestors with helpful information to determine the economic performance of the business activities in a period that would otherwise not be observable from\nhistoric GAAP measures. We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our\nperformance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Some of our key operating metrics are\nestimates that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Although we believe that we\nhave a reasonable basis for each of these estimates, we caution you that these estimates are based on a combination of assumptions that may prove to be\ninaccurate over time. Any inaccuracies could be material to our actual results when compared to our calculations. Please see the section titled “Risk Factors” in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Furthermore, other companies may calculate these metrics differently than we do now or in the future,\nwhich would reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n• Networked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to\ncustomers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed, subject to final inspection; or\n(ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of\nacquisitions of installed systems). Systems that have met these criteria are considered to be deployed. We believe it is helpful to investors to evaluate\nnetworked solar energy capacity added during the period in order to measure the growth of our business as a whole, whether sold directly to customers\nor subject to executed Customer Agreements.\n• Gross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n◦ Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) during the\ninitial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at\n6%) we expect to receive from Subscribers in future periods, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs based on the\nservice agreements underlying each fund, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in partnership flip\nstructures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from tax equity\npartners, government incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows\nfrom grid service programs with utility or grid operators.\n◦ Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial\nCustomer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation (either in the form of cash payments during any\napplicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate\nthe Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a\nrenewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the\nsystem), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer’s contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial\ncontract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew annually or for a five year term and the rate is initially set at up to\na 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n◦ Subscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as deployments through\nthe measurement date.\n• Customers represent the cumulative number of deployments, from our inception through the measurement date. We believe that it is helpful to investors\nto evaluate customers added during the period in order to measure the growth of our business as a whole.\nGross Earning Assets is forecasted as of a specific date. It is forward-looking, and we use judgment in developing the assumptions used to calculate it.\nFactors that could impact Gross Earning Assets include, but are not limited to, customer payment defaults, or declines in utility rates or early termination\nof a contract\n40\nin certain circumstances, including prior to installation. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate the future expected cash flows from all customers\nthat have been deployed through the respective measurement date, less estimated costs to maintain such systems and estimated distributions to tax\nequity partners in partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. Various assumptions are made when calculating these metrics.\nGross Earning Assets utilize a 6% unlevered discount rate (weighted average cost of capital or “WACC”) to discount future cash flows to the present\nperiod. Furthermore, this metric assumes that customers renew after the initial contract period at a rate equal to 90% of the rate in effect at the end of\nthe initial contract term. For Customer Agreements with 25-year initial contract terms, a 5-year renewal period is assumed. For a 20-year initial contract\nterm, a 10-year renewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although the customer may renew for\nadditional years, or purchase the system. Estimated cost of servicing assets has been deducted and is estimated based on the service agreements\nunderlying each fund.\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity (megawatts) 7,288 6,462\nCustomers 1,015,910 903,270\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period $ 12,964,438 $ 10,064,328\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period 3,815,274 3,235,066\nGross Earning Assets $ 16,779,712 $ 13,299,394\nThe tables below provide a range of Gross Earning Asset amounts if different default, discount and purchase and renewal assumptions were used.\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDiscount rate\nDefault rate 4% 5% 6% 7% 8%\n(in thousands)\n5% $ 15,060,780 $ 13,742,642 $ 12,598,730 $ 11,601,639 $ 10,728,777\n0% $ 15,523,626 $ 14,153,111 $ 12,964,438 $ 11,928,938 $ 11,022,983\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDiscount rate\nPurchase or Renewal rate 4% 5% 6% 7% 8%\n(in thousands)\n80% $ 4,884,907 $ 4,011,357 $ 3,308,350 $ 2,740,204 $ 2,279,136\n90% $ 5,631,096 $ 4,625,014 $ 3,815,274 $ 3,160,800 $ 2,629,609\n100% $ 6,377,283 $ 5,238,669 $ 4,322,196 $ 3,581,394 $ 2,980,080\n41\nTotal Gross Earning Assets:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDiscount rate\nPurchase or Renewal rate 4% 5% 6% 7% 8%\n(in thousands)\n80% $ 20,408,533 $ 18,164,468 $ 16,272,788 $ 14,669,141 $ 13,302,119\n90% $ 21,154,722 $ 18,778,125 $ 16,779,712 $ 15,089,737 $ 13,652,591\n100% $ 21,900,908 $ 19,391,779 $ 17,286,634 $ 15,510,332 $ 14,003,063\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and\nin other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Actual results could differ significantly from our\nestimates. Our future financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. For further information on\nall of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed on February 21, 2024.\nWe believe that policies associated with our principles of consolidation, revenue recognition, goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, provision for\nincome taxes, business combinations and calculation of noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests have the greatest impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled\nto in exchange for those goods or services.\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives Revenue. Customer agreements and incentives revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from our Customer\nAgreements and sales of Commercial ITCs and SRECs to third parties.\nWe begin to recognize revenue from a Customer Agreement when PTO for the applicable solar energy system is given by the local utility company or on\nthe date daily operation commences if utility approval is not required. For Customer Agreements that include a fixed fee per month which entitles the customer\nto any and all electricity generated by the system, we recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance obligations over the initial term of\nCustomer Agreements. For Customer Agreements that charge a fixed price per kilowatt hour, revenue is recognized based on the actual amount of power\ngenerated at rates specified under the contracts. Customer Agreements typically have an initial term of 20 or 25 years. After the initial contract term, our\nCustomer Agreements typically automatically renew annually or for a five year term.\nWe also apply for and receive SRECs associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and sell them to third parties in certain\njurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related to possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than\ncontractually committed, and is generally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nCertain upfront payments related to Customer Agreements and SRECs are deemed to have a financing component, and therefore increase both revenue\nand interest expense by the same amount over the term of the related agreement. The additional revenue is included in the total transaction price to be\nrecorded over the term of the agreement and is recognized based on the timing of the delivery. The interest expense is recognized based upon an amortization\nschedule which typically decreases throughout the term of the related agreement.\n42\nFor pass-through financing obligation funds, the value attributable to the Commercial ITCs is recognized in the period a solar system is granted PTO, at\nwhich point we have met our obligation to the investor. The Commercial ITCs are subject to recapture under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) if the\nunderlying solar energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date. The\nrecapture amount decreases on the anniversary of the PTO date. We have not historically incurred a material recapture of Commercial ITCs, and do not expect\nto experience a material recapture of Commercial ITCs in the future.\nConsideration from customers is considered variable due to the performance guarantee under Customer Agreements and liquidated damage provisions\nunder SREC contracts in the event minimum deliveries are not achieved. Customer Agreements with a performance guarantee provide a credit to the customer\nif the system’s cumulative production, as measured on various PTO anniversary dates, is below our guarantee of a specified minimum. Revenue is recognized\nto the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. If our estimate of the future production shortfall amount for Customer\nAgreements with a performance guarantee was 10% higher, the additional reduction to revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have\nbeen less than $3.7 million. Our estimated production shortfall reduced revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by $7.2 million more than\nthe prior year’s period. We have historically estimated an immaterial amount of liquidated damages pursuant to SREC contracts, and actual damages have not\nbeen materially different from estimates, nor material in amount during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Solar energy systems sales are revenue from the sale of solar energy systems directly to customers. We\ngenerally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to customers when the solar energy system passes inspection by the authority having jurisdiction,\nwhich inspection generally occurs after installation but prior to PTO, at which time we have met the performance obligation in the contract. For solar energy\nsystem sales that include delivery obligations up until interconnection to the local power grid with permission to operate, we recognize revenue at PTO. Certain\nsolar energy systems sold to customers include fees for extended warranty and maintenance services. These fees are recognized over the life of the service\nagreement.\nProduct sales revenue consists of revenue from the sale of solar panels, inverters, racking systems, roof repair, and other solar energy products sold to\nresellers, as well as the sale of customer leads to third parties, including our partners and other solar providers. Product sales revenue is recognized when\ncontrol is transferred, generally upon shipment, or as services are delivered. Customer lead revenue is recognized at the time the lead is delivered.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment\nat least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. We have determined that we operate as\none reporting unit and our goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill on October 1 of each\nfiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment,\nwe use qualitative and if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Goodwill. We also consider our enterprise value and if\nnecessary, a discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and estimates, including our future financial performance, weighted average cost of\ncapital and interpretation of currently enacted tax laws.\nCircumstances that could indicate impairment and require us to perform a quantitative impairment test include a significant decline in our financial results,\na significant decline in our enterprise value relative to our net book value, a sustained decline in our stock price, or an unanticipated change in competition or\nour market share and a significant change in our strategic plans. A sustained decrease in the price of our common stock is one of the qualitative factors to be\nconsidered as part of an impairment test when evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances may indicate that it is more likely than not that a\npotential goodwill impairment exists. Due to the continued sustained decline in our market capitalization after consideration of a control premium below the book\nvalue of equity, we recorded an impairment charge as of September 30, 2023 related to the recoverability of our goodwill for our one reporting unit. After the\nimpairment charge, the fair value of our one reporting unit approximated its estimated carrying value. As of October 1, 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill\nimpairment test. The test concluded that no additional impairment had occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n43\nShould, among other events and circumstances, industry conditions deteriorate, the outlook for future operating results and cash flow decline or\nregulations change, costs of equity or debt capital increase, valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations decrease, or our\nmarket capitalization experience a further sustained decline below its book value, we may need to further reassess the recoverability of goodwill in future\nperiods. As of September 30, 2024, there were no indicators of goodwill impairment that would require an interim goodwill impairment test.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying values of our long-lived assets, including solar energy systems, are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Factors that we\nconsider in deciding when to perform an impairment review would include significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned\nchanges in our use of the assets. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying value of each asset group to the future\nundiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is\nmeasured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize\nthe remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no indicators\nof impairment and therefore no cash flow analysis was performed.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOur noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent fund investors’ interests in the net assets of certain investment funds,\nwhich we consolidate, that we have entered into in order to finance the costs of solar energy facilities under Customer Agreements. We have determined that\nthe provisions in the contractual arrangements of the investment funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, which gives rise to the noncontrolling\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We have further determined that for all but two of these arrangements, the appropriate methodology for\nattributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV\nmethod.\nAttributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method requires the use of various\ninputs to calculate the amounts that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation. Changes in these inputs, including change in tax rates, can\nhave a significant impact on the amount that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation.\nWe classify certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control outside of permanent equity on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported using the greater of their carrying value at each reporting date as determined\nby the HLBV method or their estimated redemption value in each reporting period. Estimating the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests\nrequires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such as projected future cash flows at the time the redemption feature can be exercised.\n44\nWe determine the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by deducting from net income (loss), the net income (loss) attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in these funds. The net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests represents the fund investors’ allocable share in the results of operations of these investment funds. For these funds, we have\ndetermined that the provisions in the contractual arrangements represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, where the allocations to the partners\nsometimes differ from the stated ownership percentages. We have further determined that, for these arrangements, the appropriate methodology for attributing\nincome and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method.\nUnder the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated\nstatements of operations reflect changes in the amounts the fund investors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation\nprovisions of the contractual provisions of these funds, assuming the net assets of the respective investment funds were liquidated at the carrying value\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP. The fund investors’ interest in the results of operations of these investment funds is initially determined by calculating the\ndifference in the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests’ claim under the HLBV method at the start and end of each reporting period,\nafter taking into account any contributions and distributions between the fund and the fund investors and subject to the redemption provisions in certain funds.\nThe calculation of HLBV does not require estimates since each HLBV calculation is based upon the liquidation provisions of each fund’s contractual\nagreement. The calculation of the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance involves estimates such as a discount rate used in net present value calculations,\nand customer default rates. If the assumptions used for each of these were 10% higher, the impact to the aggregate redeemable noncontrolling interest balance\nas of September 30, 2024 would be a reduction of $21.6 million.\n45\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenue:\nCustomer agreements and incentives $ 405,861 $ 316,528 $ 1,116,653 $ 865,151\nSolar energy systems and product\nsales 131,312 246,653 402,574 878,072\nTotal revenue 537,173 563,181 1,519,227 1,743,223\nOperating expenses:\nCost of customer agreements and\nincentives 308,382 283,742 876,581 789,334\nCost of solar energy systems and\nproduct sales 125,312 234,274 411,591 824,830\nSales and marketing 162,490 176,349 466,411 574,061\nResearch and development 8,180 5,039 30,510 14,153\nGeneral and administrative 60,587 53,254 173,082 163,957\nGoodwill impairment — 1,158,000 — 1,158,000\nTotal operating expenses 664,951 1,910,658 1,958,175 3,524,335\nLoss from operations (127,778) (1,347,477) (438,948) (1,781,112)\nInterest expense, net (215,615) (171,288) (614,981) (471,163)\nOther (expense) income, net (82,598) 77,673 71,710 93,744\nLoss before income taxes (425,991) (1,441,092) (982,219) (2,158,531)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (13,803) 29,846 (26,953) (11,096)\nNet loss (412,188) (1,470,938) (955,266) (2,147,435)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests (328,422) (401,479) (922,756) (893,062)\nNet loss attributable to common\nstockholders $ (83,766) $ (1,069,459) $ (32,510) $ (1,254,373)\nNet loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders\nBasic $ (0.37) $ (4.92) $ (0.15) $ (5.81)\nDiluted $ (0.37) $ (4.92) $ (0.15) $ (5.81)\nWeighted average shares used to\ncompute loss per share attributable to\ncommon stockholders\nBasic 223,695 217,344 222,078 216,029\nDiluted 223,695 217,344 222,078 216,029\n46\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCustomer agreements $ 368,641 $ 289,678 $ 78,963 27 %\nIncentives 37,220 26,850 10,370 39 %\nCustomer agreements and incentives 405,861 316,528 89,333 28 %\nSolar energy systems 47,189 135,476 (88,287) (65)%\nProducts 84,123 111,177 (27,054) (24)%\nSolar energy systems and product sales 131,312 246,653 (115,341) (47)%\nTotal revenue $ 537,173 $ 563,181 $ (26,008) (5)%\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives. The $79.0 million increase in Revenue from Customer Agreements was primarily due to new systems placed in\nservice in the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, plus a full quarter of revenue recognized in 2024 for systems placed in service in the\nthird quarter of 2023 versus only a partial amount of such revenue related to the period in which the assets were in service in 2023. Revenue from incentives\nconsisted primarily of sales of SRECs. The $10.4 million increase related to the timing and volume of SREC sales, which were responsive to market conditions.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Revenue from solar energy systems sales decreased by $88.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due\nto an increase in the proportion of customers choosing to enter into a Customer Agreement versus purchasing a system outright using a loan for cash or using\na third party loan, likely due to increased interest rates. Product sales decreased by $27.1 million, primarily due to the lower average sales price of solar energy\nproducts, as well as lower sales volume of solar energy products to installers of solar energy systems compared to the prior year, due to easing of supply chain\nconstraints.\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCost of customer agreements and incentives $ 308,382 $ 283,742 $ 24,640 9 %\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 125,312 234,274 (108,962) (47)%\nSales and marketing 162,490 176,349 (13,859) (8)%\nResearch and development 8,180 5,039 3,141 62 %\nGeneral and administrative 60,587 53,254 7,333 14 %\nGoodwill impairment — 1,158,000 (1,158,000) 100 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 664,951 $ 1,910,658 $ (1,245,707) (65)%\nCost of Customer Agreements and Incentives. The $24.6 million increase in Cost of customer agreements and incentives was primarily due to the new\nsystems placed in service in the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, plus a full quarter of costs recognized in the third quarter of 2024 for\nsystems placed in service in the third quarter of 2023 versus only a partial amount of such expenses related to the period in which the assets were in service in\n2023.\nThe Cost of customer agreements and incentives decreased to 76% of revenue from customer agreements and incentives during the three months\nended September 30, 2024, from 90% during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to customer pricing increases\ncatching up to costs.\n47\nCost of Solar Energy Systems and Product Sales. The $109.0 million decrease in Cost of solar energy systems and product sales was primarily due to\nthe corresponding net decrease in the solar energy systems and product sales discussed above.\nThe Cost of solar energy systems and product sales remained consistent at 95% of revenue from Solar energy systems and product sales during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nSales and Marketing Expense. The $13.9 million decrease in Sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to decreases in headcount driving\nlower employee compensation and costs to acquire customers through our sales lead generating partners. Included in Sales and marketing expense is $20.9\nmillion and $13.5 million of amortization of costs to obtain Customer Agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense. The $3.1 million increase in Research and development expense was primarily attributable to an increase in\nheadcount driving higher employee compensation costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. The $7.3 million increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to information\ntechnology related consulting costs, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation costs.\nGoodwill Impairment. The $1.2 billion decrease in Goodwill impairment expense related to an impairment charge of $1.2 billion that was a result of an\ninterim impairment test performed during the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no such comparable charge in the three months ended September\n30, 2024.\nNon-Operating Expenses, net\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense, net $ (215,615) $ (171,288) $ (44,327) 26 %\nOther (expense) income, net $ (82,598) $ 77,673 $ (160,271) (206)%\nInterest Expense, net.

Investment\nfunds generally allocate more loss to the noncontrolling interest in the first several years after fund formation.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCustomer agreements $ 1,030,859 $ 789,256 $ 241,603 31 %\nIncentives 85,794 75,895 9,899 13 %\nCustomer agreements and incentives 1,116,653 865,151 251,502 29 %\nSolar energy systems 167,535 566,861 (399,326) (70)%\nProducts 235,039 311,211 (76,172) (24)%\nSolar energy systems and product sales 402,574 878,072 (475,498) (54)%\nTotal revenue $ 1,519,227 $ 1,743,223 $ (223,996) (13)%\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives. The $241.6 million increase in Revenue from Customer Agreements was primarily due to new systems placed in\nservice in the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, plus a full nine months of revenue recognized in 2024 for systems placed in service in\nthe first nine months of 2023 versus only a partial amount of such revenue related to the period in which the assets were in service in 2023. Revenue from\nincentives consisted primarily of sales of SRECs. The $9.9 million increase related to the timing and volume of SREC sales, which were responsive to market\nconditions.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Revenue from solar energy systems sales decreased by $399.3 million compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to an increase in the proportion of customers choosing to enter into a Customer Agreement versus purchasing a system outright using a loan, likely due to\nincreased interest rates. Product sales decreased by $76.2 million, primarily due to the lower average sales price of solar energy products, as well as lower\nsales volume of solar energy products to installers of solar energy systems compared to the prior year, due to easing of supply chain constraints and wind-down\nof AEE business.\n49\nOperating Expenses\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCost of customer agreements and incentives $ 876,581 $ 789,334 $ 87,247 11 %\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 411,591 824,830 (413,239) (50)%\nSales and marketing 466,411 574,061 (107,650) (19)%\nResearch and development 30,510 14,153 16,357 116 %\nGeneral and administrative 173,082 163,957 9,125 6 %\nGoodwill impairment — 1,158,000 (1,158,000) (100)%\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,958,175 $ 3,524,335 $ (1,566,160) (44)%\nCost of Customer Agreements and Incentives. The $87.2 million increase in Cost of customer agreements and incentives was primarily due to the new\nsystems placed in service in the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, plus a full nine months of costs recognized in 2024 for systems\nplaced in service in the nine months of 2023 versus only a partial amount of such expenses related to the period in which the assets were in service in 2023.\nThe Cost of customer agreements and incentives decreased to 79% of revenue from customer agreements and incentives during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, from 91% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to customer pricing increases catching up to\ncosts.\nCost of Solar Energy Systems and Product Sales. The $413.2 million decrease in Cost of solar energy systems and product sales was primarily due to\nthe corresponding net decrease in the solar energy systems and product sales discussed above.\nThe Cost of solar energy systems and product sales increased to 102% of revenue from solar energy systems and product sales during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, from 94% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as the result of a $22.1 million increase in inventory\nreserves recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the wind-down of the AEE Solar operations.\nSales and Marketing Expense. The $107.7 million decrease in Sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to decreases in headcount driving\nlower employee compensation and costs to acquire customers through our sales lead generating partners. Included in Sales and marketing expense is $55.2\nmillion and $39.5 million of amortization of costs to obtain Customer Agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense. The $16.4 million increase in Research and development expense was primarily attributable to an increase in\nheadcount driving higher employee compensation costs, as well as an increase in support related consulting costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. The $9.1 million increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in\ninformation technology related consulting costs, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGoodwill Impairment. The $1.2 billion decrease in Goodwill impairment expense related to an impairment charge of $1.2 billion that was a result of an\ninterim impairment test performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no such comparable charge in the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\n50\nNon-Operating Expenses, net\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense, net $ (614,981) $ (471,163) $ (143,818) 31 %\nOther income, net $ 71,710 $ 93,744 $ (22,034) (24)%\nInterest Expense, net. The increase in Interest expense, net of $143.8 million was primarily related to additional non-recourse debt entered into\nsubsequent to September 30, 2023.

The decrease in Other income, net of $22.0 million related primarily to an increase in losses on derivatives during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nIncome tax benefit $ (26,953) $ (11,096) $ (15,857) 143 %\nThe increase in income tax benefit of $15.9 million is primarily attributable to reduced losses allocable to the controlling interest (excluding the goodwill\nimpairment charge in 2023), increased benefit from transferring investment tax credits, and increased expense related to the valuation allowance on federal net\noperating losses in the current year compared to prior year.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests $ (922,756) $ (893,062) $ (29,694) 3 %\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was primarily the result of an addition of 7 new investment funds\nsince September 30, 2023, for which the HLBV method was used in determining the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Investment\nfunds generally allocate more loss to the noncontrolling interest in the first several years after fund formation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash of $533.9 million, which consisted of cash held in checking and savings accounts with financial institutions. We\nfinance our operations mainly through a variety of financing fund arrangements that we have formed with fund investors, cash generated from our sources of\nrevenue and borrowings from secured credit facilities arrangements with syndicates of banks and from secured, long-term non-recourse loan arrangements. In\n2023, we received $1.0 billion of new commitments on secured credit facilities arrangements with syndicates of banks and $0.8 billion of commitments from\nsecured, long-term non-recourse loan arrangements. Our principal uses of cash are funding our business, including the costs of acquisition and installation of\nsolar energy systems, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments and other working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had\noutstanding borrowings of $392.5 million on our $447.5 million credit facility maturing in March 2027. In February 2024, we amended one of our subsidiary’s\nsenior secured credit facility to, among other things, increase the total commitments from $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion and extend the maturity date from April 2025\nto April 2028. In July 2024, we amended the same senior secured credit facility to\n51\nincrease total commitments from $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. In February 2024, we amended our bank line of credit to, among other things, reduce the total\ncommitments from $600.0 million to $447.5 million, and to extend the maturity date from January 2025 to November 2025. As of September 30, 2024, this\nmaturity date was automatically extended to March 1, 2027, due to us maintaining funds on deposit in a collateral account equal to an amount sufficient to\nrepay at the scheduled maturity all of our 0% Senior Convertible Notes due 2026 that are outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and being otherwise in\ncompliance with our quarter-end liquidity covenant.\nAdditionally, we have purchase commitments, which have the ability to be canceled without significant penalties, with multiple suppliers to purchase\n$125.4 million of photovoltaic modules, inverters and batteries by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In February 2024, we issued $475.0 million of convertible\nsenior notes with a maturity date of March 1, 2030, for net proceeds of approximately $470.1 million. Our business model requires substantial outside financing\narrangements to grow the business and facilitate the deployment of additional solar energy systems. The solar energy systems that are operational are\nexpected to generate a positive return rate over the term of the Customer Agreement, typically 20 or 25 years. However, in order to grow, we will continue to be\ndependent on financing from outside parties. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may be required to reduce planned\nspending, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. While there can be no assurances, we anticipate raising additional required capital\nfrom new and existing investors. We believe our cash, investment fund commitments and available borrowings as further described below will be sufficient to\nmeet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations\nthrough a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and available credit via our credit facilities. The following table\nsummarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nConsolidated cash flow data:\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (507,794) $ (704,733)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,908,612) (1,952,019)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 2,439,185 2,655,674\nNet change in cash and restricted cash $ 22,779 $ (1,078)\nOperating Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $507.8 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash outflow\nconsisted of the cost of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our\noperating cash outflows were $344.1 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-operating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash\noutflow of $163.7 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $704.7 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash outflow\nconsisted of the cost of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our\noperating cash outflows were $481.2 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-operating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash\ninflow of $223.5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $1.9 billion in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and\ninstall solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements.\n52\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $2.0 billion in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and\ninstall solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated $2.4 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $1.6 billion in net\nproceeds from debt, $816.6 million in net proceeds from fund investors, $12.0 million in net proceeds from stock-based awards activity, and $5.2 million in\nproceeds from state tax credits, net of recapture, offset by $21.4 million in acquisition of noncontrolling interests and $20.6 million in repayments under finance\nlease obligations.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $2.7 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $1.8 billion in net\nproceeds from debt, $945.7 million in net proceeds from fund investors, $14.2 million in net proceeds from stock-based awards activity, and $4.0 million in\nproceeds from state tax credits, net of recapture, offset by $46.3 million in acquisition of noncontrolling interests and $16.8 million in repayments under finance\nlease obligations.\nDebt and Investment Fund Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had committed and available capital of approximately $405.2 million that may only be used to purchase and install solar\nenergy systems. We intend to establish new investment funds in the future, and we may also use debt, equity or other financing strategies to finance our\nbusiness. For a discussion of the terms and conditions of debt instruments and changes thereof in the period, refer to Note 8, Indebtedness, to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our primary exposure includes changes in interest rates because certain\nborrowings bear interest at floating rates based on SOFR, plus a specified margin. We sometimes manage our interest rate exposure on floating-rate debt by\nentering into derivative instruments to hedge all or a portion of our interest rate exposure in certain debt facilities. We do not enter into any derivative\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense\nand operating expenses and reducing funds available for capital investments, operations and other purposes. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about\nmarket risk, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, filed on February 21, 2024. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn connection with that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms as of September 30, 2024. As such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n53\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-\nbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n54\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nSee Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with\nall of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks\nand uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Solar Industry\nThe solar energy industry is an emerging market which is constantly evolving and may not develop to the size or at the rate we expect.\nThe solar energy industry is an emerging and constantly evolving market opportunity. We believe the solar energy industry is still developing and\nmaturing, and we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at the rate we expect. For example, we have experienced increases in cancellations\nof our Customer Agreements in certain geographic markets during various periods in our operating history. Any future growth of the solar energy market and the\nsuccess of our solar service offerings depend on many factors beyond our control, including recognition and acceptance of the solar service market by\nconsumers, the pricing of alternative sources of energy, a favorable regulatory environment, the continuation of expected tax benefits and other incentives, and\nour ability to provide our solar service offerings cost effectively. If the markets for solar energy do not develop to the size or at the rate we expect, our business\nmay be adversely affected.\nSolar energy has yet to achieve broad market acceptance and depends in part on continued support in the form of rebates, tax credits, and other\nincentives from federal, state and local governments. Additionally, there have been significant changes in the residential solar policy and pricing framework in\nCalifornia, which is one of our key markets and represents over 45% of our customer base. Changes to California’s net metering policy adopted in December\n2022, with the new billing regime implemented in April 2023, present a significant change to the financial benefits California customers receive from our solar\nsystems and may limit the financial attractiveness of our offerings in this market, particularly for solar-only systems. Originations in California are below levels\nprior to the NBT transition, and without further increases in originations, our new installations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. Further, if support diminishes materially for solar policy\nrelated to rebates, tax credits, bill crediting, or other incentives, our ability to obtain external financing on acceptable terms, or at all, could be materially\nadversely affected. These types of funding limitations could lead to inadequate financing support for the anticipated growth in our business. Furthermore,\ngrowth in residential solar energy depends in part on macroeconomic conditions, retail prices of electricity and customer preferences, each of which can change\nquickly. Declining macroeconomic conditions, including in job markets and residential real estate markets, could contribute to instability and uncertainty among\ncustomers and impact their financial wherewithal, credit scores or interest in entering into long-term contracts, even if such contracts would generate immediate\nand long-term savings.\nFurthermore, market prices of retail electricity generated by utilities or other energy sources could decline for a variety of reasons, as discussed further\nbelow. Any declines in macroeconomic conditions, changes in retail prices of electricity or changes in customer preferences would adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nAchieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require an unprecedented transformation of American energy systems and the adoption of a wide variety of\nclean energy, storage, and home electrification solutions. Our successful deployment of such products will depend on several factors outside our control,\nincluding shifting market conditions and policy frameworks. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions, to compete successfully with existing or new\ncompetitors, and to adopt new or enhanced offerings could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\n55\nWe have historically benefited from declining costs in our industry, and our business and financial results may be harmed as a result of recent and\nany continued increases in costs associated with our solar service offerings and any failure of these costs to continue declining as we currently\nexpect. If we do not reduce our cost structure in the future, our ability to continue to be profitable may be impaired.\nDeclining costs related to raw materials, manufacturing and the sale and installation of our solar service offerings have been a key driver in the pricing of\nour solar service offerings and, more broadly, customer adoption of solar energy. While historically the prices of solar panels and raw materials have declined,\nthe cost of solar panels and raw materials have at times increased and may increase in the future, and such products’ availability could decrease, due to a\nvariety of factors, including supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations, geopolitical conflicts, regulatory or contractual\nlimitations, industry market requirements, and changes in technology and industry standards.\nFor example, on April 24, 2024, new antidumping (“AD”) and countervailing duty (“CVD”) petitions were filed against Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and\nVietnam. AD and CVD measures (typically, in the form of tariffs) are used to remedy the economic advantage created by unfair foreign pricing and government\nsubsidies. The U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) is responsible for investigating dumping and subsidization. Preliminary determinations in the AD\ninvestigations are expected to be released around November 27, 2024. Importers would then be required to pay cash deposits (estimated duties) on entries of\ncells and modules from the subject countries. Preliminary determinations in CVD investigations were issued on October 1, 2024 with Commerce finding injury\nand imposing CVD levels that averaged from 8-10% (with specific rates varying depending on the country and the company investigated). If Commerce\ndetermines that “critical circumstances” exist, they will order the retroactive collection of duty deposits for entries made during the 90-day period before the\npublication date of the preliminary determination.\nSimilarly, on February 4, 2022, the Biden Administration announced a four-year extension of the 2018 tariffs imposed in response to a petition filed under\nSection 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “Section 201 Tariffs”). The Biden Administration set the Section 201 Tariffs at 14.75%, with a modest rate reduction\neach year. The decision exempted bifacial modules from the tariffs as well as 5 GW of imported solar cells each year. On May 16, 2024, the Biden\nAdministration announced the removal of the exemption for bifacial modules and those products are now subject to the Section 201 Tariffs.\nIn August 2021, an anonymous group of U.S. solar manufacturers filed petitions with Commerce alleging that Chinese companies were evading\nantidumping and countervailing duty orders on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules, which are used in the production of solar panels. Ultimately,\nCommerce objected to the anonymous nature of the petition, and it expired. Subsequently, on February 8, 2022, Auxin Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel\nmanufacturer, submitted a petition to Commerce to request country-wide circumvention inquiries pursuant to Section 781(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 concerning\ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules assembled in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia using Chinese inputs. On April 1, 2022, Commerce\ninitiated the inquiries, and, after conducting an investigation, issued a preliminary decision on December 2, 2022, recommending that the Biden Administration\nimpose tariffs on certain solar panel imports from the Southeast Asian countries. However, prior to Commerce issuing its preliminary decision, the Biden\nAdministration in June 2022 issued Presidential Proclamation 10414, which paused the collection of any new anti-dumping or countervailing duty of certain\nsolar cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam until June 2024. In December 2023, Auxin Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel\nmanufacturer filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the regulations implementing Presidential Proclamation 10414 and overturn the Biden Administration’s\nmoratorium on additional duties and tariffs on certain solar cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam. In addition, with the\nexpiration of Presidential Proclamation 10414, panel prices may increase.\nIn addition, U.S. laws and regulations intended to prevent the importation of goods manufactured with forced labor has and could continue to affect our\nbusiness operation and supply chain, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and the withhold release order (“WRO”) that U.S. Customs and Border\nProtection (“CBP”) issued on June 24, 2021 applicable to certain silica-based products manufactured in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.\nIntensive examinations, withhold release orders, and related governmental procedures have resulted in supply chain and operational delays throughout the\nindustry, and we have implemented policies and procedures to maintain compliance and minimize delays. These and similar trade restrictions that may be\nimposed in the future could cause delivery and installation delays, and restrict the global supply of polysilicon and solar products. This could result in near-term\ndemand for available solar energy systems despite higher costs, increased costs of polysilicon and the overall cost of solar energy systems, and equipment\nshortages, potentially reducing overall demand for and limiting the supply of our products and services.\n56\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, which\nproducts may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. The tariffs described above, the adoption and\nexpansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs, trade agreements or related policies have the\npotential to adversely impact our supply chain and access to equipment, and our costs and ability to economically serve certain markets. Any such cost\nincreases or decreases in availability could slow our growth and cause our financial results and operational metrics to suffer. We cannot predict whether, and to\nwhat extent, U.S. trade policies will change in the future and cannot ensure that additional tariffs or other restrictive measures will not continue or increase.\nWe face competition from traditional energy companies as well as solar and other renewable energy companies.\nThe solar energy industry is highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete\nwith large utilities. We believe that our primary competitors are the established utilities that supply energy to homeowners by traditional means. We compete\nwith these utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price, and the ease by which homeowners can switch to electricity generated by our solar service\nofferings. If we cannot offer compelling value to customers based on these factors, then our business and revenue will not grow. Utilities generally have\nsubstantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do. As a result of their greater size, utilities may be able to devote more\nresources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market\nconditions than we can. Furthermore, these competitors are able to devote substantially more resources and funding to regulatory and lobbying efforts.\nUtilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher\nthan ours. In addition, a majority of utilities’ sources of electricity are non-solar, which may allow utilities to sell electricity more cheaply than we can. Moreover,\nregulated utilities are increasingly seeking approval to “rate-base” their own residential solar and battery businesses. Rate-basing means that utilities would\nreceive guaranteed rates of return for their solar and battery businesses. This is already commonplace for utility-scale solar projects and commercial solar\nprojects. While few utilities to date have received regulatory permission to rate-base residential solar or storage, our competitiveness would be significantly\nharmed should more utilities receive such permission because we do not receive guaranteed profits for our solar service offerings.\nWe face competition from other residential solar service providers, and we also may face competition from new entrants into the market as a result of the\npassage of the IRA and its impacts and benefits to the solar industry. Some of these competitors may have a higher degree of brand name recognition, differing\nbusiness and pricing strategies, lower barriers to entry into the solar market, and greater capital resources than we have, as well as extensive knowledge of our\ntarget markets. If we are unable to establish or maintain a consumer brand that resonates with customers, maintain high customer satisfaction, or compete with\nthe pricing offered by our competitors, our sales and market share position may be adversely affected, as our growth is primarily dependent on originating new\ncustomers. We also face competitive pressure from companies that may offer lower-priced consumer offerings than we do.\nIn addition, we compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission\nand distribution infrastructure. These energy service companies are able to offer customers electricity supply-only solutions that are competitive with our solar\nservice offerings on both price and usage of solar energy technology while avoiding the long-term agreements and physical installations that our current fund-\nfinanced business model requires. This may limit our ability to attract customers, particularly those who wish to avoid long-term contracts or have an aesthetic\nor other objection to putting solar panels on their roofs.\nFurthermore, we face competition from purely finance-driven nonintegrated competitors that subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from\ninstallation businesses (including solar partners) that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies and from electrical and roofing\ncompanies. In addition, local installers that might otherwise be viewed as potential solar partners may gain market share by being able to be the first providers\nin new local markets. Some of these competitors may provide energy at lower costs than we do. Finally, as declining prices for solar panels and related\nequipment has resulted in an increase in consumers purchasing instead of leasing solar energy systems, we face competition from companies that offer\nconsumer loans for these solar panel purchases.\n57\nAs the solar industry grows and evolves, we will continue to face existing competitors as well as new competitors who are not currently in the market\n(including those resulting from the consolidation of existing competitors) that achieve significant developments in alternative technologies or new products such\nas storage solutions, EV chargers, loan products, or other programs related to third-party ownership. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions, to\ncompete successfully with existing or new competitors and to adopt new or enhanced technologies could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on\nour business and prospects.\nA material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other sources would harm our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nA customer’s decision to buy solar energy from us often stems from a desire to lower electricity costs. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from\nutilities or other energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our business. The price of electricity from utilities could\ndecrease as a result of:\n• the construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or renewable energy technologies;\n• the construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n• a reduction in the price of natural gas or other natural resources;\n• energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption;\n• development of new energy technologies that provide less expensive energy, including storage; and\n• utility rate adjustments and customer class cost reallocation.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase of our solar service offerings less attractive. If the retail price of energy available from\nutilities were to decrease due to any of these or other reasons, we would be at a competitive disadvantage. As a result, we may be unable to attract new\ncustomers and our growth would be limited.\nThe production and installation of solar energy systems depends heavily on suitable meteorological and environmental conditions. If\nmeteorological or environmental conditions are unexpectedly unfavorable, the electricity production from our solar service offerings may be below\nour expectations, and our ability to timely deploy new systems may be adversely impacted.\nThe energy produced and revenue and cash flows generated by a solar energy system depend on suitable solar and weather conditions, both of which\nare beyond our control. Furthermore, components of our systems, such as panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather or natural catastrophes,\nsuch as hailstorms, tornadoes, fires, or earthquakes. In these circumstances, we generally would be obligated to bear the expense of repairing the damaged\nsolar energy systems that we own. Sustained unfavorable weather or environmental conditions also could unexpectedly delay the installation of our solar\nenergy systems, leading to increased expenses and decreased revenue and cash flows in the relevant periods. Extreme weather conditions, as well as the\nnatural catastrophes that could result from such conditions, can severely impact our operations by delaying the installation of our systems, lowering sales, and\ncausing a decrease in the output from our systems due to smoke or haze. Weather patterns could change, making it harder to predict the average annual\namount of sunlight striking each location where our solar energy systems are installed. This could make our solar service offerings less economical overall or\nmake individual systems less economical. Any of these events or conditions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change may have long-term impacts on our business, our industry, and the global economy.\nClimate change poses a systemic threat to the global economy and will continue to do so until our society transitions to renewable energy and\ndecarbonizes. While our core business model seeks to accelerate this transition to renewable energy, there are inherent climate-related risks to our business\noperations. Warming temperatures throughout the United States, and in California, our biggest market, in particular, have contributed to extreme weather,\nintense drought, and increased wildfire risks. These extreme weather events have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and our\ncustomers, and may cause us to incur additional operational\n58\ncosts. They can also cause a decrease in the output from our systems due to smoke or haze. Additionally, if weather patterns significantly shift due to climate\nchange, it may be harder to predict the average annual amount of sunlight striking each location where our solar energy systems are installed. This could make\nour solar service offerings less economical overall or make individual systems less economical.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather events associated with climate change have impacted our operations by delaying the installation of our systems,\nleading to increased expenses and decreased revenue and cash flows. For instance, the series of twelve atmospheric river weather events that deluged the\nwestern United States in 2023, resulted in prolonged, intense downpour of rain and high wind gusts, and put home roofs under acute stress. As a result, we\nhave seen a larger than usual number of damage claims in 2023, which have resulted in higher associated costs. Continued increases in similar types of\nextreme weather events may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur corporate mission is to connect people to the cleanest energy on earth, and we seek to mitigate these climate-related risks not only through our core\nbusiness model and sustainability initiatives, but also by working with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks.\nRisks Related to Our Operating Structure and Financing Activities\nWe need to raise capital to finance the continued growth of our operations and solar service business. If capital is not available to us on acceptable\nterms, as and when needed, our business and prospects would be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, our business is affected by\ngeneral economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Volatility in current economic conditions could\nadversely impact our business, including our ability to raise financing.\nOur future success depends on our ability to raise capital at acceptable terms from third parties to grow our business. To date, we have funded our\nbusiness principally through low-cost tax equity investment funds. If we are unable to establish new investment funds when needed, or upon desirable terms,\nthe growth of our solar service business would be impaired. Changes in tax law or changes in the interpretation of existing tax law could also affect our ability to\nestablish such tax equity investment funds, impact the terms of existing or future funds, or reduce the pool of capital available for us to grow our business.\nThe passage of the IRA, which extended subsidies for various renewable energy technologies, is expected to lead to additional demands for tax equity.\nAs a result, availability of tax equity may present constraints to our growth and harm our financial performance. In addition, terms for tax equity funds, including\nthe realization of tax credit value through potential structures that utilize transferability of the ITC, may not be at terms we view as favorable.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we transitioned a large portion of our funding from a traditional tax equity framework (where tax equity funding is\ntypically provided at or before installation) to a tax credit transfer framework under the IRA’s transferability provisions (where the timing of tax equity or cash\nequity funding can be dependent on the timing of the transfer of the tax credits, which occurs in arrears following the date the associated solar system is placed\nin service). Under this new transferability framework, any transfers of tax credits that occur in arrears can occur in a range from monthly up to a year or more\nfollowing the date the associated solar system is placed in service. As a result, the timing of tax equity and/or cash equity funding can be delayed, which may\nadversely impact our business and operations and may cause volatility to our cash flows as we have an increased mix of transferability funds.\nThe contract terms in certain of our existing investment fund documents contain various conditions with respect to our ability to draw on financing\ncommitments from the fund investors, including conditions that restrict our ability to draw on such commitments if an event occurs that could reasonably be\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on the fund or, in some instances, us. If we are not able to satisfy such conditions due to events related to our\nbusiness, a specific investment fund, developments in our industry, including tax or regulatory changes, or otherwise, and as a result, we are unable to draw on\nexisting funding commitments, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf any of the investors that currently invest in our investment funds decide not to invest in future investment funds to finance our solar service offerings due to\ngeneral market conditions, concerns about our business or prospects, decreased appetite for tax benefits or any other reason, or materially change the terms\nunder which they are willing to provide future financing, we would need to identify new investors to invest in our investment funds and our cost of capital may\nincrease.\n59\nIn addition, our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy. A general\nslowdown or volatility in current economic conditions, the level of U.S. national debt, currency fluctuations, unemployment rates, the availability and cost of\ncredit, the U.S. housing market, tariffs, trade wars, inflation levels, interest rates, energy costs, and concerns over a slowing economy or other factors, could\nadversely affect our business, including our ability to raise financing.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully access capital in a manner that supports the growth of our business. Certain\nsources of capital may not be available in the future, and competition for any available funding may increase. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain\nnecessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, unfavorable changes in the terms of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets. If\nwe are unable to continue to offer a competitive investment profile, we may lose access to these funds or they may only be available on less favorable terms\nthan those provided to our competitors or currently provided to us. If we are unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, our\nbusiness, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nVolatility and increases in interest rates raise our cost of capital and may adversely impact our business.\nWhile interest rates had been at long-term historic lows during large parts of our operating history, they increased in recent years, and may continue to\nincrease in the future. Rising interest rates, including the historic increases starting in 2021, have resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in our\nadvance rates, reducing the proceeds we receive from certain investment funds. Because our financing structure is sensitive to volatility in interest rates, higher\nrates increase our cost of capital and decrease the amount of capital available to us to finance the deployment of new solar energy systems. Additionally, we\nhave selectively increased pricing in many markets in prior years in response to higher interest rates, and may do so in the future, which may impact the overall\nattractiveness of our offerings to potential new customers. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital from fund investors and obtain secured\nlending to help finance the deployment of our solar service offerings. Part of our business strategy is to seek to reduce our cost of capital through such\nfinancing arrangements to improve our margins, offset reductions in government incentives and maintain the price competitiveness of our solar service\nofferings. Rising base interest rates or credit spreads, which have been, and may continue to be, worsened by inflation, an economic recession, or other\nvariables, may have an adverse impact on our ability to offer attractive pricing on our solar service offerings to customers, which could negatively impact sales\nof our solar energy offerings and our cash flows. Because we typically enter into interest rate swaps shortly after the installation of a system, we are subject to\nhigher interest rate risk between customer pricing through system installation, which may cause volatility to our cash flows.\nThe majority of our cash flows to date have been from solar service offerings under Customer Agreements that have been monetized under various\ninvestment fund structures. One of the components of this monetization is the present value of the payment streams from customers who enter into these\nCustomer Agreements. If the rate of return required by capital providers, including debt providers, rises as a result of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce the\npresent value of the customer payment stream and consequently reduce the total value derived from this monetization. Any measures that we could take to\nmitigate the impact of rising interest rates could ultimately have an adverse impact on the value proposition that we offer customers.\nWe expect to incur substantially more debt in the future, which could intensify the risks to our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. Some of our existing\ndebt arrangements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and we may be subject to similar restrictions under the\nterms of future debt arrangements. These restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. Increases in our existing debt obligations would\nfurther heighten the debt related risk discussed above.\nFurthermore, there is no assurance that we will be able to enter into new debt instruments on acceptable terms or at all. If we were unable to satisfy\nfinancial covenants and other terms under existing or new instruments, or obtain waivers or forbearance from our lenders, or if we were unable to obtain\nrefinancing or new financings for our working capital, equipment, and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed, our business would be adversely\naffected.\n60\nWe may be required to make payments or contribute assets to our investors upon the occurrence of certain events, including one-time reset or true-\nup payments or upon the exercise of a redemption option by one of our tax equity investors.\nOur investors in our tax equity investment funds typically advance capital to us based on, among other things, production capacity estimates. The\nmodels we use to calculate prepayments in connection with certain of our tax equity investment funds are updated at a fixed date occurring after placement in\nservice of all applicable solar energy systems or an agreed upon date (typically within the first year of the applicable term) to reflect certain specified conditions,\nas they exist at such date including the ultimate system size of the equipment that was sold or leased to the tax equity investment fund, the cost thereof, and\nthe date the equipment went into service. In some cases, these true-up models also incorporate any changes in law, which would include any reduction in rates\n(and thus any reduction in the benefits of depreciation). As a result of this true-up, applicable payments are resized, and we may be obligated to refund a\nportion of the tax equity investor’s prepayments or to contribute additional assets to the tax equity investment fund. In addition, certain of our tax equity fund\ninvestors have the right to require us to purchase their interests in the tax equity investment funds after a set period of time, generally at a price equal to the\ngreater of a set purchase price or fair market value of the interests at the time of the repurchase. Any significant refunds, capital contributions, or purchases that\nwe may be required to make could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.\nLoan financing developments could adversely impact our business.\nThe third-party ownership structure, which we bring to market through our solar service offerings, continues to be the predominant form of system\nownership in the residential solar market in many states. However, with the development of new loan financing products, we have seen a modest shift from\nleasing and power purchase arrangements to outright purchases of the solar energy system by the customer (i.e., a customer purchases the solar energy\nsystem outright instead of leasing the system or buying power from us). Continued increases in third-party loan financing products and outright purchases could\nresult in the demand for long-term Customer Agreements to decline, which would require us to shift our product focus to respond to the market trend and could\nhave an adverse effect on our business. The majority of our customers have historically chosen our solar service offerings as opposed to buying a solar energy\nsystem outright. Our financial model is impacted by the volume of customers who choose our solar service offerings, and an increase in the number of\ncustomers who choose to purchase solar energy systems (whether for cash or through third-party financing) may harm our business and financial results.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash to comply with certain covenants and satisfy payment obligations, and we may not have\nsufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our\nindebtedness, which may not be successful.\nWe have substantial amounts of debt, including our convertible senior notes (“Notes”), our credit facility and the non-recourse debt facilities entered into\nby our subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nand our consolidated financial statements, in each case, included in this periodic report. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay\ninterest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond\nour control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital\nexpenditures to operate our business. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling\nassets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to timely repay or otherwise refinance\nour indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage\nin these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and negatively impact our financial condition and prospects.\nIndebtedness under certain of our Senior and Subordinated Debt Facilities and our other credit facilities accrue interest at variable interest rates\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or other benchmark rates based thereof, collectively, “SOFR”).\nIn certain of our debt facilities accruing interest based on SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in\ncomparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. Additionally, some\nof our credit\n61\nfacilities based on SOFR include a credit spread adjustment on SOFR due to LIBOR representing an unsecured lending rate while SOFR represents a secured\nlending rate. In addition, ARRC has imposed certain curbs on interdealer trading in SOFR derivatives, which reduce market liquidity and may raise hedging\ncosts for us as end-users. The possible volatility of SOFR as the LIBOR replacement rate, the addition of credit spread adjustment in certain of our facilities,\nand potential illiquidity in SOFR derivative markets could result in higher borrowing costs for us, which would adversely affect our financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental\nchange, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nThe Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change under the\nindenture, which includes certain events such as a change of control, before the maturity date at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to\ndeliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to\nmake cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we\nare required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash for Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to\npay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness at the time.\nOur failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such Notes or to pay any cash payable on future\nconversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead\nto a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any\napplicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon\nconversions thereof.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nIn connection with our issuance of the convertible senior notes due 2026 in January 2021 and the convertible senior notes due 2030 in February 2024,\nwe entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The\noption counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such option\ncounterparties may default under the Capped Call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral.\nIf any option counterparty becomes subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, with respect to such option counterparty’s obligations under the\nrelevant Capped Call transaction, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under such\ntransaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be positively correlated to an increase in our common\nstock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by any of the option counterparties, we may suffer\nadverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any of the\noption counterparties.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Policy\nThe customer value proposition for distributed solar, storage, and home electrification products is influenced by a number of factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of electricity not consumed on site and exported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of\ncustomers’ utility bills, various policies related to the permitting and interconnection costs of our products to homes and the grid, the availability of\nincentives for solar, batteries, and other electrification products, and other policies which allow aggregations of our systems to provide the grid\nvalue. Significant changes to any of these factors may impact the competitiveness of our service offerings to customers.\nThe value proposition of our solar and storage offering, as well as our other related home electrification offerings, such as the electric vehicle charging\nstation, is impacted by several factors outside of our control including, but are not limited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of electricity not\nconsumed on site but exported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of customers’ utility bills, various policies related to the permitting and interconnection\ncosts of our products to homes and the grid, the availability of incentives for solar, batteries, and other electrification products, and other policies which allow\naggregations of our systems to provide the grid\n62\nvalue. For over two decades across the United States, utilities, their trade associations, fossil fuel interests, and some other stakeholders not aligned with a\ndecentralized grid have been challenging many legislative and regulatory policies that enhance the customer value proposition of residential solar and storage.\nIn connection with the value attributed to exported electricity, net metering (“NEM”) has traditionally been the main policy mechanism to measure and\nvalue exported electricity sent back to the grid in the markets within which we do business. That value has always varied depending on the retail price of power\nin a certain market, substantial differences in rate design per market, and NEM market specific differences, including detail around how to carry over NEM\ncredits, whether or not to cap the amount of net metered solar in a specific market, or how a specific market values the exported electricity. A substantial\nmajority of the markets in which we operate have implemented NEM policies, allowing end customers to receive credits for the electricity not consumed on site\nand exported to the grid.\nSome states, including our largest market of California, have moved away from the traditional retail NEM credit structure of paying the full retail rate for\nexported electricity, and instead, such states have chosen to value excess generation by customers’ solar systems in different ways. In 2016, the Arizona\nCorporation Commission (“ACC”) replaced retail NEM with a declining fixed export rate. In 2017, Nevada implemented a reduced credit step down to NEM\ncredits over time. Hawaii, a state with extremely high distributed solar penetration, effectively ended NEM in 2016 and has since become a solar plus battery\nmarket, with programs that utilize additional values from aggregated distributed resources, including rooftop solar paired with batteries, to support grid needs. At\nthe end of 2024, Illinois is set to transition from traditional retail NEM to a Smart Solar Billing tariff, which includes an upfront payment to value the benefits solar\nbrings to the distribution system paired with a time-varying export rate that can be responded to by utilizing solar paired with batteries. Many states across the\nUnited States have traditionally set limits on the amount of rooftop solar that can be exported for retail credit and there is a long legislative and regulatory\nhistory of those limitations being extended in various states, including California, New Jersey, Illinois, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\nOur ability to sell our solar service offerings may be adversely impacted by the failure to extend existing limits or “caps” to retail NEM or the elimination of\nother existing policies that value exported electricity to the grid. On April 26, 2022, Florida Governor DeSantis vetoed legislation that would have established a\nthreshold date and percentage trigger when retail NEM could have faced declines in the immediate export rate in Florida. New Jersey currently has no NEM\ncap but reached a threshold that triggers regulatory review of its NEM policy, which will proceed over the next two years. Recently, the Fiscal Oversight and\nManagement Board of Puerto Rico filed a lawsuit that would require the Puerto Rico Energy Board in 2025 to review and determine the future of NEM, which\ncould revise or reverse Puerto Rico’s Act 10, which had unanimously extended NEM through 2031.\nMost notably, as a result of the finalization of the NEM proceeding on December 15, 2022 by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”),\nCalifornia moved to a NBT structure in which exported electricity is no longer valued at the retail rate and is instead valued by the state’s “avoided cost” annual\ncalculations, which substantially decreases the credit allocated to an exported electron during the day. The final California NEM decision rejected a very\ncontroversial solar-specific fixed charge and rejected the creation of new non-bypassable charges, minimum bills, and grid participation charges for solar and\nsolar plus storage customers. Additionally, the final California NEM decision made no retroactive changes to legacy NEM 1.0 or 2.0 California customers. In\nApril 2023, new California solar customers located in areas serviced by investor-owned utilities (“IOU”) began applying for service under the new NBT. Also, in\nApril 2023, the California IOUs and other parties filed initial proposals that would represent the highest fixed charges in the United States. In a June 2023 ruling,\nthe CPUC indicated that it will approve by July 2024 guidelines for future development and implementation of income-graduated fixed charges, but the\nimplementation of the first iteration of these charges is not expected to occur until late 2026. In May 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision instituting a fixed\ncharge of $24.15/month for most customers of the three major investor-owned utility territories, with no change in existing income-tiers. The decision added a\nsmaller fixed monthly charge of $6/month and $12/month respectively for the two-tiers of existing low-income customers.\nThe final California NEM decision presents a significant change to the residential solar market in California. Under this new framework, storage paired\nwith solar has a heightened value proposition to customers, and we have seen an increased demand for our solar plus storage offerings, thereby increasing the\nimportance of procuring a variety of battery storage products and potentially accentuating supply chain risks related to battery storage systems. The new NBT\npricing framework may also result in the introduction of new product offerings and pricing structures by our competitors throughout the solar and utilities\nindustries, and has led to our introduction of Sunrun Shift™, our home solar subscription offering that maximizes the value of solar energy under California’s\nNBT by increasing self-consumption during peak hours when rates are highest and reducing low-value exports back to the grid through the use of a new\nstorage configuration. This may also result in increased competition and uncertainty regarding the demand for such new products and offerings, which may\nadversely impact our business and results of\n63\noperations. Recently, California Governor Newsom issued an executive order directing the CPUC and other state agencies to evaluate and report on efforts to\naddress rising electricity costs, and the potential impact of this executive order is still unclear.\nElectric utility statutes and regulations and changes to such statutes or regulations may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the\npurchase and use of our solar service offerings that may significantly reduce demand for such offerings.\nFederal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our solar service offerings and are\nconstantly evolving. These statutes, regulations, and administrative rulings relate to electricity pricing, net metering, consumer protection, incentives, taxation,\ncompetition with utilities and the interconnection of homeowner-owned and third party-owned solar energy systems to the electrical grid. These statutes and\nregulations are constantly evolving. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for\nresidential customers on a regular basis and these changes can have a negative impact on our ability to deliver savings, or energy bill management, to\ncustomers.\nIn addition, many utilities, their trade associations, and fossil fuel interests in the country, which have significantly greater economic, technical,\noperational, and political resources than the residential solar industry, are currently challenging solar-related policies, which may have the effect of reducing the\ncompetitiveness of residential solar energy. Any adverse changes in solar-related policies could have a negative impact on our business and prospects.\nRegulations and policies related to rate design could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar service offerings, reduce the value of the\nelectricity our systems produce, and reduce any savings that our customers could realize from our solar service offerings.\nAll states regulate investor-owned utility retail electricity pricing. In addition, there are numerous publicly owned utilities and electric cooperatives that\nestablish their own retail electricity pricing through some form of regulation or internal process. These regulations and policies could deter potential customers\nfrom purchasing our solar service offerings. For example, some utilities in states such as Arizona and Utah have sought and secured rate design changes that\nreduce the credit for residential solar exports to below the retail rate and impose new charges for rooftop solar customers. Utilities in additional states may\nfollow suit. Such rate changes can include changing rates to charge lower volume-based rates—the rates charged for kilowatt hours of electricity purchased by\na residential customer—while raising unavoidable fixed charges that an end customer is subject to when they purchase solar energy from third parties, and\nlevying charges on homeowners based on their point of maximum demand during a month (referred to as “demand charge”). For example, the Arizona Public\nService Company offers residential demand charge rate plans and if our solar customers have subscribed to those plans, they may not realize typical savings\nfrom our offerings. These forms of rate design could adversely impact our business by reducing the value of the electricity our solar energy systems produce\ncompared to retail net metering, and reducing any savings customers realize by purchasing our solar service offerings. These proposals could continue or be\nreplicated in other states. In addition to changes in general rates charged to all residential customers, utilities sometimes have proposed solar-specific charges\n(which may be fixed charges, capacity-based charges, or other rate charges). Any of these changes could materially reduce the demand for our offerings and\ncould limit the number of markets in which our offerings are competitive with electricity provided by the utilities.\nWe are not currently regulated as a utility under applicable laws, but we may be subject to regulation as a utility in the future or become subject to\nnew federal and state regulations for any additional solar service offerings we may introduce in the future.\nMost federal, state, and municipal laws do not currently regulate us as a utility. As a result, we are not subject to the various regulatory requirements\napplicable to U.S. utilities. However, federal, state, local or other applicable regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business\nand execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting our sale of electricity. These regulatory requirements could include restricting our sale of\nelectricity, as well as regulating the price of our solar service offerings. For example, the New York Public Service Commission and the Illinois Power Agency\nhave issued orders requiring registration of distributed energy providers in certain ways similar to energy service companies, which increases the regulatory\ncompliance burden for us in such states. If we become subject to the same regulatory authorities as utilities in other states or if new regulatory bodies are\nestablished to oversee our business, our operating costs could materially increase and we may not be able to execute on our business plans.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party-owned solar energy systems.\n64\nOur Customer Agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some states and\njurisdictions. These challenges pertain to issues such as whether third-party-owned systems qualify for the same rebates, tax exemptions or other non-tax\nincentives available for homeowner-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party-owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives, whether our\nCustomer Agreements are properly characterized as leases or PPAs, and whether third-party-owned systems are eligible for net metering and the associated\nsignificant cost savings. Texas and Connecticut clarified through legislation that third-party-owned residential solar systems would be treated the same as\ncustomer-owned systems, and would qualify for the existing residential solar property tax exemption. Additionally, Virginia passed legislation in the spring of\n2024 that clarified leased systems are allowed. Adverse regulatory treatment of third-party ownership arrangements could reduce demand for our solar service\nofferings, adversely impact our access to capital and cause us to increase the price we charge customers for energy.\nInterconnection limits or circuit-level caps imposed by regulators may significantly reduce our ability to sell electricity from our solar service\nofferings in certain markets or slow interconnections, harming our growth rate and customer satisfaction scores.\nInterconnection rules establish the circumstances in which rooftop solar will be connected to the electricity grid. Interconnection limits or circuit-level caps\nimposed by regulators may curb our growth in key markets. Utilities throughout the country have different rules and regulations regarding interconnection and\nsome utilities cap or limit the amount of solar energy that can be interconnected to the grid. Our systems do not provide power to customers until they are\ninterconnected to the grid, and some relevant laws and regulations in certain markets may considerably slow the timing of interconnection, which may in turn\nimpact the system production and our business and sales results.\nInterconnection regulations are based on claims from utilities regarding the amount of solar energy that can be connected to the grid without causing grid\nreliability issues or requiring significant grid upgrades. Although recent rulings from the Hawaii Utilities Commission have helped resolve some problems,\nhistorically, interconnection limits or circuit-level caps have slowed the pace of our installations in Hawaii. Similar interconnection limits could slow our future\ninstallations in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Colorado, New Jersey, or other markets, harming our growth rate and customer satisfaction scores. Similarly, the California,\nIllinois, and Hawaii Public Utilities Commissions require the activation of some advanced inverter functionality to head off presumed grid reliability issues, which\nmay require more oversight of the operation of the solar energy systems over time, but may also help ensure circuits remain open or interconnection costs\nremain low. Interconnection constraints and limits may hamper our ability to sell our offerings in certain markets and increase our costs, adversely affecting our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. We expect utility requirements to incorporate these advanced functions provided by the IEEE\n1547-2018/UL-1741 SB inverters and that they will become more commonplace. Additional states are expected to adopt the usage of advanced inverters to\nalign with California’s anticipated requirement that all new systems use inverters certified to the new UL 1741 SB standard. This requirement became effective\nin March 2023. All of our vendors are certified to this standard.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties, including our solar partners.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to develop or expand our relationships with third parties. For example, we are investing resources in\nestablishing strategic relationships with market players across a variety of industries, including large retailers, to generate new customers. These programs may\nnot roll out as quickly as planned or produce the results we anticipated. A significant portion of our business depends on attracting and retaining new and\nexisting solar partners. Negotiating relationships with our solar partners, investing in due diligence efforts with potential solar partners, training such third parties\nand contractors, and monitoring them for compliance with our standards require significant time and resources and may present greater risks and challenges\nthan expanding a direct sales or installation team. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to\ngrow our business and address our market opportunity could be impaired. Even if we are able to establish and maintain these relationships, we may not be able\nto execute on our goal of leveraging these relationships to meaningfully expand our business, brand recognition and customer base. This would limit our growth\npotential and our opportunities to generate significant additional revenue or cash flows.\nWe and our solar partners depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, batteries, and other system components to adequately meet\nanticipated demand for our solar service offerings. Any shortage,\n65\nbottlenecks, delay, detentions, or component price change from these suppliers, or the acquisition of any of these suppliers by a competitor, could\nresult in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of market share.\nWe and our solar partners purchase solar panels, inverters, batteries, and other system components from a limited number of suppliers, making us\nsusceptible to quality issues, shortages, bottlenecks, and price changes. If we or our solar partners fail to develop, maintain and expand our relationships with\nthese or other suppliers, we may be unable to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings, or we may only be able to offer our systems\nat higher costs or after delays. If one or more of the suppliers that we or our solar partners rely upon to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production,\nwe may be unable to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and we may be unable to satisfy\nthis demand.\nThe acquisition of a supplier by one of our competitors could also limit our access to such components and require significant redesigns of our solar\nenergy systems or installation procedures and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn particular, there is a limited number of suppliers of inverters, which are components that convert electricity generated by solar panels into electricity\nthat can be used to power the home. For example, once we design a system for use with a particular inverter, if that type of inverter is not readily available at an\nanticipated price, we may incur delays and additional expenses to redesign the system. Further, the inverters on our solar energy systems generally carry only\nten year warranties. If there is an inverter equipment shortage in a year when a substantial number of inverters on our systems need to be replaced, we may\nnot be able to replace the inverters to maintain proper system functioning or may be forced to do so at higher than anticipated prices, either of which would\nadversely impact our business.\nSimilarly, there is a limited number of suppliers of batteries. Once we design a system for use with a particular battery, if that type of battery is not readily\navailable from our supplier, we may incur delays and additional expenses to install the system or be forced to redesign the system. Cost and mass production\nof battery cells depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these\nmaterials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result\nof increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, global demand has increased for lithium-ion battery cells, which may cause\nchallenges for our battery suppliers, including delays or price volatility. Any such delays or reduced availability of battery cells (or other component materials)\nmay impact our sales and operating results. Further, these risks may increase as market demand for our solar and battery offering grows. Any reduced\navailability of these batteries may impact our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through\nincreased prices. Our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels, batteries and inverters, in times of rapid industry\ngrowth or regulatory change. Further, new or unexpected changes in rooftop fire codes or building codes may require new or different system components to\nsatisfy compliance with such newly effective codes or regulations, which may not be readily available for distribution to us or our suppliers. The manufacturing\ninfrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key\ncommodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to install\nsystems in a timely manner. Additionally, any decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currency of our component suppliers\ncould increase our component prices. Any of these shortages, delays or price changes could limit our growth, cause cancellations or adversely affect our\noperating margins, and result in loss of market share and damage to our brand.\nHuman rights issues in foreign countries and the U.S. government response to them could also disrupt our supply chain and operations. In particular, the\nWRO issued by the CBP on June 24, 2021 applicable to certain silica-based products manufactured in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, and\nany other allegations regarding forced labor in China and U.S. trade regulations to prohibit the importation of any goods derived from forced labor, could affect\nour operations. Further, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that President Biden signed into law on December 23, 2021, which took effect on June 21,\n2022, has affected, and may continue to affect, our supply chain and operations. Intensive examinations, withhold release orders, and related governmental\nprocedures have resulted in supply chain and operational delays throughout the industry, and we have implemented policies and procedures to maintain\ncompliance and minimize delays. These and other similar trade restrictions that\n66\nmay be imposed in the future could cause delivery and installation delays, and restrict the global supply of polysilicon and solar products. This, coupled with the\npassage of the IRA, could result in near-term demand for available solar energy systems despite higher costs, as well as increased costs of polysilicon and the\noverall cost of solar energy systems, potentially reducing overall demand for our products and services.\nIn addition, our supply chain and operations (or those of our partners) could be subject to events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, wildfires,\nflooding, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, droughts, tornadoes, the effects of climate change and related extreme weather, public health\nissues and pandemics, war, terrorism, government restrictions or limitations on trade, and geo-political unrest and uncertainties, such as Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine and the current armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip. We currently do not, and do not plan to in the future, source any products, materials,\ncomponents, parts, or services directly from providers in these regions. As a result, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our supply chain directly arising\nfrom these conflicts at this time.\nAs the primary entity that contracts with customers, we are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays, customer\ncancellations, regulatory compliance, and other contingencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe are a licensed contractor in certain communities that we service, and we are ultimately responsible as the contracting party for every solar energy\nsystem installation. We may be liable, either directly or through our solar partners, to customers for any damage we cause to them, their home, belongings, or\nproperty during the installation of our systems. For example, we, either directly or through our solar partners, frequently penetrate customers’ roofs during the\ninstallation process and may incur liability for the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations following the completion of construction. In addition,\nbecause the solar energy systems we or our solar partners deploy are high voltage energy systems, we may incur liability for any failure to comply with\nelectrical standards and manufacturer recommendations.\nFor example, on December 2, 2020, the California Contractors State License Board (the “CSLB”) filed an administrative proceeding against us and\ncertain of our officers related to an accident that occurred during an installation by one of our affiliate channel partners, Horizon Solar Power, which held its own\nlicense with the CSLB. On November 8, 2021, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement imposing citations and withdrawing the administrative proceeding\nwith additional conditions. We consistently denied wrongdoing concerning the allegations in the administrative proceeding and made no admissions of\nwrongdoing incident to the settlement. We could face other similar claims or proceedings in the future, which, if not resolved favorably, could potentially result in\nfines, public reprimand, probation, or the suspension or revocation of certain of our licenses.\nCompleting the sale and installation of a solar energy system requires many different steps including a site audit, completion of designs, permitting,\ninstallation, electrical sign-off and interconnection. Customers may cancel their Customer Agreement, subject to certain conditions, during this process until\ncommencement of installation, and we have experienced increased customer cancellations in certain geographic markets during certain periods in our\noperating history. We or our solar partners may face customer cancellations, delays or cost overruns which may adversely affect our or our solar partners’\nability to ramp up the volume of sales or installations in accordance with our plans. These cancellations, delays or overruns may be the result of a variety of\nfactors, such as labor shortages or other labor issues, defects in materials and workmanship, adverse weather conditions, transportation constraints,\nconstruction change orders, site changes or roof conditions, geographic factors, extended permitting and inspection times and other unforeseen difficulties or\nany other factors that may extend the timing to install, any of which could lead to increased cancellation rates, reputational harm and other adverse effects. For\nexample, some customer orders are canceled after a site visit if we determine that a customer needs to make repairs to or install a new roof, or that there is\nexcessive shading on their property. Additionally, as the demand for solar plus storage offerings grows, we anticipate facing additional operational challenges\nassociated with the complexity of deploying storage solutions that tend to have longer cycle times due to factors such as lengthened permitting and inspection\ntimes and potential need of a main panel upgrade. Any such factors that extend the timeframes from customer signature to installation or increased project\ncomplexity may result in increased operational challenges and correspondingly lower realization rates. If we continue to experience increased customer\ncancellations, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the current macroeconomic environment, including rising interest rates,\ninstability in financial markets and bank failures, may impact our ability to engage with new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. If\nour customers are materially negatively impacted by these factors, our business could be negatively impacted.\nPolicy can impact solar installation completion timelines. For example, in fall 2022, California passed SB 379, which imposes a required timeline for cities\nand counties to implement an online, automated solar permitting platform like SolarAPP+. Cities with populations over 50,000 and counties with populations\nover 150,000 were\n67\nrequired to have instant, online, automated residential solar and storage permitting as of September 30, 2023, which may increase the speed at which we install\nsolar systems. The remaining, smaller jurisdictions were required to implement instant, online residential solar and storage permitting by September 30, 2024.\nIn addition, the installation of solar energy systems and other energy-related products requiring building modifications are subject to oversight and\nregulation in accordance with national, state and local laws and ordinances relating to building, fire and electrical codes, safety, environmental protection, utility\ninterconnection and metering, and related matters. We also rely on certain of our and our partners’ employees to maintain professional licenses in many of the\njurisdictions in which we operate, and our failure to employ properly licensed personnel could adversely affect our licensing status in those jurisdictions. It is\ndifficult and costly to track the requirements of every individual authority having jurisdiction over our installations and to design solar energy systems to comply\nwith these varying standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems may result in significant additional expenses to us\nand our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar service offerings.\nWe have a variety of stringent quality standards that we apply in the selection, supervision, and oversight of our third-party suppliers and solar partners.\nWe exercise oversight over our partners through written agreements requiring compliance with the laws and requirements of all jurisdictions, including\nregarding safety and consumer protections, by oversight of compliance with these agreements, and enforced by termination of a partner relationship for failure\nto meet those obligations. However, because our suppliers and partners are third parties, ultimately, we cannot guarantee that they will follow our standards or\nethical business practices, such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental, safety and other local laws, despite our efforts to hold them\naccountable to our standards. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers or contractors, which could increase our costs and\nresult in delayed delivery or installation of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our\nsuppliers and solar partners or the divergence of a supplier’s or solar partner’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United\nStates or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business, brand and reputation in the market.\nIf we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer\nservice, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods and we intend to continue to expand our business within existing markets, such as Puerto\nRico, and in a number of new locations in the future, and with our product offerings, such as EV chargers. This growth has placed, and any future growth may\ncontinue to place, a significant strain on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. In particular, we have been in the past, and may in the future,\nbe required to expand, train and manage our growing employee base and solar partners. Our management will also be required to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with customers, suppliers, and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers, as well as to manage multiple geographic locations.\nIn addition, our current and planned operations, personnel, systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require\nus to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure, including additional costs for the expansion of our employee base and our solar partners as\nwell as marketing and branding costs. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes in a\ncost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business\nstrategies or respond to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulties in introducing\nnew solar service offerings or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition, and reputation.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and the cost of maintenance, repair and removal on solar energy systems that are owned or leased by our\ninvestment funds.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and are generally obligated to cover the cost of maintenance, repair and removal for any solar energy system that we\nsell or lease to our investment funds. At the time we sell or lease a solar energy system to an investment fund, we enter into a maintenance services agreement\nwhere we agree to operate and maintain the system for a fixed fee that is calculated to cover our future expected maintenance costs. If our solar energy\nsystems require an above-average amount of repairs or if the cost of repairing systems were higher than our estimate, we would need to perform such repairs\nwithout additional compensation. If our solar energy systems, more than 45% of which were located in California as of September 30, 2024, are damaged as\nthe result of a natural disaster beyond our control, losses could exceed or be excluded from, our insurance policy limits,\n68\nand we could incur unforeseen costs that could harm our business and financial condition. We may also incur significant costs for taking other actions in\npreparation for, or in reaction to, such events. We purchase property insurance with industry standard coverage and limits approved by an investor’s third-party\ninsurance advisors to hedge against such risk, but such coverage may not cover our losses.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nIf our solar service offerings, including our racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other products, injured someone, we would be\nexposed to product liability claims. Because solar energy systems and many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing devices, it is\npossible that customers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other\ncauses. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our solar partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability\nclaims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. Our solar energy systems, including our photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, and other\nproducts, may also be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects. Any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and divert\nmanagement’s attention. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could\nrequire us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales\nof our systems and other products. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential\nsolar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions to the industry as a whole, and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract customers, thus\naffecting our growth and financial performance.\nOur business is concentrated in certain markets, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, California represented over 45% of our customer base. This concentration of our customer base and operational\ninfrastructure could lead to our business and results of operations being particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other\nconditions in this market and in other markets that may become similarly concentrated, in particular the east coast, where we have seen significant growth\nrecently. Recent changes to net metering policy and the tariff structure in California in December 2022 have created additional uncertainty and challenges,\ngiven the size of our customer base in California. Originations in California continue to be below levels prior to the NBT transition, and without further increases\nin originations, our new installations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\noperations and financial performance.\nOur corporate and sales headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, an area that has a heightened risk of earthquakes and nearby wildfires.\nWe may not have adequate insurance, including business interruption insurance, to compensate us for losses that may occur from any such significant events.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire, or a public health crisis, such as a pandemic, or civil unrest could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism or malicious computer viruses could cause disruptions in our\nor our solar partners’ businesses or the economy as a whole. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of installations or the\ndeployment of our solar service offerings, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nChanges to the applicable laws and regulations governing direct-to-home sales and marketing may limit or restrict our ability to effectively compete.\nWe utilize a direct-to-home sales model as a primary sales channel and are vulnerable to changes in laws and regulations related to direct sales and\nmarketing that could impose additional limitations on unsolicited residential sales calls and may impose additional restrictions such as adjustments to our\nmarketing materials and direct-selling processes, and new training for personnel. If additional laws and regulations affecting direct sales and marketing are\npassed in the markets in which we operate, it would take time to train our sales professionals to comply with such laws, and we may be exposed to fines or\nother penalties for violations of such laws. If we fail to compete effectively through our direct-selling efforts, our financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects could be adversely affected.\n69\nExpanding and maintaining new sales channels and affiliate channel partner networks could be costly and time-consuming. As we enter new\nchannels and establish new partnerships, we could be at a disadvantage relative to other companies who have more history in these spaces.\nAs we continue to grow and expand our sales channels and affiliate channel partner networks, we may encounter challenges and additional costs.\nWith respect to developing our sales channels, such as direct-to-home, homebuilder, retail, and e-commerce channels and adapting to a remote selling\nmodel, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs. In addition, we may not initially or ever be successful in utilizing these new channels.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to compete successfully with companies with a historical presence in such channels, and we may not realize the anticipated\nbenefits of entering such channels, including efficiently increasing our customer base and ultimately reducing costs. Entering new channels also poses the risk\nof conflicts between sales channels. If we are unable to successfully compete in new channels, our operating results and growth prospects could be adversely\naffected.\nIf we fail to maintain or expand our affiliate channel partner relationships, we may be unable to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service\nofferings, or we may only be able to offer our systems at higher costs or after delays. Further, if the terms, including geographic scope, exclusivity, pricing,\nduration, or other key terms of our agreements with our solar partners are substantially altered, it may impact our operational results and financial performance.\nObtaining a sales contract with a potential customer does not guarantee that the potential customer will not decide to cancel or that we will not need\nto cancel due to a failed inspection, which could cause us to generate no revenue despite incurring costs and adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nEven after we secure a sales contract with a potential customer, we (either directly or through our solar partners) must perform an inspection to ensure\nthe home, including the rooftop, meets our standards and specifications. If the inspection finds repairs to the rooftop are required in order to satisfy our\nstandards and specifications to install the solar energy system, and a potential customer does not want to make such required repairs, we would lose that\nanticipated sale. In addition, per the terms of our Customer Agreements, a customer maintains the ability to cancel before commencement of installation,\nsubject to certain conditions. Any delay or cancellation of an anticipated sale could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have\nincurred sales-related, design-related, and other expenses and generated no revenue.\nThe value of our solar energy systems at the end of the associated term of the lease or PPA may be lower than projected, which may adversely\naffect our financial performance and valuation.\nWe depreciate the costs of our solar energy systems over their estimated useful life of 35 years. At the end of the initial typically 20- or 25-year term of\nthe Customer Agreement, customers may choose to purchase their solar energy systems, ask to remove the system at our cost or renew their Customer\nAgreements. Customers may choose to not renew or purchase for any reason, including pricing, decreased energy consumption, relocation of residence, or\nswitching to a competitor product.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to predict how future environmental regulations may affect the costs associated with the removal, disposal or recycling of our\nsolar energy systems. If the value in trade or renewal revenue is less than we expect, we may be required to recognize all or some of the remaining\nunamortized costs. This could materially impair our future results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of customers and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivables.\nOur Customer Agreements are typically for 20 or 25 years and require the customer to make monthly payments to us. Accordingly, we are subject to the\ncredit risk of customers. As of September 30, 2024, the average FICO score of our customers under a Customer Agreement with a monthly payment schedule\nremained at or above 740, which is generally categorized as a “Very Good” credit profile by the Fair Isaac Corporation. However, this may decline to the extent\nFICO score requirements under future investment funds are relaxed. While customer defaults have been immaterial to date, we expect that the risk of customer\ndefaults may increase as we grow our business. Due to the immaterial amount of customer defaults to date, our reserve for this exposure is minimal, and our\nfuture exposure may exceed the amount of such reserves. If we experience increased customer credit defaults, our revenue and our ability to raise new\ninvestment funds could be adversely affected. If economic conditions worsen, certain of our customers may face liquidity concerns and may be unable to satisfy\ntheir payment obligations to us on\n70\na timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and integration of these\nacquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe have in the past and may in the future, acquire companies, Project pipelines, Projects, SRECs, products, or technologies or enter into joint ventures\nor other strategic transactions. For example, we completed the acquisition of Vivint Solar on October 8, 2020. Also, in July 2020, we announced a venture with\nSK E&S Co., Ltd. and other affiliated companies focused on home electrification. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments,\nstrategic transactions, or acquisitions, and these transactions involve numerous risks that are not within our control. These risks include the following, among\nothers:\n• failure to satisfy the required conditions and otherwise complete a planned acquisition, joint venture or other strategic transaction on a timely basis or at\nall;\n• legal or regulatory proceedings, if any, relating to a planned acquisition, joint venture or other strategic transaction and the outcome of such legal\nproceedings;\n• difficulty in assimilating the operations, systems, and personnel of the acquired company, especially given our unique culture;\n• difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;\n• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration\nissues;\n• difficulty integrating the acquired company’s accounting, management information and other administrative systems;\n• inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n• inability to retain key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our results of operations;\n• significant post-acquisition investments which may lower the actual benefits realized through the acquisition;\n• potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal, and financial liabilities, among other things;\n• moderating and anticipating the impacts of inherent or emerging seasonality in acquired customer agreements;\n• potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and\n• potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions.\nOur failure to address these risks, or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future investments, strategic transactions, or\nacquisitions, could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm\nour business generally. Future\n71\nacquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, incremental\nexpenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could\ndecline.\nFrom time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of previously installed solar systems to further expand future solar and storage upsell and retrofit\nopportunities. While we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material portion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions\nopportunistically. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, and these transactions involve numerous risks that are not within our control.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, may not produce the anticipated benefits and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining our proprietary technology, including our BrightPath software, our ability to attract and retain\nsolar partners could be impaired, our competitive position could be harmed and our revenue could be reduced.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain our proprietary technology that supports our solar service offerings,\nincluding our design and proposal software, BrightPath. In addition, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on licensing agreements with certain third parties for\naerial images that allow us to efficiently and effectively analyze a customer’s rooftop for solar energy system specifications. In the event that our current or\nfuture products require features that we have not developed or licensed, or we lose the benefit of an existing license, we will be required to develop or obtain\nsuch technology through purchase, license or other arrangements. If the required technology is not available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we\nmay incur additional expenses in an effort to internally develop the required technology. In addition, our BrightPath software was developed, in part, with U.S.\nfederal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting\npatents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the\ngovernment to disclose certain confidential information related to BrightPath to third parties and to exercise “march-in” rights to use or allow third parties to use\nour patented technology. We are also subject to certain reporting and other obligations to the U.S. government in connection with funding for BrightPath. If we\nare unable to maintain our existing proprietary technology, our ability to attract and retain solar partners could be impaired, our competitive position could be\nharmed and our revenue could be reduced.\nDisruptions to our solar production metering solution could negatively impact our revenue and increase our expenses.\nOur ability to monitor solar energy production for various purposes depends on the operation of our metering solution. We could incur significant expense\nand disruption to our operations in connection with failures of our metering solution, including meter hardware failures and failure or obsolescence of the cellular\ntechnology that we use to communicate with those meters. For example, many of our meters operate on either the 3G or 4G cellular data networks, which are\nexpected to sunset before the term of our Customer Agreements, and newer technologies we use today may become obsolete before the end of the term of\nCustomer Agreements entered into now. Upgrading our metering solution may cause us to incur significant expense. Additionally, our meters communicate data\nthrough proprietary software, which we license from our metering partners. Should we be unable to continue to license, on agreeable terms, the software\nnecessary to communicate with our meters, it could cause a significant disruption in our business and operations.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and performance guarantee expenses, may lower the\nresidual value of our solar energy systems and may damage our market reputation and cause our financial results to decline.\nCustomers who enter into Customer Agreements with us are covered by production guarantees and roof penetration warranties. As the owners of the\nsolar energy systems, we or our investment funds receive a warranty from the inverter and solar panel manufacturers, and, for those solar energy systems that\nwe do not install directly, we receive workmanship and material warranties as well as roof penetration warranties from our solar partners. Furthermore, one or\nmore of our third-party manufacturers or solar partners could cease operations and no longer honor these warranties, leaving us to fulfill these potential\nobligations to customers, or such warranties may be limited in scope and amount, and may be inadequate to protect us. We also provide a performance\nguarantee with\n72\ncertain solar service offerings pursuant to which we compensate customers on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production\nguarantees set forth in their agreement with us. Customers who enter into Customer Agreements with us are covered by production guarantees equal to the\nlength of the term of these agreements, typically 20 or 25 years. We may suffer financial losses associated if significant performance guarantee payments are\ntriggered.\nBecause of our limited operating history and the length of the term of our Customer Agreements, we have been required to make assumptions and apply\njudgments regarding a number of factors, including our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the durability, performance and reliability of our solar energy\nsystems. Our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems, causing us to incur substantial expense to repair\nor replace defective solar energy systems in the future or to compensate customers for systems that do not meet their production guarantees. Product failures\nor operational deficiencies also would reduce our revenue from power purchase or lease agreements because they are dependent on system production. Any\nwidespread product failures or operating deficiencies may damage our market reputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nOur business may be harmed if we fail to properly protect our intellectual property, and we may also be required to defend against claims or\nindemnify others against claims that our intellectual property infringes on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends in part on our proprietary technology, including our software, information, processes and know-\nhow. We rely on copyright, trade secret and patent protections to secure our intellectual property rights. Although we may incur substantial costs in protecting\nour technology, we cannot be certain that we have adequately protected or will be able to adequately protect it, that our competitors will not be able to utilize our\nexisting technology or develop similar technology independently, that the claims allowed with respect to any patents held by us will be broad enough to protect\nour technology or that foreign intellectual property laws will adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our patents\nprovide us with a competitive advantage. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our\nconsent. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely\naffect our business. In the future, some of our products could be alleged to infringe existing patents or other intellectual property of third parties, and we cannot\nbe certain that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. In addition, any future litigation required to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or\nknow-how or to defend us or indemnify others against claimed infringement of the rights of third parties could harm our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe use “open source” software in our solutions, which may require that we release the source code of certain software subject to open source\nlicenses or introduce vulnerabilities into our software that could become exploitable and expose sensitive data, either of which could subject us to\npossible litigation or other actions that could adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize software that is licensed under so-called “open source,” “free” or other similar licenses. Open source software is made available to the general\npublic on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. We currently combine our proprietary software with open source software but not in a\nmanner that we believe requires the release of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. However, our use of open source software may entail\ngreater risks than use of third-party commercial software. Open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding\ninfringement claims or the quality of the code, which could introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited and lead to the loss of sensitive or protected data. In\naddition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to\nrelease the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime.\nWe may also face claims alleging noncompliance with open source license terms or infringement or misappropriation of proprietary software. These\nclaims could result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our\nsoftware, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if the license terms for open source software that we\nuse change, we may be forced to re-engineer our solutions, incur additional costs or discontinue the use of these solutions if re-engineering cannot be\naccomplished on a timely basis. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that\ncould impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to use our proprietary software. We cannot guarantee\n73\nthat we have incorporated or will incorporate open source software in our software in a manner that will not subject us to liability or in a manner that is\nconsistent with our current policies and procedures.\nAny security breach, unauthorized access or disclosure, or theft of data, including personal information, we, our third-party service providers, and\nsuppliers gather, store, transmit, and use, or other hacking, cyber-attack, phishing attack, and unauthorized intrusions into or through our systems\nor those of our third party service providers, could harm our reputation, subject us to claims, litigation, financial harm, and have an adverse impact\non our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we, our third-party providers upon which we rely, and our suppliers collect, receive, store, transmit, process, and use\nproprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including the personal information of customers, such as names, addresses, email addresses, credit information\nand other housing and energy use information, as well as the personal information of our employees. Unauthorized disclosure of such proprietary, confidential,\nor sensitive data, including personal information, whether through a breach of our or those of our third-party service providers and suppliers systems by an\nunauthorized party, including, but not limited to hackers, threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, nation-state-supported actors, personnel theft or misuse of\ninformation, or otherwise, could harm our business. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without\nlimitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major\nconflicts, we, the third parties upon which we rely, and our customers may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-\nattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services.\nIn addition, we, our third-party service providers upon which we rely, and our suppliers may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, such as computer\nmalware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), ransomware, malicious code (such as viruses or worms), social engineering (including\nthrough deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), telecommunications failures, denial-of-service attacks,\ncredential stuffing attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware\nfailures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, natural disasters and extreme weather events, general hacking, and other similar threats.\nCybersecurity threats have become more prevalent, and could impact our systems and those of our third parties in the future. Our team members who work\nremotely pose increased risks to our information technology systems and data, because many of them utilize network connections outside our premises that\nare less secure.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and\ninvestors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse\nconsequences. Inadvertent disclosure of confidential data, such as personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to this type of data\nin our possession, has resulted in, and could result in future claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by those affected, government enforcement\nactions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, indemnification obligations,\nreputational harm, interruptions in our operations, financial loss, and other similar harms. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the\nmultitude of federal, state and local laws, and applicable independent security control frameworks, regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal\ninformation.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be\neffective. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of such information, unauthorized intrusion, or other cyberthreat could harm our reputation,\nsubstantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers, interrupt our operations, and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts,\nincluding, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions. Our ability to monitor\nthese third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-\nparty service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages\nif our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we\nmay be unable to recover such award.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are\nsufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. While we currently maintain cybersecurity\ninsurance, such insurance may not\n74\nbe sufficient to cover us against claims, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or\nat all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nWe are, and may become, subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, contractual obligations, industry\nstandards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and\nuncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we process personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade\nsecrets, intellectual property, and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as\nvarious laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations\nrelating to data privacy and security. Obligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers’ data privacy expectations) are quickly changing,\nbecoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may\nbe inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources, which may\nnecessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices, and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our\nbehalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification\nlaws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws, and other similar laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”)\nimposes various consumer consent requirements and other restrictions on certain telemarketing activity and other communications with consumers by phone,\nfax, or text message, and violations of the TCPA violations can result in significant financial penalties, including penalties or criminal fines imposed by the\nFederal Communications Commission or fines of up to $1,500 per violation imposed through private litigation or by state authorities.\nIn the past few years, numerous U.S. states—including California, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, and Connecticut —have enacted comprehensive data\nprivacy and security laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording\nresidents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data,\nand to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may\nimpact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data,\nincluding sensitive information. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the CCPA applies to personal data of consumers,\nbusiness representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor\nrequests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and allows private litigants\naffected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. These developments further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk\nand compliance costs for us, the third parties upon whom we rely, and our customers.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we are or may become contractually subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups, such as the\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). Noncompliance by us or third parties on whom we rely with PCI-DSS can result in penalties\nranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses.\nWe publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials, or statements are\nfound to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions\nby regulators or other adverse consequences. We may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security\nobligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively\nimpact our business operations. If we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy\nand security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines,\npenalties, audits, inspections), litigation (including class-action claims), mass arbitration claims, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on\nprocessing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data.\nInformation technology systems are a critical component of our long-term competitive strategy, and if we fail to timely and responsibly implement,\nadopt, and innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological developments, including the use of artificial intelligence, our ability to compete,\nfinancial condition, and operating results could be adversely impacted.\n75\nOur ability to compete effectively requires our continued investment in technology to ensure we provide ongoing value to our current and potential\ncustomers and operate efficiently. However, there are many uncertainties in newly emerging technologies and if we are unable to integrate and introduce new\ntechnologies, products, and services effectively, our ability to compete may be adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed.\nWhether we compete effectively may also be impacted by our ability to accurately anticipate and effectively respond to the risks and opportunities\npresented by the disruptions and developments of emerging and newly available technologies, including artificial intelligence (“AI”). We may not be successful\nin anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and if the rate at which we adopt and the ways in which we apply new\ntechnologies lags or differs negatively in meaningful ways from our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn particular, generative AI and other new and emerging technologies present a number of inherent risks and incorporating them into our information\ntechnology infrastructure, products, and services responsibly is crucial to maintaining and strengthening our competitive position in the market. For example, AI\ntechnologies may create unintended biases, accuracy issues, and discriminatory outcomes that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product\ndevelopment or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, the\nunauthorized use of AI technologies by our employees, third-party providers, or our suppliers pose additional risks relating to data privacy and security,\nincluding the potential exposure of our confidential information to unauthorized recipients. Use of AI tools could result in future claims or litigation related to\nunauthorized access to or use of confidential information and failure to comply with open source software requirements.\nDamage to our brand and reputation or failure to expand our brand would harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend significantly on our brand and reputation for high-quality solar service offerings, engineering and customer service to attract customers and\ngrow our business. If we fail to continue to deliver our solar service offerings within the planned timelines, if our solar service offerings do not perform as\nanticipated or if we damage any customers’ properties or cancel Projects, our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired. We also depend greatly on\nreferrals from customers for our growth. Therefore, our inability to meet or exceed customers’ expectations would harm our reputation and growth through\nreferrals. We have at times focused particular attention on expeditiously growing our direct sales force and our solar partners, leading us in some instances to\nhire personnel or partner with third parties who we may later determine do not fit our company culture and standards. Given the sheer volume of interactions\nour direct sales force and our solar partners have with customers and potential customers, it is also unavoidable that some interactions will be perceived by\ncustomers and potential customers as less than satisfactory and result in complaints. If we cannot manage our hiring and training processes to limit potential\nissues and maintain appropriate customer service levels, our brand and reputation may be harmed and our ability to grow our business would suffer. In\naddition, if we were unable to achieve a similar level of brand recognition as our competitors, some of which may have a broader brand footprint, more\nresources and longer operational history, we could lose recognition in the marketplace among prospective customers, suppliers and partners, which could affect\nour growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy involves marketing and branding initiatives that will involve incurring significant expenses in advance\nof corresponding revenue. We cannot assure you that such marketing and branding expenses will result in the successful expansion of our brand recognition or\nincrease our revenue. We are also subject to marketing and advertising regulations in various jurisdictions, and overly restrictive conditions on our marketing\nand advertising activities may inhibit the sales of the affected products.\nA failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees and service providers in key functions would constrain our growth and our ability to\ntimely complete customers’ projects and successfully manage customer accounts.\nTo support our growth, we need to hire, train, deploy, manage and retain a substantial number of skilled employees, engineers, installers, electricians,\nsales and project finance specialists. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is increasing, particularly for skilled personnel involved in the installation\nof solar energy systems. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to attract or retain qualified and skilled installation personnel or installation\ncompanies to be our solar partners, which would have an adverse effect on our business. We and our solar partners also compete with the homebuilding and\nconstruction industries for skilled labor. As these industries grow and seek to hire additional workers, our cost of labor may increase. The unionization of the\nindustry’s labor force could also increase our labor costs. Shortages of skilled labor could significantly delay a\n76\nproject or otherwise increase our costs. Because our profit on a particular installation is based in part on assumptions as to the cost of such a project, cost\noverruns, delays or other execution issues may cause us to not achieve our expected margins or cover our costs for that project. In addition, because we are\nheadquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, we compete for a limited pool of technical and engineering resources that requires us to pay wages that are\ncompetitive with relatively high regional standards for employees in these fields. Further, we need to continue to expand upon the training of our customer\nservice team to provide high-end account management and service to customers before, during and following the point of installation of our solar energy\nsystems. Identifying, and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take several months before a\nnew customer service team member is fully trained and productive at the standards that we have established. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain\ntalented technical and customer service personnel, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or grow our business.\nIn addition, to support the growth and success of our direct-to-consumer channel, we need to recruit, retain and motivate a large number of sales\npersonnel on a continuing basis. We compete with many other companies for qualified sales personnel, and it could take many months before a new\nsalesperson is fully trained on our solar service offerings. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain qualified sales personnel or if they are unable to achieve\ndesired productivity levels, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIf we or our solar partners cannot meet our hiring, retention and efficiency goals, we may be unable to complete customers’ Projects on time or manage\ncustomer accounts in an acceptable manner or at all. Any significant failures in this regard would materially impair our growth, reputation, business and financial\nresults. If we are required to pay higher compensation than we anticipate, these greater expenses may also adversely impact our financial results and the\ngrowth of our business.\nRegulators may limit the type of electricians qualified to install and service our solar and battery systems in California, which may result in\nworkforce shortages, operational delays, and increased costs.\nIn June 2023, the CSLB initiated a formal rule proposal to allow solar installers (C-46 license holders) to continue to install energy storage systems less\nthan 80 kWh when “incidental and supplemental” to the installation of a PV system, but would require the use of a C-10 license holder for repair and retrofit\nwork. The proposed rule was adopted by the CSLB on April 18, 2024. The Office of Administrative Law approved the proposed rule on June 5, 2024, and the\nrule was set to be effective as of October 1, 2024. However, there is currently a preliminary injunction in the case and the CSLB is enjoined from taking any\naction to enforce or implement the regulation pending resolution of the case. The energy storage systems that we install in the residential market typically do\nnot exceed 80 kWh.\nWhile our workforce includes workers operating under both C-10 and C-46 licenses in California, there are a limited number of C-10 certified\nelectricians in the state and we are required to have each jobsite staffed with a Commercial Journeyperson or Residential Wireman (if it is a residential job) if\nany electrical work is being performed under a C-10, which may result in workforce shortages, operational delays, and increased costs. Obtaining a C-10\nlicense can be an extended process, and the timing and cost of having a large number of our C-46 licensed Solar Contractors seek such additional qualification\nis unclear. A significant portion of our customer base is in California, and as the state deals with growing wildfire risk and grid instability, an increasing number of\nour customers are choosing our solar and battery offerings. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain sufficient certified electricians, our growth of solar and\nbattery customers in California may be significantly constrained, which would negatively impact our operating results. We have actively managed our workforce\nin anticipation of these changing contractor regulations by signing up Electrical Trainees in all of our California branches and through on the job training plus\nenrollment in schooling we have had many of our trainees become Journeypersons as well.\nOur workforce has led the industry in safely installing solar and battery systems for tens of thousands of customers across the country, and we intend to\nwork with regulators, industry partners, and stakeholders to grow the solar and battery market throughout California.\nThe loss of one or more members of our senior management or key employees may adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy.\nWe depend on our experienced management team, and the loss of one or more key executives could have a negative impact on our business. With\nany change in leadership, there is a risk to organizational effectiveness and employee retention as well as the potential for disruption to our business. None of\nour key executives or our key employees are bound by employment agreements for any specific term, and we may be unable to replace key members of our\nmanagement team and key employees in the event we lose their services. Integrating new\n77\nemployees into our management team could prove disruptive to our operations, require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove\nunsuccessful. An inability to attract and retain sufficient managerial personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships could limit or delay our\nstrategic efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, regulatory inquiries and litigation, and we have previously been, and may in the future be, named in additional\nlegal proceedings, become involved in regulatory inquiries or be subject to litigation in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core\nbusiness and could result in an unfavorable outcome, or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or the\ntrading price for our securities.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from government and regulatory agencies from time to time. In the event that we are involved\nin significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that\ncould result in any number of outcomes. Although outcomes of such actions vary, any current or future claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us,\nwhether successful or not, could result in significant costs, costly damage awards or settlement amounts, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or\norders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nIf we are not successful in our legal proceedings and litigation, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages, which could hurt our results of\noperations. Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and divert management’s time and attention. Although we carry general liability insurance,\nour insurance may not cover potential claims or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict how the courts will\nrule in any potential lawsuit against us. Decisions in favor of parties that bring lawsuits against us could subject us to significant liability for damages, adversely\naffect our results of operations and harm our reputation.\nA failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective residential customers could result in negative\npublicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business involves transactions with customers. We and our solar partners must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations\nthat govern matters relating to our interactions with customers, including those pertaining to data privacy and security, consumer financial and credit\ntransactions, home improvement contracts, warranties and direct-to-home solicitation, along with certain rules and regulations specific to the marketing and\nsale of residential solar products and services. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal,\nstate and local legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes\nin these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we do business, acquire customers, and manage and use information we collect\nfrom and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to\nour interactions with residential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from\none jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Noncompliance with any such laws or regulations, or the perception that we or our\nsolar partners have violated such laws or regulations or engaged in deceptive practices that could result in a violation, could also expose us to claims,\nproceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may\nmaterially and adversely affect our business. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with such laws and regulations, and\nincreased regulation of matters relating to our interactions with residential customers could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional\nexpenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny investigations, actions, adoption or amendment of regulations relating to the marketing of our products to residential consumers could divert\nmanagement’s attention from our business, require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, and results of operations or could reduce the number of our potential customers.\n78\nWe cannot ensure that our sales professionals and other personnel will always comply with our standard practices and policies, as well as applicable\nlaws and regulations. In any of the numerous interactions between our sales professionals or other personnel and our customers or potential customers, our\nsales professionals or other personnel may, without our knowledge and despite our efforts to effectively train them and enforce compliance, engage in conduct\nthat is or may be prohibited under our standard practices and policies and applicable laws and regulations. Any such non-compliance, or the perception of non-\ncompliance, has exposed us to claims and could expose us to additional claims, proceedings, litigation, investigations, or enforcement actions by private parties\nor regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business and reputation. We\nhave incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and industry standards that apply to us.\nCompliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may\nresult in potentially significant penalties, operational delays and adverse publicity.\nThe installation of solar energy systems requires our employees and employees of our solar partners to work with complicated and potentially dangerous\nelectrical and utility systems. The evaluation and installation of our energy-related products also require these employees to work in locations that may contain\npotentially dangerous levels of asbestos, lead or mold or other substances. We also maintain large fleets of vehicles that these employees use in the course of\ntheir work. There is substantial risk of serious illness, injury, or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation\nunder OSHA and equivalent state laws. Changes to OSHA requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in\nincreased costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious illness, injury, or death occurs, we may be subject to civil\nor criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures, or suspend or limit operations. Any accidents,\ncitations, violations, illnesses, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and\ncompetitive position and adversely affect our business.\nIf our products do not work as well as planned or if we are unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on the products that we have developed or may develop in the future. There is a risk that the products\nthat we have developed or may develop may not work as intended, or that the marketing of the products may not be as successful as anticipated. The\ndevelopment of new products generally requires substantial investment and can require long development and testing periods before they are commercially\nviable. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and it is possible that we may not develop or acquire new products\nor product enhancements that compete effectively within our target markets or differentiate our products based on functionality, performance or cost and thus\nour new technologies and products may not result in meaningful revenue. In addition, any delays in developing and releasing new or enhanced products could\ncause us to lose revenue opportunities and potential customers. Any technical flaws in product releases could diminish the innovative impact of our products\nand have a negative effect on customer adoption and our reputation. If we fail to introduce new products that meet the demands of our customers or target\nmarkets or do not achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to penetrate new markets, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nWe have incurred losses and may be unable to sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur net losses as we increase our spending to finance the expansion of our operations,\nexpand our installation, engineering, administrative, sales and marketing staffs, increase spending on our brand awareness and other sales and marketing\ninitiatives, make significant investments to drive future growth in our business and implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth. We do\nnot know whether our revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these\nexpenses or their impact on our results of operations. Our ability to sustain profitability depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• growing our customer base;\n79\n• reducing our operating costs by lowering our customer acquisition costs and optimizing our design and installation processes and supply chain\nlogistics;\n• finding investors willing to invest in our investment funds on favorable terms;\n• maintaining or further lowering our cost of capital;\n• reducing the cost of components for our solar service offerings;\n• growing and maintaining our affiliate channel partner network;\n• maintaining high levels of product quality, performance, and customer satisfaction; and\n• growing our direct-to-consumer business to scale.\nEven if we do sustain profitability, we may be unable to achieve positive cash flows from operations in the future.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our\nresults of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future. We have experienced seasonal and quarterly\nfluctuations in the past and expect these fluctuations to continue. However, given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry, those fluctuations may be\nmasked by our recent growth rates and thus may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations. As such, our past quarterly results of\noperations may not be good indicators of future performance.\nIn addition to the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, as well as the factors discussed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” section, the following factors, among others, could cause our results of operations and key performance\nindicators to fluctuate:\n• the expiration, reduction or initiation of any governmental tax rebates, tax exemptions, or incentives;\n• significant fluctuations in customer demand for our solar service offerings or fluctuations in the geographic concentration of installations of solar energy\nsystems;\n• changes in financial markets, which could restrict our ability to access available and cost-effective financing sources;\n• seasonal, environmental or weather conditions that impact sales, energy production, and system installations;\n• the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital-raising\nactivities or commitments;\n• changes in our pricing policies or terms or those of our competitors, including utilities;\n• changes in regulatory policy related to solar energy generation;\n• the loss of one or more key partners or the failure of key partners to perform as anticipated;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate;\n80\n• general economic, industry and market conditions beyond our control, such as bank failures, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, other\nmacroeconomic factors, and associated economic downturn; and\n• changes to our cancellation rate.\nIn the past, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in sales and installations, particularly in the fourth quarter. This has been the result of decreased\nsales through the holiday season and weather-related installation delays. Our incentives revenue is also highly variable due to associated revenue recognition\nrules, as discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Seasonal and other factors\nmay also contribute to variability in our sales of solar energy systems and product sales. For these or other reasons, the results of any prior quarterly or annual\nperiods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. In addition, our actual revenue or key operating metrics in one or more future\nquarters may fall short of the expectations of investors and financial analysts. If that occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could\nlose part or all of your investment.\nOur actual financial results may differ materially from any guidance we may publish from time to time.\nWe have in the past provided, and may from time to time provide, guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management’s\nestimates as of the date such guidance is provided. Any such guidance is based upon a number of assumptions with respect to future business decisions\n(some of which may change) and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and\ncompetitive uncertainties and contingencies (many of which are beyond our control, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures,\ngeopolitical conflict, bank failures, other macroeconomic factors, and associated economic downturn). Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can\nbe expected that some or all of the assumptions that inform such guidance will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Our ability to meet\ndeployment volume, cost, net present value or any other forward-looking guidance is impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the number\nof our solar energy systems purchased outright versus the number of our solar energy systems that are subject to long-term Customer Agreements, changes in\ninstallation costs, the availability of additional financing on acceptable terms, changes in the retail prices of traditional utility generated electricity, the availability\nof rebates, tax credits and other incentives, changes in policies and regulations including net metering and interconnection limits or caps, the availability of solar\npanels and other raw materials, as well as the other risks to our business that are described in this section. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of\nwhat management believes is realizable as of the date such guidance is provided. Actual results may vary from such guidance and the variations may be\nmaterial. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light\nof the foregoing, investors should not place undue reliance on our financial guidance, and should carefully consider any guidance we may publish in context.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified board members and officers.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable rules and\nregulations, including, among other requirements, U.S. laws regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin and existence of certain “conflict\nminerals.” Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and\ncurrent reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. Maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with this standard requires\nsignificant resources and management oversight. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our\nbusiness and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more\nemployees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to Taxes and Accounting\nOur ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to finance these\nsystems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\nOur solar service offerings have been eligible for federal investment tax credits, U.S. Treasury grants, and other tax benefits. We have relied on, and will\ncontinue to rely on, tax equity investment funds, which are financing\n81\nstructures that monetize a substantial portion of those benefits, in order to finance our solar service offerings. If, for any reason, we are unable to continue to\nmonetize those benefits through these arrangements, we may be unable to provide and maintain our solar service offerings for customers on an economically\nviable basis.\nThe availability of this tax-advantaged financing depends upon many factors, including:\n• our ability to compete with other solar energy companies for the limited number of potential fund investors, each of which has limited funds and limited\nappetite for the tax benefits associated with these financings;\n• the state of financial and credit markets;\n• changes in the legal or tax risks associated with these financings; and\n• legislative or regulatory changes or decreases to these incentives, including forthcoming final regulations from the U.S. Treasury regarding the Section\n48 investment tax credit and the “tech-neutral” Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit.\nThe federal government currently offers a Commercial ITC under Section 48(a) of the Code, for the installation of certain energy properties, including\nsolar power and storage facilities owned for business purposes. The Commercial ITC was extended and expanded upon by the IRA, which was signed into law\nby President Biden on August 16, 2022. The IRA also created several ITC “bonus credits” to further incentivize various types of solar and storage facilities.\nOur inability to operationalize these tax credits, avail ourselves of IRA benefits in a timely fashion, or ensure the facilities we intend to qualify under the\nITC bonus credits satisfy the applicable requirements could impact our ability to compete, and compromise or eliminate opportunities to financially benefit from\nthese tax credits, which would adversely impact our business. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is in various stages of issuing guidance on the ITC bonus\ncredits.\nForthcoming further regulations and guidance on the ITC bonus credits and allocation process will be necessary to determine whether, to what extent,\nand when we may benefit from the bonus credits, and our ability to incorporate them into our business operations, which will be further impacted by when the\nU.S. Treasury promulgates additional guidance and the official regulations. The U.S. Treasury is expected to issue proposed and/or final rules on the Energy\nCommunities Bonus Credit, the Domestic Content Bonus Credit and the Clean Electricity Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program in late 2024 or early\n2025.\nThe federal government also currently offers a Residential Clean Energy Credit, for the installation of certain solar power facilities owned by residential\ntaxpayers, which is applicable to customers who purchase a solar energy system outright as opposed to entering into a Customer Agreement.\nWe and our tax equity partners have claimed and expect to continue to claim ITCs with respect to qualifying solar energy projects. However, the\napplication of law and guidance regarding ITC eligibility to the facts of particular solar energy projects is subject to a number of uncertainties, in particular with\nrespect to the new IRA provisions for which U.S. Treasury regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) will continue to be forthcoming, and there can be no assurance\nthat the IRS will agree with our approach in the event of an audit. The U.S. Treasury is expected to continue issuing Treasury Regulations and additional\nguidance with respect to the application of the newly enacted IRA provisions, and the IRS and U.S. Treasury may modify existing guidance, possibly with\nretroactive effect. For example, on November 17, 2023 the U.S. Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) titled “Definition of Energy\nProperty and Rules Applicable to the Energy Credit,” which will update the rules and regulations of the Section 48 ITC. Additionally, on January 1, 2025, the ITC\nframework of Section 48 that the solar industry has historically relied upon will shift to the “tech-neutral” Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit.\nThis transition may create uncertainty regarding the implementation of Section 48E and any potential U.S. Treasury guidance related to obtaining ITCs under\nthis new framework, which may cause delays or potentially adverse impacts on our business. Any of the foregoing items could reduce the amount of ITCs\navailable to us and our tax equity partners. In this event, we could be required to indemnify tax equity partners for disallowed ITCs, adjust the terms of future tax\nequity partnerships, or seek alternative sources of funding for solar energy projects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFuture reductions in the Commercial ITC and any further legislative reductions or changes to the Commercial ITC may impact the attractiveness of solar\nenergy to certain tax equity investors and could potentially\n82\nharm our business. Obtaining tax equity funding (and tax equity funding on advantageous terms) also may become more challenging. Additionally, the benefits\nof the Commercial ITC have historically enhanced our ability to provide competitive pricing for customers. Reductions in, eliminations of or expirations of\ngovernmental incentives such as the Residential Clean Energy Credit could reduce the number of customers who choose to purchase our solar energy\nsystems.\nAdditionally, potential investors must remain satisfied that the structures that we offer make the tax benefits associated with solar energy systems\navailable to these investors, which depends on the investors’ assessment of the tax law, the absence of any unfavorable interpretations of that law and the\ncontinued application of existing tax law and interpretations to our funding structures. Changes in existing law or interpretations of existing law by the IRS\nand/or the courts could reduce the willingness of investors to invest in funds associated with these solar energy systems. Moreover, reductions to the corporate\ntax rate may reduce the appetite for tax benefits overall, which could reduce the pool of available funds. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that this\ntype of financing will continue to be available to us. New investment fund structures or other financing mechanisms may become available, but if we are unable\nto take advantage of these fund structures and financing mechanisms, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. If, for any reason, we are unable to finance\nour solar service offerings through tax-advantaged structures or if we are unable to realize or monetize Commercial ITCs or other tax benefits, we may no\nlonger be able to provide our solar service offerings to new customers on an economically viable basis, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operations.\nIf the IRS makes determinations that the creditable basis of our solar energy systems is materially lower than what we have claimed, we may have to\npay significant amounts to our fund investors, and our business, financial condition, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe and our fund investors claim the Commercial ITC in amounts based on the purchase price paid by our funds for our solar energy systems (i.e., the\nfunds’ basis in the solar energy systems, or creditable basis). Such purchase prices are based on the fair market value of our systems as determined pursuant\nto independent appraisals obtained by us. With respect to Commercial ITCs, the IRS may on audit determine that the creditable basis for our solar energy\nsystems is lower than the amount determined by the appraisal and accordingly argue that the tax credits previously claimed must be reduced. If the creditable\nbasis is determined in these circumstances to be less than what we or our tax equity investment funds reported, we may owe our fund investors an amount\nequal to the amount by which the ITCs are reduced (including any interest and penalties), plus any costs and expenses associated with a challenge to that\nvaluation. We could also be subject to tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. If the IRS further disagrees now or in the future with the amounts we or our\ntax equity investment funds reported regarding the creditable or depreciable basis of our solar energy systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe have purchased insurance policies insuring us and related parties for additional taxes owed in respect of lost Commercial ITCs, depreciation, gross-\nup costs and expenses incurred in defending the types of claims described above. However, these policies only cover certain investment funds and have\nnegotiated exclusions from, and limitations to, coverage and therefore may not cover us for all such lost Commercial ITCs, taxes, costs and expenses.\nThe IRS is auditing one of our investors in an audit involving a review of the fair market value determination of our solar energy systems in the\ninvestment fund, which is covered by our 2018 insurance policy. If this audit results in an adverse final determination, we may be subject to an indemnity\nobligation to our investor, which may result in certain limited out-of-pocket costs and potential increased insurance premiums in the future.\nOur business currently depends on the availability of utility rebates, tax credits and other benefits, tax exemptions and exclusions, and other\nfinancial incentives on the federal, state, and/or local levels. We may be adversely affected by changes in, and application of, these laws or other\nincentives to us, and the expiration, elimination or reduction of these benefits could adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on government policies that promote and support solar energy and enhance the economic viability of owning solar energy\nsystems. U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, installers and manufacturers of solar energy systems to\npromote solar energy. These incentives include Commercial ITCs and Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit, as discussed above, as well as other tax\ncredits, rebates and SRECs associated with solar energy generation. Some markets, such as New Jersey and Maryland, currently utilize SRECs. SRECs can\nbe volatile and their value could decrease over time as the supply of SREC-producing solar energy systems installed in a particular market increases. We rely\non these\n83\nincentives to lower our cost of capital and to attract investors, all of which enable us to lower the price we charge customers for our solar service offerings.\nThese incentives have had a significant impact on the development of solar energy but they could change at any time, especially after changes in the\nAdministration or Congress. These incentives may also expire on a particular date, when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced, terminated or\nrepealed without notice. The financial value of certain incentives may also decrease over time.\nIn December 2017, significant federal tax legislation was enacted, including a change to the corporate tax rate (the “Tax Act”). As part of the Tax Act, the\ncurrent corporate income tax rate was reduced, and there were other changes including limiting or eliminating various other deductions, credits and tax\npreferences. This reduction in the corporate income tax rate may have reduced appetite for the Commercial ITC and depreciation benefits available with\nrespect to solar facilities. The IRA implemented a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% of financial statement income (subject to certain adjustments) for\ncompanies that report over $1 billion in profits to shareholders; similar to existing law, business credits (including Commercial ITCs) are limited to 75% of\nincome in excess of $25,000 (with no limit against the first $25,000). We cannot predict whether and to what extent the U.S. corporate income tax rate will\nchange as a result of the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Congress is constantly considering changes to the tax code. For example, on June 13,\n2023, the House Ways & Means Committee passed legislation (H.R. 3938) that, if it became law, would eliminate the IRA’s Section 48E Clean Electricity\nInvestment Credit, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2025. Further limitations on, or elimination of, the tax benefits that support the financing of\nsolar energy under current U.S. law could significantly impact our ability to raise tax equity investment funds or impact the terms thereof, including the amount\nof cash distributable to our investors. Similarly, any unfavorable interpretations of tax law by the IRS and/or the courts with respect to our financing structures\ncould reduce the willingness of investors to invest in our funds associated with any such structure.\nAny effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other\nlimitations on other types of energy generation that compete with solar energy projects could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business model also relies on multiple tax exemptions offered at the state and local levels. For example, some states have property tax exemptions\nthat exempt the value of solar energy systems in determining values for calculation of local and state real and personal property taxes. State and local tax\nexemptions can have sunset dates, triggers for loss of the exemption, and can be changed by state legislatures and other regulators, and if solar energy\nsystems were not exempt from such taxes, the property taxes payable by customers would be higher, which could offset any potential savings our solar service\nofferings could offer. Similarly, if state or local legislatures or tax administrators impose property taxes on third-party owners of solar energy systems, solar\ncompanies like us would be subject to higher costs.\nIn general, we rely on certain state and local tax exemptions that apply to the sale of equipment, sale of power, or both. These state and local tax\nexemptions can expire, can be changed by state legislatures, or their application to us can be challenged by regulators, tax administrators, or court rulings, and\nsuch changes could adversely impact our business and the profitability of our offerings in certain markets.\nWe may be subject to adverse California property tax consequences.\nThe State of California provides an exclusion (the “Solar Exclusion”) from the assessment of California property taxes for qualifying “active solar energy\nsystems” installed as fixtures before January 1, 2027, provided such systems are locally rather than centrally assessed (“Eligible Property”). However, the Solar\nExclusion is not a permanent exclusion from the assessment of property tax. Once a change in ownership of the Eligible Property occurs, the Eligible Property\nmay be subject to reassessment and California property taxes may become due.\nVivint Solar, through certain of its subsidiaries, owns solar energy systems that constitute Eligible Property (the “California PV Systems”). To the extent\nVivint Solar or its subsidiaries are considered the tax owners of the California PV Systems for purposes of the California Revenue and Tax Code, our acquisition\nof Vivint Solar may constitute a change of control of the California PV Systems, triggering the loss of the Solar Exclusion and the imposition of California\nproperty taxes, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports and, as a result, the value of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\n84\nWe are required, pursuant to the Exchange Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal controls\nover financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses, if any, identified by our management in our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We have\nexpended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and continuously look for ways to enhance existing effective\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, which presents additional complexities relating to the design and implementation of our\ndisclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we or our independent accounting firm may identify weaknesses and deficiencies\nthat we may not otherwise identify in a timely manner in the future. If we are not able to complete the work required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct on a timely basis for future fiscal years, our annual report on Form 10-K may be delayed or deficient. Because of the inherent limitations in all control\nsystems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances\nof fraud will be detected.\nWe cannot guarantee that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. The risk of errors is increased in light of\nthe complexity of our business and investment funds. For example, we must deal with significant complexity in accounting for our fund structures and the\nresulting allocation of net (loss) income between our stockholders and noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method as well as the income tax\nconsequences of these fund structures. As we enter into additional investment funds, which may have contractual provisions different from those of our existing\nfunds, the analysis as to whether we consolidate these funds, the calculation under the HLBV method, and the analysis of the tax impact could become\nincreasingly complicated. This additional complexity could require us to hire additional resources and increase the chance that we experience errors in the\nfuture.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and\ncompleteness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by\nNasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business.\nOur reported financial results may be affected, and comparability of our financial results with other companies in our industry may be impacted, by\nchanges in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to change and interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations\ncould have a significant effect on our reported financial results and on the financial results of other companies in our industry, and may even affect the reporting\nof transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Other companies in our industry may be affected differently by the adoption\nof new accounting standards, including timing of the adoption of new accounting standards, adversely affecting the comparability of financial statements.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $720.7 million and $3.3 billion,\nrespectively, which begin expiring in varying amounts in 2028 and 2024, respectively, if unused. Our U.S. federal and certain state NOLs generated in tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 total approximately $2.0 billion and $357.1 million, respectively, have indefinite carryover periods, and do not expire. Under\nSections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-\nchange tax assets, such as tax credits, to offset its post change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a\ncumulative change in our ownership by “5% stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under\nstate tax laws. Additionally, states may impose other limitations on the use of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. Any such limitations on our ability to use our\nNOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have performed an analysis to determine\nwhether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code had occurred and determined no ownership changes were identified as of December 31, 2023.\n85\nWe may be required to record an impairment expense on our goodwill.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Factors that can lead to impairment of goodwill include significant adverse changes in the\nbusiness climate and actual or projected operating results, declines in the financial condition of our business and sustained decrease in our stock price. During\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed an interim quantitative assessment as of September 30, 2023 related to the recoverability of our goodwill for our\none reporting unit as a result of a material sustained decline in our stock price. We concluded that the fair value of our one reporting unit did not exceed its\ncarrying value as of September 30, 2023 and recorded an impairment of $2.0 billion in our consolidated statements of operations. As of October 1, 2023, we\nconducted our annual goodwill impairment test. The test concluded that no additional impairment had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. Since our\nannual impairment test of goodwill for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we have not identified any indicators of goodwill impairment that would require\nan interim goodwill impairment test.\nIt is possible that we could recognize further goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n• there are further sustained declines in our stock price;\n• valuations for comparable companies or comparable acquisitions valuations deteriorate\nthe cost of equity or debt capital increases; or\n• the outlook for future cash flows for our reporting unit deteriorates due to but not limited to, increased competition, changes to discount rate, downward\nforecast revisions, restricted plans or changes in state and federal regulations affecting our business.\nFor further information regarding the assessment please see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders continue to have substantial control over us, which will limit your ability to influence the\noutcome of important matters, including a change in control.\nOur executive officers, directors and each of our stockholders who beneficially own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in\nthe aggregate, beneficially own approximately 47.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders,\nincluding the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock and might ultimately\naffect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common\nstock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering, and is likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that could cause\nfluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n• volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n• sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n86\n• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations;\n• changes in tax and other incentives that we rely upon in order to raise tax equity investment funds;\n• actual or perceived data privacy or security incidents;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights;\n• changes in the regulatory environment and utility policies and pricing, including those that could reduce any savings we are able to offer to customers;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n• litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n• major catastrophic events, global armed conflicts or civil unrest;\n• negative publicity, including accurate or inaccurate commentary or reports regarding us, our products, our sales professionals or other personnel, or\nother third parties affiliated with us, on social media platforms, blogs, and other websites;\n• any significant change in our management; and\n• general economic conditions including instability in financial markets and bank failures, and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nFurther, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity\nsecurities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In addition,\nthe stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those\ncompanies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, government\nshutdowns, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, has, and may continue to, cause the trading price of the Notes and our common stock\nto decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. We are party to litigation that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s\nattention and resources.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including by our existing stockholders, could cause our stock\nprice to fall.\n87\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the\nmarket price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect\nthat these sales and others may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders, including SK E&S Co., Ltd. and other affiliated companies as well as certain stockholders who received shares\nas a result of our acquisition of Vivint Solar, have registration rights that would require us to register shares of our capital stock owned by them for public sale in\nthe United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity\ncompensation plans, including shares underlying equity awards assumed in connection with our acquisition of Vivint Solar. Subject to the satisfaction of\napplicable exercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding\noptions will become available for immediate resale in the public market upon issuance.\nFuture sales of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem\nappropriate. These sales also could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common\nstock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware\nlaw, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering\nmore difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAmong other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n• authorizing “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting,\nliquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n• limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n• limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n• requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for\nelection to our board of directors; and\n• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which\nprevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the\nholders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock not held by such stockholder. Any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended\nand restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive\na premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws limit the ability of our stockholders to call special\nmeetings and prohibit stockholder action by written consent.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent. Instead, any such actions must be taken\nat an annual or special meeting of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders are not able to take any action without first holding a meeting of our\nstockholders called in accordance with the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, including advance notice procedures set forth in our amended and\nrestated bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that special meetings of our\n88\nstockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our President. As a\nresult, our stockholders are not allowed to call a special meeting. These provisions may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a\nstockholder proposal, including a proposal to remove directors.\nProvisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could preclude our stockholders from bringing\nmatters before meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before, or nominate candidates for\nelection as directors at, our annual or special meetings of stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may\nremove directors only for cause. Any amendment of these provisions in our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation would require\napproval by holders of a majority of our then outstanding capital stock. These provisions could preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before annual or\nspecial meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for\nsubstantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for\ndisputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other\nemployees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) any\naction asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware, in all cases subject to the\ncourt’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties names as defendants. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring\na claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against\nus and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an\nalternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the\nresolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our\namended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors, or if they adversely\nchange their recommendations regarding our common stock, the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our\nmarket or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or provide more\nfavorable recommendations about our competitors, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If any of the analysts who cover us cease\ncoverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of\nour common stock and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future, so investors may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price\nappreciation, which may never occur or only occur at certain times, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit agreements contain\nrestrictions on payments of cash dividends. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never\noccur or only occur at certain times, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase\nshares of our common stock.\n89\nAdditional issuances of our capital stock or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, make acquisitions or for a variety of other purposes. For example, in connection with the\nacquisition of Vivint Solar, we issued 0.55 shares of our common stock for each share of Vivint Solar’s common stock owned prior to the acquisition, which\nresulted in dilution to our stockholders. Additional issuances of our capital stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or conversion of new or existing\nconvertible debt securities (including the Notes), warrants, stock options or other equity incentive awards to new and existing service providers. Any such\nissuances will result in dilution to existing holders of our stock. We also rely on equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining\nemployees. The amount of dilution due to equity-based compensation of our employees and other additional issuances of our common stock or securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could be substantial, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe Capped Call transactions may negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Call transactions with the option counterparties. The Capped Call transactions\nare expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to\nmake in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our\ncommon stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes\n(and are likely to do so during the observation period for conversions of Notes following November 1, 2025 for the 2026 Notes or December 1, 2029 for the\n2030 Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common\nstock.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot\nbe ascertained at this time.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring our last fiscal quarter, some of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated the\ncontracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of our securities as noted below.\nOn August 16, 2024, Paul Dickson, our President and Chief Revenue Officer, terminated a trading plan for the sale of the Company’s common stock\nthat is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c). The trading plan was set to expire on August 15, 2025 and provided for the following\ntransactions, each of which was based upon the Company’s stock price reaching certain price thresholds: (i) the exercise of up to 140,250 stock options and\nthe sale of the underlying shares of common stock, and (ii) the sale of up to 63,266 shares of common stock. Subsequently on August 26, 2024, Mr. Dickson\nadopted a trading plan for the sale of the Company’s common stock that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c). The trading plan is set\nto expire on November 28, 2025 and provides for the following transactions, each of which is subject to the Company's stock price reaching certain price\nthresholds: (i) the exercise of up to 222,852 stock options and the sale of the underlying shares of common stock, and (ii) the sale of up to 159,233 shares of\ncommon stock.\nItem 6.

Form 10-K Summary 130\ni\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nwhich statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future\nevents or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements\nbecause they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “goals,” “anticipates,” “could,”\n“intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,” or the\nnegative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or\nintentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to,\nstatements about:\n• the potential impact of regulatory and policy development and changes;\n• the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, and decreases to federal solar tax credits;\n• the potential impact of volatile or rising interest rates on our interest expense;\n• our industry’s, and specifically our, continued ability to manage costs (including, but not limited to, equipment\ncosts) associated with solar service offerings;\n• potential changes in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other energy sources;\n• the sufficiency of our cash, investment fund commitments and available borrowings to meet our anticipated\ncash needs;\n• our need and ability to raise capital, refinance existing debt, and finance our operations and solar energy\nsystems from new and existing investors;\n• our investment in research and development and new product offerings;\n• determinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of the creditable basis of our solar energy systems;\n• our ability to manage our supply chains and distribution channels and the impact of natural disasters,\ngeopolitical conflicts, any lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond our control;\n• our business plan and our ability to effectively manage our growth, including our rate of revenue growth;\n• our ability to further penetrate existing markets, expand into new markets and our expectations regarding\nmarket growth (including, but not limited to, expected cancellation rates);\n• our expectations concerning relationships with third parties, including the attraction, retention and continued\nexistence of qualified solar partners;\n• the impact of seasonality on our business;\n• our strategic partnerships and investments and the expected benefits of such partnerships and investments;\n1\n• supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations, bank failures, geopolitical\nconflicts and other macroeconomic conditions on our business and operations, results of operations and\nfinancial position;\n• our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or\nacquisitions, and risk that the integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property and customer data, as well as to maintain our brand;\n• the willingness of and ability of our solar partners to fulfill their respective warranty and other contractual\nobligations;\n• our ability to renew or replace expiring, canceled or terminated Customer Agreements at favorable rates or on\na long-term basis;\n• the ability of our solar energy systems to operate or deliver energy for any reason, including if interconnection\nor transmission facilities on which we rely become unavailable;\n• our expectations regarding certain performance objectives and the renewal rates and purchase value of our\nsolar energy systems after expiration of our Customer Agreements;\n• the calculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics and accounting policies; and\n• our ability to capitalize on the market opportunities created by the electrification of the U.S. economy with\nrenewable energy.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including\nthose described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover,\nwe operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is\nnot possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or\nthe extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in any forward-looking statements we may make. These risks and uncertainties may be amplified by\nevolving economic and regulatory conditions, including increasing or volatile interest rates. The extent to which\nthese risks and uncertainties impact our business, operations, and financial results, including the duration and\nmagnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, rapidity, and\nintensity of these conditions, how widespread their impact is and will continue to be on our industry, and how quickly\nand to what extent more predictable and stable economic conditions resume. In light of these risks, uncertainties\nand assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may\nnot occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-\nlooking statements.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that\nthe expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future\nresults, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will\nbe achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking\nstatements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform these statements to actual\nresults or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law.\nYou should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as exhibits to this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and\nevents and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.\n2\nSELECTED RISKS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS\nInvesting in our common stock involves numerous risks, including the risks described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk\nFactors”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Below are some of these risks, any one of which could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSelected Risks Related to the Solar Industry\n• The solar energy industry is an emerging market which is constantly evolving and may not develop to the\nsize or at the rate we expect.\n• We have historically benefited from declining costs in our industry, and our business and financial results\nmay be harmed as a result of recent and any continued increases in costs associated with our solar service\nofferings and any failure of these costs to continue declining as we currently expect. If we do not reduce our\ncost structure in the future, our ability to continue to be profitable may be impaired.\n• We face competition from traditional energy companies as well as solar and other renewable energy\ncompanies.\nSelected Risks Related to Our Operating Structure and Financing Activities\n• We need to raise capital to finance the continued growth of our operations and solar service business. If\ncapital is not available to us on acceptable terms, as and when needed, our business and prospects would\nbe materially and adversely impacted. In addition, our business is affected by general economic conditions\nand related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Volatility in current economic conditions\ncould adversely impact our business, including our ability to raise financing.\n• Volatility and increases in interest rates raise our cost of capital and may adversely impact our business.\n• We expect to incur substantially more debt in the future, which could intensify the risks to our business.\nSelected Risks Related to Regulation and Policy\n• The customer value proposition for distributed solar, storage, and home electrification products is influenced\nby a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of electricity\nnot consumed on site and exported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of customers’ utility bills,\nvarious policies related to the permitting and interconnection costs of our products to homes and the grid,\nthe availability of incentives for solar, batteries, and other electrification products, and other policies which\nallow aggregations of our systems to provide the grid value. Significant changes to any of these factors may\nimpact the competitiveness of our service offerings to customers.\n• Electric utility statutes and regulations and changes to such statutes or regulations may present technical,\nregulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of our solar service offerings that may\nsignificantly reduce demand for such offerings.\n• Regulations and policies related to rate design could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar\nservice offerings, reduce the value of the electricity our systems produce, and reduce any savings that our\ncustomers could realize from our solar service offerings.\nSelected Risks Related to Our Business Operations\n• Our growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties, including our solar\npartners.\n• We and our solar partners depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, batteries, and other\nsystem components to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings. Any shortage,\nbottlenecks, delay, detentions, or component price change from these suppliers, or the acquisition of any of\nthese suppliers by a competitor, could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations and loss of\nmarket share.\n3\n• If we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business\nplan, maintain high levels of customer service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\n• We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or\nacquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and our management.\n• A failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees and service providers in key functions would\nconstrain our growth and our ability to timely complete customers' Projects and successfully manage\ncustomer accounts.\n• Regulators may impose rules on the type of electricians qualified to install and service our solar and battery\nsystems in California, which may result in workforce shortages, operational delays, and increased costs.\n• Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance\ndifficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations,\nresulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\n• Our actual financial results may differ materially from any guidance we may publish from time to time.\n• Failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, contracts, self-regulatory\nschemes, standards, and other obligations related to data privacy and security (including security incidents)\ncould harm our business. Compliance or the actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations\ncould increase the costs of our products/services, limit their use or adoption, and otherwise negatively affect\nour operating results and business.\nSelected Risks Related to Taxes and Accounting\n• Our ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in\npart on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\n• If the IRS makes determinations that the creditable basis of our solar energy systems is materially lower\nthan what we have claimed, we may have to pay significant amounts to our fund investors, and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n• Our business currently depends on the availability of utility rebates, tax credits and other benefits, tax\nexemptions and exclusions, and other financial incentives, on the federal, state, and/or local levels. We may\nbe adversely affected by changes in, and application of, these laws or other incentives to us, and the\nexpiration, elimination or reduction of these benefits could adversely impact our business.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business may be harmed.\n4\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nOverview\nSunrun's (the “Company,” “our,” “we”) mission is to connect people to the cleanest energy on earth. Sunrun\ntransformed the solar industry in 2007 by removing financial barriers and democratizing access to locally-generated,\nrenewable energy. Today, Sunrun is the nation’s leading provider of clean energy as a subscription service, offering\nresidential solar and storage with no upfront costs. Sunrun’s innovative products and solutions can connect homes\nto the cleanest energy on earth, providing them with energy security, predictability, and peace of mind. Sunrun also\nmanages energy services that benefit communities, utilities, and the electric grid while enhancing customer value.\nWe are engaged in the design, development, installation, sale, ownership and maintenance of residential\nsolar energy systems (“Projects”) in the United States. We provide clean, solar energy typically at savings\ncompared to traditional utility energy. Our primary customers are residential homeowners. We also offer battery\nstorage along with solar energy systems to our customers in select markets and sell our services to certain\ncommercial developers through our multi-family and new homes offerings. After inventing the residential solar\nservice model and recognizing its enormous market potential, we have built the infrastructure and capabilities\nnecessary to rapidly acquire and serve customers in a low-cost and scalable manner. Today, our scalable operating\nplatform provides us with a number of unique advantages. First, we are able to drive distribution by marketing our\nsolar service offerings through multiple channels, including our diverse partner network and direct-to-consumer\noperations. This multi-channel model supports broad sales and installation capabilities, which together allow us to\nachieve capital-efficient growth. Second, we are able to provide differentiated solutions to our customers that,\ncombined with a great customer experience, we believe will drive meaningful margin advantages for us over the\nlong term as we strive to create the industry’s most valuable and satisfied customer base.\nOur core solar service offerings are provided through our lease and power purchase agreements, which we\nrefer to as our “Customer Agreements,” and which provide customers with simple, predictable pricing for solar\nenergy that is insulated from rising retail electricity prices. They also provide customers who opt for storage offerings\nthe benefit of increased resiliency from backup energy and enhanced energy management capabilities. While\ncustomers have the option to purchase a solar energy system outright from us, most of our customers choose to\nbuy solar as a service from us through our Customer Agreements without the significant upfront investment of\npurchasing a solar energy system. With our solar service offerings, we install solar energy systems on our\ncustomers’ homes and provide them with the solar power produced by those systems for typically a 20- or 25-year\ninitial term. In addition, we monitor, maintain and insure the system during the term of the contract. In exchange, we\nreceive predictable cash flows from high credit quality customers and qualify for tax and other benefits. We finance\nportions of these tax benefits and cash flows through tax equity, non-recourse debt and project equity structures in\norder to fund our upfront costs, overhead and growth investments. We develop valuable customer relationships that\ncan extend beyond this initial contract term and provide us an opportunity over time to integrate additional solar,\nbattery storage, electrification and distributed power plant offerings into a smart solution for each home and\ncommunity. Since our founding, we have continued to invest in a platform of services and tools to enable large scale\noperations for us and our partner network, and these partners include solar integrators, sales partners, installation\npartners and other strategic partners. The platform includes processes and software, as well as fulfillment and\nacquisition of marketing leads. We believe our platform empowers new market entrants and smaller industry\nparticipants to profitably serve our large and underpenetrated market without making the significant investments in\ntechnology and infrastructure required to compete effectively against established industry players. Our platform\nprovides the support for our multi-channel model, which drives broad customer reach and capital-efficient growth.\nDelivering a differentiated customer experience is core to our strategy. We emphasize a customized solution,\nincluding a design specific to each customer’s home and pricing configurations that typically drive both customer\nsavings and value to us. We believe that our passion for engaging our customers, developing a trusted brand, and\nproviding a customized solar service offering resonates with our customers who are accustomed to a traditional\nresidential power market that is often overpriced and lacking in customer choice.\n5\nWe have experienced substantial growth in our business and operations since our inception in 2007, as well\nas through our acquisition of Vivint Solar on October 8, 2020. As of December 31, 2023, we operated the largest\nfleet of residential solar energy systems in the United States. We have a Networked Solar Energy Capacity of 6,689\nmegawatts as of December 31, 2023, which represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar\nenergy systems that have been recognized as deployments, from our inception through the measurement date. Our\nGross Earning Assets as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $14.2 billion. Please see the section entitled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Operating\nMetrics” for more details on how we calculate Networked Solar Energy Capacity and Gross Earning Assets.\nWe also have a long track record of attracting low-cost capital from diverse sources, including tax equity and\ndebt investors. Since inception we have raised tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy\nsystems.\nOur Multi-Channel Capabilities\nOur unique, multi-channel capabilities offer consumers a compelling solar service through scalable, cost-\neffective and consumer-friendly channels. Customers can access our products through three channels: direct-to-\nconsumer, solar partnerships and strategic partnerships.\nDirect-to-Consumer\nWe sell solar service offerings and install solar energy systems for customers through our direct-to-consumer\nchannel. These solar energy systems are offered to customers either under a Customer Agreement or for purchase.\nThis channel consists of an online lead generation function, a telesales and field sales team, a direct-to-home sales\nforce, a retail sales team and an industry-leading installation organization.\nSolar Partnerships\nWe contract with diverse solar organizations that act as either exclusive or non-exclusive (depending on the\nterms of their contract with us) distributors of our solar service offerings and subcontractors for the installation of the\nrelated solar energy systems. Because of our commitment to these solar organizations and our vested interest in\ntheir success, we refer to them as our “solar partners,” although the actual legal relationship is that of an\nindependent contractor. Our solar partners include:\n• Solar integrators: trained and trusted partners who originate customers for our solar service offerings\nand procure and install the solar energy systems on our customers’ homes on our behalf as our\nsubcontractors. Partnerships with solar integrators allow us to expand our brand, quickly enter new\nmarkets and drive capital-efficient growth. We compensate our solar integrators on a per solar energy\nsystem basis for generating Customer Agreements and the installation work they perform for us.\n• Sales partners: sales and lead generation partners who provide us with high-quality leads and\ncustomers at competitive prices. We typically compensate our sales partners on a per customer basis\nfor the sales and lead generation services they perform for us. All contracts are between the customer\nand us, based on a price set by us.\n• Installation partners: trusted installation partners who procure and install a subset of our solar energy\nsystems as our subcontractors and allow us to deploy a mix of in-house and outsourced installation\ncapabilities more efficiently. We compensate our installation partners on a per solar energy system\nbasis for the procurement of materials and installation work they perform for us. Installation partners are\nsolely our subcontractors and do not enter into any agreements with our customers.\nOur ability to connect specialized sales and installation firms on a single platform, which we license to our\nsolar partners at no cost, allows us to enjoy the benefits of vertical integration without the additional fixed cost\nstructure. This creates margin opportunities, system efficiencies and benefits from network effects in matching these\necosystem participants.\n6\nStrategic Partnerships\nOur strategic partnerships encompass relationships with new market entrants not previously engaged in solar,\nincluding consumer marketing, retail and specialized energy retail companies. Our strategic partners find the\nresidential solar market attractive, but recognize that significant barriers to entry make partnerships the preferred\nmethod to reach solar customers. Through these strategic arrangements, we typically market our solar service\nofferings to the strategic partner’s customer base and install the solar energy systems directly or through one of our\nsolar partners. We manage the customer experience and retain the value of the economic relationship through the\nterm of the customer’s contract and potential renewal period. We have executed strategic partnerships in\ncompetitive processes that give us access to millions of potential customers. As our industry grows, we believe that\nour unique platform and deep partnership experience position us to be the partner of choice for new market\nentrants. We believe that these broad strategic relationships will help us drive down our customer acquisition costs\nand make solar accessible to even more customers.\nThe combination of direct-to-consumer, solar partnerships and strategic partnerships offers distinct\nadvantages. The direct-to-consumer channel allows us to scale rapidly, drive incremental unit costs down over the\nlong term, and refine operational processes to share with our partners. Our solar partnerships and strategic\npartnerships enable nimble market entry and exit, while allowing for capital efficient growth. Together, this multi-\nchannel strategy supported by our open platform allows us to reach more customers with our leading solar service\nofferings without compromising our ability to provide exceptional customer service.\nCustomer Agreements\nSince we were founded in 2007, we have been providing solar energy to residential customers at prices\ntypically below utility rates through a variety of offerings, most commonly through our leases and power purchase\nagreements which we refer to as our Customer Agreements. Under our Customer Agreements, customers have the\nright to use and consume all electricity produced by the solar energy system on a continuous basis or, for customers\nwho also opted for our battery storage offerings, stored in batteries which can be discharged as needed. Most\nCustomer Agreements, other than those billed based on generation, entitle the customer to a refund for\nunderproduction below a guaranteed amount, which we refer to as our \"performance guarantee.\" Either directly or\nthrough a solar partner, we construct a solar energy system on a customer’s home which generates electricity at set\nprices through Customer Agreements which typically have an initial term of 20 or 25 years. Rates for both forms of\nour Customer Agreements can be fixed for the duration of the contract or escalated at a pre-determined percentage\nannually. Upon installation, a system is interconnected to the local utility grid. The home’s energy usage is provided\nby the solar energy system with any additional energy needs provided by the local utility. Any excess solar energy\nthat is not immediately used by our customers or stored in batteries is exported to the utility grid using a bi-\ndirectional utility net meter, and in states with net metering, customers generally receive a credit for this excess\npower from their utility to offset future usage of utility-generated energy.\nAlthough many of our customers choose to pay little-to-nothing upfront and instead receive a monthly bill,\nsome customers choose to prepay an amount upfront, thereby reducing their monthly bill. The amount of an upfront\npayment is customized for each customer. Customers may also choose to fully prepay their 20- or 25-year\ncontracts. The prepayment amount is based on the estimated amount of the solar energy system’s output over the\ntypically 20- or 25-year term of the Customer Agreement. If the estimated production of the solar energy system is\nless than the actual production for a given year after the first full one to two years of the agreement, prepaid\ncustomers are refunded the difference at the end of each such year. If the solar energy system’s energy production\nis in excess of the estimate, we allow customers to keep the excess energy at no charge. After the initial term of the\nCustomer Agreement, customers have the option to renew their contracts for the remaining life of the solar energy\nsystem, typically at a 10% discount to then-prevailing power prices, to purchase the system from us at its fair market\nvalue, or have us remove the system.\nRegardless of the type of Customer Agreement our customers choose, we operate the system and agree to\nmonitor it at no cost to the customer. System maintenance is included in our power purchase agreement (“PPA”) or\nlease. We offer an industry-leading performance guarantee to ensure that our customers are receiving the energy\nthey expect at the price they expect. Our customers also receive up to a ten-year warranty for roof penetrations.\n7\nIf a customer sells his or her home, the customer has the right to purchase the system or assign the\nCustomer Agreement to the new homeowner, provided the new homeowner meets our credit requirements and\nagrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Customer Agreement. In connection with this service\ntransfer, the customer may prepay all or a portion of the remaining payments due under the Customer Agreement to\nlower or eliminate the monthly rate to be paid by the new homeowner. If the customer fails to purchase the system\nor assign the Customer Agreement to a new homeowner, we may negotiate directly with the new homeowner to\ntransfer the Customer Agreement (at times on modified terms) and/or look to the original customer to pay all\nremaining payments due. We have completed thousands of service transfers and, from inception through\nDecember 31, 2023, the aggregate expected net present value of the Customer Agreements once assigned\nrepresented approximately 100% of what it was prior to assignment.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our solar energy offerings through a scalable sales organization using both a direct-to-consumer\napproach across online, retail, mass media, digital media, canvassing, field marketing and referral channels as well\nas our diverse partner network. We sell to customers over the phone, online, in the field through canvassing and in-\nhome sales and through our strategic retail sales partnerships. We also partner with sales-only organizations that\nfocus on direct-to-consumer marketing and sales on our behalf, typically with a Sunrun-branded offering at point of\nsale, which further increases our brand and reach. We also generate sales volume through customer referrals.\nCustomer referrals increase in relation to our penetration in a market and shortly after market entry become an\nincreasingly effective way to market our solar energy systems. We believe that a customized, customer-focused\nselling process is important before, during and after the sale of our solar services to maximize our sales success\nand customer experience.\nWe train our sales team to customize their consultative presentation to the individual customer based on\nguidelines and principles outlined in our training materials. We are able to provide our sales team with real-time data\nand pricing tools through our proprietary technology which is designed to generate a tailored product offering with\noptimized pricing based on the actual characteristics of a customer's home, including roof characteristics and\nshading, as well as actual energy usage. This allows our sales team to differentially price homes in the same\ngeographic region quickly and effectively.\nSupply Chain\nWe purchase equipment, including solar panels, inverters and batteries from a limited number of\nmanufacturers and suppliers. If we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with these suppliers and\nmanufacturers, or if one or more that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand reduces or ceases production, it\nmay be difficult to quickly identify and qualify alternatives on acceptable terms. In addition, equipment prices may\nincrease in the coming years, or not decrease at the rates we historically have experienced, due to tariffs or other\nfactors. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors “We have historically benefited from declining costs in our industry,\nand our business and financial results may be harmed as a result of recent and any continued increases in costs\nassociated with our solar service offerings and any failure of these costs to continue declining as we currently\nexpect. If we do not reduce our cost structure in the future, our ability to continue to be profitable may be impaired.”\nSection 201 tariffs on solar modules were imposed beginning in 2018 and were extended through 2026.\nIn addition, federal agencies and Congress are increasing enforcement against the importation of products\nsuspected of being manufactured with forced labor. U.S. customs enforcement and the implementation of a new\nfederal law could negatively impact our supply chain and the availability of products that we use to conduct our\nbusiness. See “Risks Related to the Solar Industry” below for more information.\nCompetition\nWe believe that our primary competitors are the traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential\ncustomers. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price (cents per kilowatt hour),\npredictability of future prices (by providing pre-determined annual price escalations), the backup power capabilities\nof our battery storage solution, and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar\nenergy systems.\n8\nWe also compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the\ntraditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive\nand consumer choice policies, solar companies with business models that are similar to ours, and other renewable\nenergy companies. Some customers might choose to subscribe to a community solar project or renewable\nsubscriber program with these companies or their utilities, instead of installing a solar energy system on their home,\nwhich could affect our sales. Additionally, some utilities offer generation portfolios that are increasingly renewable in\nnature. We believe that we compete favorably with these companies based on our unique multi-channel approach\nand differentiated customer experience.\nWe also face competition from purely finance-driven organizations that acquire customers and then\nsubcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses that seek financing from\nexternal parties, to large construction companies and utilities and sophisticated electrical and roofing companies.\nIntellectual Property\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 54 issued patents and 16 filed patent applications in the United States\nrelating to a variety of aspects of our solar solutions. Our issued U.S. patents will expire 20 years from their\nrespective filing dates, with the earliest expiring in 2029. We intend to file additional patent applications as we\ncontinue to innovate through our research and development efforts.\nGovernment Regulation\nAlthough we are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other\nlocal regulatory regimes where we conduct business, we compete primarily with regulated utilities. As a result, we\nhave developed and are committed to maintaining a policy team to focus on the key regulatory and legislative\nissues impacting the entire industry. We believe these efforts help us better navigate local markets through\nrelationships with key stakeholders and facilitate a deep understanding of the national and regional policy\nenvironment.\nTo operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility.\nDepending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is\nprovided by the local utility directly to us and/or our customers. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are\nissued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other\nregulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering policies. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required\nonce interconnection permission is given.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations\ngoverning the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject\nto the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), the U.S. Department\nof Transportation (“DOT”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We\nendeavor to maintain compliance with applicable DOT, OSHA and other comparable government regulations.\nHowever, we have in the past experienced workplace accidents and received citations from regulators resulting in\nfines, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors “Compliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best\npractices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant penalties,\noperational delays and adverse publicity.” These incidents have not had a material impact on our business or our\nrelations with our employees.\nIn Puerto Rico, we are subject to regulation as an electric power company by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau\nand are required to comply with certain filing, certification, reporting and annual fee requirements. Regulation by the\nPuerto Rico Energy Bureau as an electric power company does not currently subject us to centralized utility-like\nregulation and currently we do not need the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau's approval of charges to customers.\n9\nGovernment Incentives\nFederal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and\nmanufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, payments for\nrenewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from\nproperty tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy from, and\nto lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer adoption of solar energy as an alternative to utility-\nprovided power. In addition, for some investors, the acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that\nreduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment. The federal government\nalso currently offers an investment tax credit (“Commercial ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for the installation of certain energy properties, including solar power facilities\nowned for business purposes.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022,\nand some of its notable provisions include:\n• the eligibility of solar facilities placed in service in 2022 (regardless of when construction began) and\nprior to January 1, 2025 for a 30% Commercial ITC under Section 48(a) of the Code (assuming\napprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements are met; these requirements are deemed met for\nprojects less than 1 MW), with standalone storage beginning in 2023;\n• in the absence of meeting apprenticeship and prevailing wage requirements, the “base” amount of the\nCommercial ITC is 6% for facilities beginning construction prior to January 1, 2025 and 2% thereafter\n(however, as indicated above, the majority of our business qualifies for 30% credits upon which “bonus\ncredits” could increase the total credit amount up to 70% in certain circumstances);\n• the eligibility of solar and storage facilities placed in service after 2024 and through at least 2032 for a\n30% technology-neutral ITC under Section 48E of the Code (the “48E Credit”); and\n• several new ITC bonus credits under both the Commercial ITC and the 48E Credit, which apply to\ncertain facilities placed in service beginning in 2023, including those meeting certain domestic content\nrequirements, those located in “Energy Communities,” and those located in or that benefit low-income\ncommunities and tribal communities.\nThe federal government also offers a personal income tax credit under Section 25D of the Code (“Residential\nClean Energy Credit”), for the installation of certain solar power facilities owned by residential taxpayers, which is\napplicable to customers who purchase a solar energy system outright as opposed to entering into a Customer\nAgreement. The Residential Clean Energy Credit was 26% if the facility was placed in service during 2020 or 2021;\n30% for facilities placed in service from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2032; 26% for facilities placed in\nservice during 2033; and 22% for facilities placed in service during 2034. The Residential Clean Energy Credit is not\navailable for property placed in service after December 31, 2034.\nWe and our tax equity partners have claimed and expect to continue to claim investment tax credits (“ITCs”)\nwith respect to qualifying solar energy projects. In structuring tax equity partnerships and determining ITC eligibility,\nwe have relied upon applicable tax law and published IRS guidance. The U.S. Treasury issued a final rule on the\nITC bonus credit for low-income communities in 2023 and is expected to issue final rules on the other ITC bonus\ncredits in 2024. Some of these final rules may be subject to Congressional Review Act (“CRA”) challenges in 2025,\nbased on legal outcomes determining whether certain final rules are subject to the CRA, and on the date the U.S.\nTreasury finalizes and publishes the final rules.\nMore than half of the states in the U.S., and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives\nfor renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Many states also have\nadopted procurement requirements for renewable energy. Approximately thirty states and the District of Columbia\nhave adopted a renewable portfolio standard (and approximately eight other states have some voluntary goal) that\nrequires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered in the state from eligible\nrenewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such\nmandates, utilities must surrender solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) to the applicable authority. Solar\nenergy system owners such as our investment funds often are able to sell SRECs to utilities directly or in SREC\nmarkets.\n10\nWhile there are numerous federal, state and local government incentives that benefit our business, some\nadverse actions, interpretations or determinations of new or existing laws or regulations could have a negative\nimpact on our business. For example, in the future, Congress could revise or eliminate certain provisions in the IRA\nthat could negatively impact our business, such as reducing the percentage or duration of the ITC. Federal agencies\nmay also issue tax guidance or regulations that could negatively impact our business, by, for example, narrowing\nthe applicability of ITC bonus credits or preventing certain businesses from participating.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Sunrun, we love people and believe that focusing on, and investing in, our people is critical to our\nmission to work together to electrify homes and give all people the joy of clean, abundant energy from the sun.\nAt Sunrun, the foundation of all our talent programs and initiatives is fostering a culture of inclusive,\nconnected and innovative teams. In 2023, we focused on aligning our human capital strategy to support a high\nperformance, customer-focused culture where our employees can thrive and meet our customer needs. We built\nadditional community partnerships focused on attracting candidates from underrepresented populations and\ncontinued to provide learning and development opportunities aimed at promoting engagement and retention.\nInclusion and Diversity. To help us continue to progress toward our goals, we continue to require that a\ndiverse slate of qualified candidates must be presented to hiring managers for all new management-level roles and\nabove. Additionally, we require that our interview panels of all new management-level roles and above include a\ndiverse panel of interviewers. We also have minimum requirements for the length in time that many roles are posted\nto promote consideration of internal candidates and a broader range of external candidates. In 2023, we fostered\ndeeper talent attraction partnerships with local organizations such as Illinois Solar For All (ILSFA) and military\npartnerships such as Skillbridge for hiring retiring military service members. To progress our diversity efforts\n(achieving female director parity and parity in Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) managers), we are\ninvesting in internal career progression programming and a career progression platform we plan to launch in early\n2024. We have grown our Sunrun Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) to promote connection and communication\namong our employees, foster inclusivity, and assist in the development and facilitation of programming to support\npersonal and professional development. Our eight ERGs have grown to a membership of over 1,000 employees as\nof December 31, 2023. Annually, as part of our impact report on environment, sustainability and governance, we\nshare details on our strategies, focus areas, outcomes achieved and workforce demographics.\nHuman Capital. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 10,833 full-time employees, inclusive of\nour active direct-to-home salesforce. Our front-line sales and installation teams are 80% of our total workforce. We\nalso engage independent contractors and consultants. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining\nagreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages.\nHealth and Safety. At Sunrun, we start with safety. We prioritize the safety, health, and welfare of our team\nmembers as part of our people-centric culture. Our safety strategy consists of four pillars: visible leadership,\ntechnical qualification and knowledge, operational discipline, and formal safety communications. To reinforce our\nsafety culture of excellence, we have implemented many initiatives, including an expanded fall protection policy; the\nimplementation of a zero-tolerance policy for violations; a required recurring competent persons and human factors\ntraining; onsite safety visits from the executive leadership team with each front-line manager; the adoption of a\nformal rewards and recognition program; and the incorporation of proactive safety targets within bonus structures.\nAvailable Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 225 Bush Street, Suite 1400, San Francisco, California 94104,\nand our telephone number is (415) 580-6900.

Accordingly, we are, or\nmay become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign\nlaws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such\nobligations may include, without limitation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679\n(“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European\nUnion (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard (“PCI DSS”). Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For\nexample, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act.\nAdditionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which\nrequire us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices\nindividuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) is an example of the increasingly stringent and evolving\nregulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and\nexposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide\nspecific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain\nrequests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s\npersonal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data\ndisclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may\ninclude an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) expanded\nthe CCPA by giving California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establishing\nrestrictions on personal data retention, expanding the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private\nright of action, and establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.\nSee the section titled “Risks Related to Our Business Operations” for additional information about the laws\nand regulations to which we may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and\nregulations.\n12\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in\nour common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the\nrisks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you\ncould lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Solar Industry\nThe solar energy industry is an emerging market which is constantly evolving and may not develop to the\nsize or at the rate we expect.\nThe solar energy industry is an emerging and constantly evolving market opportunity. We believe the solar\nenergy industry is still developing and maturing, and we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at\nthe rate we expect. For example, we have experienced increases in cancellations of our Customer Agreements in\ncertain geographic markets during various periods in our operating history. Any future growth of the solar energy\nmarket and the success of our solar service offerings depend on many factors beyond our control, including\nrecognition and acceptance of the solar service market by consumers, the pricing of alternative sources of energy, a\nfavorable regulatory environment, the continuation of expected tax benefits and other incentives, and our ability to\nprovide our solar service offerings cost effectively. If the markets for solar energy do not develop to the size or at the\nrate we expect, our business may be adversely affected.\nSolar energy has yet to achieve broad market acceptance and depends in part on continued support in the\nform of rebates, tax credits, and other incentives from federal, state and local governments. Additionally, there have\nbeen significant changes in the residential solar policy and pricing framework in California, which is one of our key\nmarkets and represents over 45% of our customer base. Changes to California’s net metering policy adopted in\nDecember 2022 present a significant change to the financial benefits California customers receive from our solar\nsystems and may limit the financial attractiveness of our offerings in this market, particularly for solar-only systems.\nOriginations in California are below levels prior to the Net Billing Tariff (“NBT”) transition, and without further\nincreases in originations, our new installations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. Further, if\nsupport diminishes materially for solar policy related to rebates, tax credits, bill crediting, or other incentives, our\nability to obtain external financing on acceptable terms, or at all, could be materially adversely affected. These types\nof funding limitations could lead to inadequate financing support for the anticipated growth in our business.\nFurthermore, growth in residential solar energy depends in part on macroeconomic conditions, retail prices of\nelectricity and customer preferences, each of which can change quickly. Declining macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding in job markets and residential real estate markets, could contribute to instability and uncertainty among\ncustomers and impact their financial wherewithal, credit scores or interest in entering into long-term contracts, even\nif such contracts would generate immediate and long-term savings.\nFurthermore, market prices of retail electricity generated by utilities or other energy sources could decline for\na variety of reasons, as discussed further below. Any declines in macroeconomic conditions, changes in retail prices\nof electricity or changes in customer preferences would adversely impact our business.\nAchieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require an unprecedented transformation of American energy\nsystems and the adoption of a wide variety of clean energy, storage, and home electrification solutions. Our\nsuccessful deployment of such products will depend on several factors outside our control, including shifting market\nconditions and policy frameworks. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions, to compete successfully with\nexisting or new competitors, and to adopt new or enhanced offerings could limit our growth and have a material\nadverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe have historically benefited from declining costs in our industry, and our business and financial results\nmay be harmed as a result of recent and any continued increases in costs associated with our solar service\n13\nofferings and any failure of these costs to continue declining as we currently expect. If we do not reduce\nour cost structure in the future, our ability to continue to be profitable may be impaired.\nDeclining costs related to raw materials, manufacturing and the sale and installation of our solar service\nofferings have been a key driver in the pricing of our solar service offerings and, more broadly, customer adoption of\nsolar energy. While historically the prices of solar panels and raw materials have declined, the cost of solar panels\nand raw materials have at times increased and may increase in the future, and such products’ availability could\ndecrease, due to a variety of factors, including supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs and trade barriers, export\nregulations, geopolitical conflicts, regulatory or contractual limitations, industry market requirements, and changes in\ntechnology and industry standards.\nFor example, on February 4, 2022, the Biden Administration announced a four-year extension of the 2018\ntariffs imposed in response to a petition filed under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the “Section 201 Tariffs”).\nThe Biden Administration set the Section 201 Tariffs at 14.75%, with a modest rate reduction each year. The\ndecision exempted bifacial modules from the tariffs as well as 5 GW of imported solar cells each year.\nSeparately, in August 2021, an anonymous group of U.S. solar manufacturers filed petitions with the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce (the “DOC”) alleging that Chinese companies were evading antidumping and\ncountervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules, which are used in the\nproduction of solar panels. The petitioners requested a federal investigation into Chinese firms allegedly\ncircumventing tariffs by manufacturing in Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, and sought to apply the existing tariffs on\nChina to companies in these three countries. Ultimately, the DOC objected to the anonymous nature of the petition,\nand it expired. Subsequently, on February 8, 2022, Auxin Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer, submitted a\npetition to the DOC to request country-wide circumvention inquiries pursuant to Section 781(b) of the Tariff Act of\n1930 concerning crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules assembled in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and\nCambodia using Chinese inputs. On April 1, 2022, the DOC initiated the inquiries, and, after conducting an\ninvestigation, issued a preliminary decision on December 2, 2022, recommending that the Biden Administration\nimpose tariffs on certain solar panel imports from the Southeast Asian countries.\nPrior to the DOC issuing its preliminary decision, the Biden Administration in June 2022 issued Presidential\nProclamation 10414, which paused the collection of any new anti-dumping or countervailing duty of certain solar\ncells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam for two years, until June 2024. The\nWhite House initiated this “bridge” action in advance of the DOC’s preliminary decision, in effect deferring any new\nsolar tariffs for 24 months. Even though the White House effectively deferred any new tariffs from taking effect until\nJune 2024, the DOC’s investigation and subsequent preliminary decision had the effect of increasing module prices\nand affecting module supply. In August 2023, the DOC published a final determination in the affirmative, consistent\nwith the preliminary determination. In addition, Congress passed legislation (H.J. Res. 39) in 2023 via procedures of\nthe CRA that would have rescinded Presidential Proclamation 10414 and retroactively imposed tariffs on certain\nimported modules, but President Biden vetoed the legislation on May 16, 2023, and Congress failed to override his\nveto on May 24, 2023. In December 2023, Auxin Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer filed a suit seeking to\noverturn the regulations implementing Presidential Proclamation 10414 and overturn the Biden Administration's\nmoratorium on additional duties and tariffs on certain solar cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia,\nThailand, or Vietnam. In addition, as Presidential Proclamation 10414 expires in June 2024, panel prices may\nincrease.\nIn addition, U.S. laws and regulations intended to prevent the importation of goods manufactured with forced\nlabor has and could continue to affect our business operation and supply chain, including the Uyghur Forced Labor\nPrevention Act and the withhold release order (“WRO”) that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") issued on\nJune 24, 2021 applicable to certain silica-based products manufactured in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region\nof China. Intensive examinations, withhold release orders, and related governmental procedures have resulted in\nsupply chain and operational delays throughout the industry, and we have implemented policies and procedures to\nmaintain compliance and minimize delays. These and similar trade restrictions that may be imposed in the future\ncould cause delivery and installation delays, and restrict the global supply of polysilicon and solar products. This\ncould result in near-term demand for available solar energy systems despite higher costs, increased costs of\npolysilicon and the overall cost of solar energy systems, and equipment shortages, potentially reducing overall\ndemand for and limiting the supply of our products and services.\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the\nUnited States and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by\nother countries in retaliation. The tariffs described above, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the\n14\noccurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs, trade agreements or related policies have\nthe potential to adversely impact our supply chain and access to equipment, our costs and ability to economically\nserve certain markets. Any such cost increases or decreases in availability could slow our growth and cause our\nfinancial results and operational metrics to suffer. We cannot predict whether and to what extent U.S. trade policies\nwill change in the future and cannot ensure that additional tariffs or other restrictive measures will not continue or\nincrease.\nOther factors may also impact costs, such as our choice to make significant investments to drive growth in\nthe future.\nWe face competition from traditional energy companies as well as solar and other renewable energy\ncompanies.\nThe solar energy industry is highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish\nthemselves within their markets and compete with large utilities. We believe that our primary competitors are the\nestablished utilities that supply energy to homeowners by traditional means. We compete with these utilities\nprimarily based on price, predictability of price, and the ease by which homeowners can switch to electricity\ngenerated by our solar service offerings. If we cannot offer compelling value to customers based on these factors,\nthen our business and revenue will not grow. Utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical,\noperational and other resources than we do. As a result of their greater size, utilities may be able to devote more\nresources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving\nindustry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Furthermore, these competitors are able to\ndevote substantially more resources and funding to regulatory and lobbying efforts.\nUtilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them compete with us even if\nthe cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, a majority of utilities’ sources of electricity are non-\nsolar, which may allow utilities to sell electricity more cheaply than we can. Moreover, regulated utilities are\nincreasingly seeking approval to “rate-base” their own residential solar and battery businesses. Rate-basing means\nthat utilities would receive guaranteed rates of return for their solar and battery businesses. This is already\ncommonplace for utility-scale solar projects and commercial solar projects. While few utilities to date have received\nregulatory permission to rate-base residential solar or storage, our competitiveness would be significantly harmed\nshould more utilities receive such permission because we do not receive guaranteed profits for our solar service\nofferings.\nWe face competition from other residential solar service providers, and we also may face competition from\nnew entrants into the market as a result of the passage of the IRA and its impacts and benefits to the solar industry.\nSome of these competitors may have a higher degree of brand name recognition, differing business and pricing\nstrategies, lower barriers to entry into the solar market, and greater capital resources than we have, as well as\nextensive knowledge of our target markets. If we are unable to establish or maintain a consumer brand that\nresonates with customers, maintain high customer satisfaction, or compete with the pricing offered by our\ncompetitors, our sales and market share position may be adversely affected, as our growth is primarily dependent\non originating new customers. We also face competitive pressure from companies that may offer lower-priced\nconsumer offerings than we do.\nIn addition, we compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to\nthe traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. These energy service companies are able\nto offer customers electricity supply-only solutions that are competitive with our solar service offerings on both price\nand usage of solar energy technology while avoiding the long-term agreements and physical installations that our\ncurrent fund-financed business model requires. This may limit our ability to attract customers, particularly those who\nwish to avoid long-term contracts or have an aesthetic or other objection to putting solar panels on their roofs.\nFurthermore, we face competition from purely finance-driven nonintegrated competitors that subcontract out\nthe installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses (including solar partners) that seek financing\nfrom external parties, from large construction companies and from electrical and roofing companies. In addition,\nlocal installers that might otherwise be viewed as potential solar partners may gain market share by being able to be\nthe first providers in new local markets. Some of these competitors may provide energy at lower costs than we do.\nFinally, as declining prices for solar panels and related equipment has resulted in an increase in consumers\n15\npurchasing instead of leasing solar energy systems, we face competition from companies that offer consumer loans\nfor these solar panel purchases.\nAs the solar industry grows and evolves, we will continue to face existing competitors as well as new\ncompetitors who are not currently in the market (including those resulting from the consolidation of existing\ncompetitors) that achieve significant developments in alternative technologies or new products such as storage\nsolutions, EV chargers, loan products, or other programs related to third-party ownership. Our failure to adapt to\nchanging market conditions, to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and to adopt new or\nenhanced technologies could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nA material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other sources would harm\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA customer’s decision to buy solar energy from us often stems from a desire to lower electricity costs.\nDecreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other energy sources would harm our ability to offer\ncompetitive pricing and could harm our business. The price of electricity from utilities could decrease as a result of:\n• the construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas\nor renewable energy technologies;\n• the construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n• a reduction in the price of natural gas or other natural resources;\n• energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption;\n• development of new energy technologies that provide less expensive energy, including storage; and\n• utility rate adjustments and customer class cost reallocation.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase of our solar service offerings less attractive. If\nthe retail price of energy available from utilities were to decrease due to any of these or other reasons, we would be\nat a competitive disadvantage. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers and our growth would be\nlimited.\nThe production and installation of solar energy systems depends heavily on suitable meteorological and\nenvironmental conditions. If meteorological or environmental conditions are unexpectedly unfavorable, the\nelectricity production from our solar service offerings may be below our expectations, and our ability to\ntimely deploy new systems may be adversely impacted.\nThe energy produced and revenue and cash flows generated by a solar energy system depend on suitable\nsolar and weather conditions, both of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, components of our systems, such\nas panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather or natural catastrophes, such as hailstorms,\ntornadoes, fires, or earthquakes. In these circumstances, we generally would be obligated to bear the expense of\nrepairing the damaged solar energy systems that we own. Sustained unfavorable weather or environmental\nconditions also could unexpectedly delay the installation of our solar energy systems, leading to increased\nexpenses and decreased revenue and cash flows in the relevant periods. Extreme weather conditions, as well as\nthe natural catastrophes that could result from such conditions, can severely impact our operations by delaying the\ninstallation of our systems, lowering sales, and causing a decrease in the output from our systems due to smoke or\nhaze. Weather patterns could change, making it harder to predict the average annual amount of sunlight striking\neach location where our solar energy systems are installed. This could make our solar service offerings less\neconomical overall or make individual systems less economical. Any of these events or conditions could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change may have long-term impacts on our business, our industry, and the global economy.\n16\nClimate change poses a systemic threat to the global economy and will continue to do so until our society\ntransitions to renewable energy and decarbonizes. While our core business model seeks to accelerate this\ntransition to renewable energy, there are inherent climate-related risks to our business operations. Warming\ntemperatures throughout the United States, and in California, our biggest market, in particular, have contributed to\nextreme weather, intense drought, and increased wildfire risks. These extreme weather events have the potential to\ndisrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and our customers, and may cause us to incur additional operational\ncosts. They can also cause a decrease in the output from our systems due to smoke or haze. Additionally, if weather\npatterns significantly shift due to climate change, it may be harder to predict the average annual amount of sunlight\nstriking each location where our solar energy systems are installed. This could make our solar service offerings less\neconomical overall or make individual systems less economical.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather events associated with climate change have impacted our operations\nby delaying the installation of our systems, leading to increased expenses and decreased revenue and cash flows.\nFor instance, the series of twelve atmospheric river weather events that deluged the western United States in 2023,\nresulted in prolonged, intense downpour of rain and high wind gusts, and put home roofs under acute stress. As a\nresult, we have seen a larger than usual number of damage claims in 2023, which have resulted in higher\nassociated costs. Continued increases in similar types of extreme weather events may harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur corporate mission is to connect people to the cleanest energy on earth, and we seek to mitigate these\nclimate-related risks not only through our core business model and sustainability initiatives, but also by working with\norganizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks.\nRisks Related to Our Operating Structure and Financing Activities\nWe need to raise capital to finance the continued growth of our operations and solar service business. If\ncapital is not available to us on acceptable terms, as and when needed, our business and prospects would\nbe materially and adversely impacted. In addition, our business is affected by general economic conditions\nand related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Volatility in current economic conditions\ncould adversely impact our business, including our ability to raise financing.\nOur future success depends on our ability to raise capital at acceptable terms from third parties to grow our\nbusiness. To date, we have funded our business principally through low-cost tax equity investment funds. If we are\nunable to establish new investment funds when needed, or upon desirable terms, the growth of our solar service\nbusiness would be impaired. Changes in tax law or changes in the interpretation of existing tax law could also affect\nour ability to establish such tax equity investment funds, impact the terms of existing or future funds, or reduce the\npool of capital available for us to grow our business.\nThe passage of the IRA, which extended subsidies for various renewable energy technologies, is expected\nto lead to additional demands for tax equity. As a result, availability of tax equity may present constraints to our\ngrowth and harm our financial performance. In addition, terms for tax equity funds, including the realization of tax\ncredit value through potential structures that utilize transferability of the ITC, may not be at terms we view as\nfavorable.\nThe contract terms in certain of our existing investment fund documents contain various conditions with\nrespect to our ability to draw on financing commitments from the fund investors, including conditions that restrict our\nability to draw on such commitments if an event occurs that could reasonably be expected to have a material\nadverse effect on the fund or, in some instances, us. If we are not able to satisfy such conditions due to events\nrelated to our business, a specific investment fund, developments in our industry, including tax or regulatory\nchanges, or otherwise, and as a result, we are unable to draw on existing funding commitments, we could\nexperience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects. If any of the investors that currently invest in our investment funds decide not to invest in future\ninvestment funds to finance our solar service offerings due to general market conditions, concerns about our\nbusiness or prospects, decreased appetite for tax benefits or any other reason, or materially change the terms\nunder which they are willing to provide future financing, we would need to identify new investors to invest in our\ninvestment funds and our cost of capital may increase.\n17\nIn addition, our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital\nmarkets and the economy. A general slowdown or volatility in current economic conditions, the level of U.S. national\ndebt, currency fluctuations, unemployment rates, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. housing market, tariffs,\ntrade wars, inflation levels, interest rates, energy costs, and concerns over a slowing economy or other factors,\ncould adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise financing.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully access capital in a manner that\nsupports the growth of our business. Certain sources of capital may not be available in the future, and competition\nfor any available funding may increase. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of\nfunding without incurring high funding costs, unfavorable changes in the terms of funding instruments or the\nliquidation of certain assets. If we are unable to continue to offer a competitive investment profile, we may lose\naccess to these funds or they may only be available on less favorable terms than those provided to our competitors\nor currently provided to us. If we are unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms,\nour business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nVolatility and increases in interest rates raise our cost of capital and may adversely impact our business.\nWhile interest rates had been at long-term historic lows during large parts of our operating history, they have\nincreased in recent years, and may continue to increase. Rising interest rates, including recent historic increases\nstarting in 2021, have resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in our advance rates, reducing the\nproceeds we receive from certain investment funds. Because our financing structure is sensitive to volatility in\ninterest rates, higher rates increase our cost of capital and decrease the amount of capital available to us to finance\nthe deployment of new solar energy systems. Additionally, we have selectively increased pricing in many markets\nover the last year in response to higher interest rates, and may continue to do so in the future, which may impact\nthe overall attractiveness of our offerings to potential new customers. Our future success depends on our ability to\nraise capital from fund investors and obtain secured lending to help finance the deployment of our solar service\nofferings. Part of our business strategy is to seek to reduce our cost of capital through such financing arrangements\nto improve our margins, offset reductions in government incentives and maintain the price competitiveness of our\nsolar service offerings. Rising base interest rates or credit spreads, which have been, and may continue to be,\nworsened by inflation, an economic recession, or other variables, may have an adverse impact on our ability to offer\nattractive pricing on our solar service offerings to customers, which could negatively impact sales of our solar\nenergy offerings and our cash flows. Because we typically enter into interest rate swaps shortly after the installation\nof a system, we are subject to higher interest rate risk between customer pricing through system installation, which\nmay cause volatility to our cash flows.\nThe majority of our cash flows to date have been from solar service offerings under Customer Agreements\nthat have been monetized under various investment fund structures. One of the components of this monetization is\nthe present value of the payment streams from customers who enter into these Customer Agreements. If the rate of\nreturn required by capital providers, including debt providers, rises as a result of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce\nthe present value of the customer payment stream and consequently reduce the total value derived from this\nmonetization. Any measures that we could take to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates could ultimately have\nan adverse impact on the value proposition that we offer customers.\nWe expect to incur substantially more debt in the future, which could intensify the risks to our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in\nour debt instruments. Some of our existing debt arrangements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness,\nincluding secured indebtedness, and we may be subject to similar restrictions under the terms of future debt\narrangements. These restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. Increases in our existing\ndebt obligations would further heighten the debt related risk discussed above.\nFurthermore, there is no assurance that we will be able to enter into new debt instruments on acceptable\nterms or at all. If we were unable to satisfy financial covenants and other terms under existing or new instruments,\nor obtain waivers or forbearance from our lenders, or if we were unable to obtain refinancing or new financings for\nour working capital, equipment, and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed, our business would be\nadversely affected.\n18\nWe may be required to make payments or contribute assets to our investors upon the occurrence of certain\nevents, including one-time reset or true-up payments or upon the exercise of a redemption option by one of\nour tax equity investors.\nOur investors in our tax equity investment funds typically advance capital to us based on, among other\nthings, production capacity estimates. The models we use to calculate prepayments in connection with certain of\nour tax equity investment funds are updated at a fixed date occurring after placement in service of all applicable\nsolar energy systems or an agreed upon date (typically within the first year of the applicable term) to reflect certain\nspecified conditions, as they exist at such date including the ultimate system size of the equipment that was sold or\nleased to the tax equity investment fund, the cost thereof, and the date the equipment went into service. In some\ncases, these true-up models also incorporate any changes in law, which would include any reduction in rates (and\nthus any reduction in the benefits of depreciation). As a result of this true-up, applicable payments are resized, and\nwe may be obligated to refund a portion of the tax equity investor’s prepayments or to contribute additional assets to\nthe tax equity investment fund. In addition, certain of our tax equity fund investors have the right to require us to\npurchase their interests in the tax equity investment funds after a set period of time, generally at a price equal to the\ngreater of a set purchase price or fair market value of the interests at the time of the repurchase. Any significant\nrefunds, capital contributions, or purchases that we may be required to make could adversely affect our liquidity or\nfinancial condition.\nLoan financing developments could adversely impact our business.\nThe third-party ownership structure, which we bring to market through our solar service offerings, continues\nto be the predominant form of system ownership in the residential solar market in many states. However, with the\ndevelopment of new loan financing products, we have seen a modest shift from leasing and power purchase\narrangements to outright purchases of the solar energy system by the customer (i.e., a customer purchases the\nsolar energy system outright instead of leasing the system or buying power from us). Continued increases in third-\nparty loan financing products and outright purchases could result in the demand for long-term Customer\nAgreements to decline, which would require us to shift our product focus to respond to the market trend and could\nhave an adverse effect on our business. The majority of our customers have historically chosen our solar service\nofferings as opposed to buying a solar energy system outright. Our financial model is impacted by the volume of\ncustomers who choose our solar service offerings, and an increase in the number of customers who choose to\npurchase solar energy systems (whether for cash or through third-party financing) may harm our business and\nfinancial results.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash to comply with certain covenants and satisfy\npayment obligations, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial\ndebt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may\nnot be successful.\nWe have substantial amounts of debt, including our convertible senior notes (“Notes”), our credit facility and\nthe non-recourse debt facilities entered into by our subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail in the section titled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated\nfinancial statements, in each case, included in this periodic report. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the\nprincipal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject\nto economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to\ngenerate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital\nexpenditures to operate our business. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt\none or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms\nthat may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to timely repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness will\ndepend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of\nthese activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt\nobligations and negatively impact our financial condition and prospects.\nIndebtedness under certain of our Senior and Subordinated Debt Facilities and our other credit facilities\naccrue interest at variable interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or other\nbenchmark rates based thereof, collectively, “SOFR”).\n19\nIn certain of our debt facilities accruing interest based on SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on\noccasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time\nmay bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. Additionally, some of our credit\nfacilities based on SOFR include a credit spread adjustment on SOFR due to LIBOR representing an unsecured\nlending rate while SOFR represents a secured lending rate. In addition, ARRC has imposed certain curbs on\ninterdealer trading in SOFR derivatives, which reduce market liquidity and may raise hedging costs for us as end-\nusers. The possible volatility of, and uncertainty around, SOFR as the LIBOR replacement rate, the addition of credit\nspread adjustment in certain of our facilities, and potential illiquidity in SOFR derivative markets could result in\nhigher borrowing costs for us, which would adversely affect our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to\nrepurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our\nability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nThe Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence\nof a fundamental change under the indenture, which includes certain events such as a change of control, before the\nmaturity date at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be\nrepurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we\nelect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of\ndelivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to\nmake repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash for Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to\nrepurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or\nby agreements governing our indebtedness at the time.\nOur failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such\nNotes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute\na default. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under\nagreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be\naccelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the\nindebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nIn connection with our issuance of the Notes in January 2021, we entered into privately negotiated capped\ncall transactions (the “Capped Call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the \"option counterparties\"). The\noption counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk\nthat one or more of such option counterparties may default under the Capped Call transactions. Our exposure to the\ncredit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes\nsubject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, with respect to such option counterparty’s obligations under\nthe relevant Capped Call transaction, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal\nto our exposure at that time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an\nincrease in our exposure will be positively correlated to an increase in our common stock market price and in the\nvolatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by any of the option counterparties, we\nmay suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance\nas to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Policy\nThe customer value proposition for distributed solar, storage, and home electrification products is\ninfluenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of\nelectricity not consumed on site and exported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of customers’ utility\nbills, various policies related to the permitting and interconnection costs of our products to homes and the\ngrid, the availability of incentives for solar, batteries, and other electrification products, and other policies\nwhich allow aggregations of our systems to provide the grid value. Significant changes to any of these\nfactors may impact the competitiveness of our service offerings to customers.\n20\nThe value proposition of our solar and storage offering, as well as our other related home electrification\nofferings, such as the electric vehicle charging station, is impacted by several factors outside of our control\nincluding, but are not limited to, the retail price of electricity, the valuation of electricity not consumed on site but\nexported to the grid, the rate design mechanisms of customers’ utility bills, various policies related to the permitting\nand interconnection costs of our products to homes and the grid, the availability of incentives for solar, batteries,\nand other electrification products, and other policies which allow aggregations of our systems to provide the grid\nvalue. For over two decades across the United States, utilities, their trade associations, fossil fuel interests, and\nsome other stakeholders not aligned with a decentralized grid have been challenging many legislative and\nregulatory policies that enhance the customer value proposition of residential solar and storage.\nIn connection with the value attributed to exported electricity, net metering (“NEM”) has traditionally been\nthe main policy mechanism to measure and value exported electricity sent back to the grid in the markets within\nwhich we do business. That value has always varied depending on the retail price of power in a certain market,\nsubstantial differences in rate design per market, and NEM market specific differences, including detail around how\nto carry over NEM credits, whether or not to cap the amount of net metered solar in a specific market, or how a\nmarket values the exported electricity. A substantial majority of the markets in which we operate have implemented\nNEM policies, allowing end customers to receive credits for the electricity not consumed on site and exported to the\ngrid.\nSome states, including our largest market of California, have moved away from the traditional retail NEM\ncredit structure of paying the full retail rate for exported electricity, and instead, such states have chosen to value\nexcess generation by customers’ solar systems in different ways. In 2016, the Arizona Corporation Commission\n(“ACC”) replaced retail NEM with a declining fixed export rate. In 2017, Nevada implemented a reduced credit step\ndown to NEM credits over time. Hawaii, a state with extremely high distributed solar penetration, effectively ended\nNEM in 2016 and has since become a solar plus battery market, with programs that utilize additional values from\naggregated distributed resources, including rooftop solar paired with batteries, to support grid needs. Many states\nacross the United States have traditionally set limits on the amount of rooftop solar that can be exported for retail\ncredit and there is a long legislative and regulatory history of those limitations being extended in various states,\nincluding California, New Jersey, Illinois, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\nOur ability to sell our solar service offerings may be adversely impacted by the failure to extend existing limits\nor “caps” to retail NEM or the elimination of other existing policies that value exported electricity to the grid. On April\n26, 2022, Florida Governor DeSantis vetoed legislation that would have established a threshold date and\npercentage trigger when retail NEM could have faced declines in the immediate export rate in Florida. New Jersey\ncurrently has no NEM cap but reached a threshold that triggers regulatory review of its NEM policy, which will\nproceed over the next two years.\nMost notably, as a result of the finalization of the NEM proceeding on December 15, 2022 by the California\nPublic Utilities Commission (“CPUC”), California has moved to a NBT structure in which exported electricity is no\nlonger valued at the retail rate and is instead valued by that state’s “avoided cost” annual calculations, which\nsubstantially decreased the credit allocated to an exported electron during the day. The final California NEM\ndecision rejected a very controversial solar specific fixed charge and rejected the creation of new non-bypassable\ncharges, minimum bills, and grid participation charges for solar and solar plus storage customers. Additionally, the\nfinal California NEM decision made no retroactive changes to legacy NEM 1.0 or 2.0 California customers. In mid-\nApril 2023, new California solar customers located in areas serviced by investor-owned utilities (“IOU”) began\napplying for service under the new NBT.\nThe final California NEM decision presents a significant change to the residential solar market in California.\nUnder this new framework, storage paired with solar will have a heightened value proposition to customers, and we\nmay see increased demand for our solar plus storage offerings, thereby increasing the importance of procuring a\nvariety of battery storage products and potentially accentuating supply chain risks related to battery storage\nsystems. The new NBT pricing framework may also result in the introduction of new product offerings and pricing\nstructures by our competitors throughout the solar and utilities industries, and has led to our introduction of Sunrun\nShift™, our home solar subscription offering that maximizes the value of solar energy under California's NBT by\nincreasing self-consumption during peak hours when rates are highest and reducing low-value exports back to the\ngrid through the use of a new storage configuration. This may also result in increased competition and uncertainty\nregarding the demand for such new products and offerings, which may adversely impact our business and results of\noperations.\n21\nIn 2022, before the final California NEM decision, California passed legislation (AB 205) which provided the\nCPUC with the ability to implement three tiers of income-graduated fixed charges on all California customers above\nthe previous $10 per month maximum. In mid-April 2023, new California solar customers located in areas serviced\nby IOUs began applying for service under the new NBT. Subsequently, in early April 2023, the California IOUs filed\nan initial proposal that would represent the highest fixed charges in the United States for all residential customers\nsubject to IOU electricity service in California. In a June 2023 ruling, the CPUC indicated that it will approve by July\n2024 guidelines for future development and implementation of income-graduated fixed charges, but that\nimplementation of the first iteration of these charges is not expected to occur until late 2026. Legislation (AB 1999)\nhas recently been introduced seeking to repeal the 2022 legislation that authorized income-graduated fixed\ncharges. Depending on the outcome of the legislation and the CPUC proceeding, which is currently considering the\nsize of the fixed charges, how the income categories are determined, and rate design for future solar plus storage\ncustomers, the value proposition for our customers would be impacted. The pending determination may also result\nin uncertainty regarding demand for such new products and offerings, which may adversely impact our business\nand results of operations. Additionally, the imposition of charges may disproportionately impact or specifically single\nout homeowners who have installed solar energy systems, including our customers, which could adversely impact\nour business.\nElectric utility statutes and regulations and changes to such statutes or regulations may present technical,\nregulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of our solar service offerings that may\nsignificantly reduce demand for such offerings.\nFederal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the\nmarket for our solar service offerings and are constantly evolving. These statutes, regulations, and administrative\nrulings relate to electricity pricing, net metering, consumer protection, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities\nand the interconnection of homeowner-owned and third party-owned solar energy systems to the electrical grid.\nThese statutes and regulations are constantly evolving. Governments, often acting through state utility or public\nservice commissions, change and adopt different rates for residential customers on a regular basis and these\nchanges can have a negative impact on our ability to deliver savings, or energy bill management, to customers.\nIn addition, many utilities, their trade associations, and fossil fuel interests in the country, which have\nsignificantly greater economic, technical, operational, and political resources than the residential solar industry, are\ncurrently challenging solar-related policies, which may have the effect of reducing the competitiveness of residential\nsolar energy. Any adverse changes in solar-related policies could have a negative impact on our business and\nprospects.\nRegulations and policies related to rate design could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar\nservice offerings, reduce the value of the electricity our systems produce, and reduce any savings that our\ncustomers could realize from our solar service offerings.\nAll states regulate investor-owned utility retail electricity pricing. In addition, there are numerous publicly\nowned utilities and electric cooperatives that establish their own retail electricity pricing through some form of\nregulation or internal process. These regulations and policies could deter potential customers from purchasing our\nsolar service offerings. For example, some utilities in states such as Arizona and Utah have sought and secured\nrate design changes that reduce the credit for residential solar exports to below the retail rate and impose new\ncharges for rooftop solar customers. Utilities in additional states may follow suit. Such rate changes can include\nchanging rates to charge lower volume-based rates—the rates charged for kilowatt hours of electricity purchased by\na residential customer—while raising unavoidable fixed charges that an end customer is subject to when they\npurchase solar energy from third parties, and levying charges on homeowners based on their point of maximum\ndemand during a month (referred to as “demand charge”). For example, the Arizona Public Service Company offers\nresidential demand charge rate plans and if our solar customers have subscribed to those plans, they may not\nrealize typical savings from our offerings. These forms of rate design could adversely impact our business by\nreducing the value of the electricity our solar energy systems produce compared to retail net metering, and reducing\nany savings customers realize by purchasing our solar service offerings. These proposals could continue or be\nreplicated in other states. In addition to changes in general rates charged to all residential customers, utilities\nsometimes have proposed solar-specific charges (which may be fixed charges, capacity-based charges, or other\nrate charges). Any of these changes could materially reduce the demand for our offerings and could limit the\nnumber of markets in which our offerings are competitive with electricity provided by the utilities.\n22\nWe are not currently regulated as a utility under applicable laws, but we may be subject to regulation as a\nutility in the future or become subject to new federal and state regulations for any additional solar service\nofferings we may introduce in the future.\nMost federal, state, and municipal laws do not currently regulate us as a utility. As a result, we are not subject\nto the various regulatory requirements applicable to U.S. utilities. However, federal, state, local or other applicable\nregulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan\nby prohibiting or otherwise restricting our sale of electricity. These regulatory requirements could include restricting\nour sale of electricity, as well as regulating the price of our solar service offerings. For example, the New York Public\nService Commission and the Illinois Power Agency have issued orders requiring registration of distributed energy\nproviders in certain ways similar to energy service companies, which increases the regulatory compliance burden\nfor us in such states. If we become subject to the same regulatory authorities as utilities in other states or if new\nregulatory bodies are established to oversee our business, our operating costs could materially increase and we\nmay not be able to execute on our business plans.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party-owned solar energy systems.\nOur Customer Agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face\nregulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. These challenges pertain to issues such as whether third-\nparty-owned systems qualify for the same rebates, tax exemptions or other non-tax incentives available for\nhomeowner-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party-owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives,\nwhether our Customer Agreements are properly characterized as leases or PPAs, and whether third-party-owned\nsystems are eligible for net metering and the associated significant cost savings. In 2021, South Carolina enacted\nlegislation providing a solar property tax exemption. Texas and Connecticut clarified through legislation that third-\nparty-owned residential solar systems would be treated the same as customer-owned systems, and would qualify\nfor the existing residential solar property tax exemption. Adverse regulatory treatment of third-party ownership\narrangements could reduce demand for our solar service offerings, adversely impact our access to capital and\ncause us to increase the price we charge customers for energy.\nInterconnection limits or circuit-level caps imposed by regulators may significantly reduce our ability to sell\nelectricity from our solar service offerings in certain markets or slow interconnections, harming our growth\nrate and customer satisfaction scores.\nInterconnection rules establish the circumstances in which rooftop solar will be connected to the electricity\ngrid. Interconnection limits or circuit-level caps imposed by regulators may curb our growth in key markets. Utilities\nthroughout the country have different rules and regulations regarding interconnection and some utilities cap or limit\nthe amount of solar energy that can be interconnected to the grid. Our systems do not provide power to customers\nuntil they are interconnected to the grid, and some relevant laws and regulations in certain markets may\nconsiderably slow the timing of interconnection, which may in turn impact the system production and our business\nand sales results.\nInterconnection regulations are based on claims from utilities regarding the amount of solar energy that can\nbe connected to the grid without causing grid reliability issues or requiring significant grid upgrades. Although recent\nrulings from the Hawaii Utilities Commission have helped resolve some problems, historically, interconnection limits\nor circuit-level caps have slowed the pace of our installations in Hawaii. Similar interconnection limits could slow our\nfuture installations in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Colorado, New Jersey, or other markets, harming our growth rate and\ncustomer satisfaction scores. Similarly, the California, Illinois, and Hawaii Public Utilities Commissions require the\nactivation of some advanced inverter functionality to head off presumed grid reliability issues, which may require\nmore oversight of the operation of the solar energy systems over time, but may also help ensure circuits remain\nopen or interconnection costs remain low. Interconnection constraints and limits may hamper our ability to sell our\nofferings in certain markets and increase our costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results, financial\ncondition, and prospects. We expect utility requirements to incorporate these advanced functions provided by the\nIEEE 1547-2018/UL-1741 SB inverters and that they will become more commonplace. Additional states are\nexpected to adopt the usage of advanced inverters to align with California's anticipated requirement that all new\nsystems use inverters certified to the new UL 1741 SB standard. This requirement became effective in March 2023.\nAll of our vendors are certified to this standard.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\n23\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties, including our solar\npartners.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to develop or expand our relationships with third parties. For\nexample, we are investing resources in establishing strategic relationships with market players across a variety of\nindustries, including large retailers, to generate new customers. These programs may not roll out as quickly as\nplanned or produce the results we anticipated. A significant portion of our business depends on attracting and\nretaining new and existing solar partners. Negotiating relationships with our solar partners, investing in due\ndiligence efforts with potential solar partners, training such third parties and contractors, and monitoring them for\ncompliance with our standards require significant time and resources and may present greater risks and challenges\nthan expanding a direct sales or installation team. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our\nrelationships with these third parties, our ability to grow our business and address our market opportunity could be\nimpaired. Even if we are able to establish and maintain these relationships, we may not be able to execute on our\ngoal of leveraging these relationships to meaningfully expand our business, brand recognition and customer base.\nThis would limit our growth potential and our opportunities to generate significant additional revenue or cash flows.\nWe and our solar partners depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, batteries, and other\nsystem components to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings. Any shortage,\nbottlenecks, delay, detentions, or component price change from these suppliers, or the acquisition of any\nof these suppliers by a competitor, could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of\nmarket share.\nWe and our solar partners purchase solar panels, inverters, batteries, and other system components from a\nlimited number of suppliers, making us susceptible to quality issues, shortages, bottlenecks, and price changes. If\nwe or our solar partners fail to develop, maintain and expand our relationships with these or other suppliers, we may\nbe unable to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings, or we may only be able to offer our\nsystems at higher costs or after delays. If one or more of the suppliers that we or our solar partners rely upon to\nmeet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production, we may be unable to quickly identify alternate suppliers or\nto qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and we may be unable to satisfy this demand.\nThe acquisition of a supplier by one of our competitors could also limit our access to such components and\nrequire significant redesigns of our solar energy systems or installation procedures and have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nIn particular, there is a limited number of suppliers of inverters, which are components that convert electricity\ngenerated by solar panels into electricity that can be used to power the home. For example, once we design a\nsystem for use with a particular inverter, if that type of inverter is not readily available at an anticipated price, we\nmay incur delays and additional expenses to redesign the system. Further, the inverters on our solar energy\nsystems generally carry only ten year warranties. If there is an inverter equipment shortage in a year when a\nsubstantial number of inverters on our systems need to be replaced, we may not be able to replace the inverters to\nmaintain proper system functioning or may be forced to do so at higher than anticipated prices, either of which\nwould adversely impact our business.\nSimilarly, there is a limited number of suppliers of batteries. Once we design a system for use with a\nparticular battery, if that type of battery is not readily available from our supplier, we may incur delays and additional\nexpenses to install the system or be forced to redesign the system. Cost and mass production of battery cells\ndepends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals.\nThe prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions\nand global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles\nand energy storage products, global demand has increased for lithium-ion battery cells, which may cause\nchallenges for our battery suppliers, including delays or price volatility. Any such delays or reduced availability of\nbattery cells (or other component materials) may impact our sales and operating results. Further, these risks may\nincrease as market demand for our solar and battery offering grows. Any reduced availability of these batteries may\nimpact our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs\nthrough increased prices. Our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand,\ngrowth, prospects and operating results.\n24\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels, batteries\nand inverters, in times of rapid industry growth or regulatory change. Further, new or unexpected changes in rooftop\nfire codes or building codes may require new or different system components to satisfy compliance with such newly\neffective codes or regulations, which may not be readily available for distribution to us or our suppliers. The\nmanufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires significant capital\ninvestment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to\nmeet demand for these components and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to install systems in a timely\nmanner. Additionally, any decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currency of our\ncomponent suppliers could increase our component prices. Any of these shortages, delays or price changes could\nlimit our growth, cause cancellations or adversely affect our operating margins, and result in loss of market share\nand damage to our brand.\nHuman rights issues in foreign countries and the U.S. government response to them could also disrupt our\nsupply chain and operations. In particular, the WRO issued by the CBP on June 24, 2021 applicable to certain\nsilica-based products manufactured in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, and any other allegations\nregarding forced labor in China and U.S. trade regulations to prohibit the importation of any goods derived from\nforced labor, could affect our operations. Further, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that President Biden\nsigned into law on December 23, 2021, which took effect on June 21, 2022, has affected, and may continue to\naffect, our supply chain and operations. Intensive examinations, withhold release orders, and related governmental\nprocedures have resulted in supply chain and operational delays throughout the industry, and we have implemented\npolicies and procedures to maintain compliance and minimize delays. These and other similar trade restrictions that\nmay be imposed in the future could cause delivery and installation delays, and restrict the global supply of\npolysilicon and solar products. This, coupled with the passage of the IRA, could result in near-term demand for\navailable solar energy systems despite higher costs, as well as increased costs of polysilicon and the overall cost of\nsolar energy systems, potentially reducing overall demand for our products and services.\nIn addition, our supply chain and operations (or those of our partners) could be subject to events beyond our\ncontrol, such as earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, hurricanes, tsunamis, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, droughts,\ntornadoes, the effects of climate change and related extreme weather, public health issues and pandemics, war,\nterrorism, government restrictions or limitations on trade, and geo-political unrest and uncertainties, such as\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine and the current armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip. We currently do not, and do\nnot plan to in the future, source any products, materials, components, parts, or services directly from providers in\nthese regions. As a result, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our supply chain directly arising from these\nconflicts at this time.\nAs the primary entity that contracts with customers, we are subject to risks associated with construction,\ncost overruns, delays, customer cancellations, regulatory compliance, and other contingencies, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a licensed contractor in certain communities that we service, and we are ultimately responsible as the\ncontracting party for every solar energy system installation. We may be liable, either directly or through our solar\npartners, to customers for any damage we cause to them, their home, belongings, or property during the installation\nof our systems. For example, we, either directly or through our solar partners, frequently penetrate customers’ roofs\nduring the installation process and may incur liability for the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations\nfollowing the completion of construction. In addition, because the solar energy systems we or our solar partners\ndeploy are high voltage energy systems, we may incur liability for any failure to comply with electrical standards and\nmanufacturer recommendations.\nFor example, on December 2, 2020, the California Contractors State License Board (the “CSLB”) filed an\nadministrative proceeding against us and certain of our officers related to an accident that occurred during an\ninstallation by one of our affiliate channel partners, Horizon Solar Power, which held its own license with the CSLB.\nOn November 8, 2021, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement imposing citations and withdrawing the\nadministrative proceeding with additional conditions. We consistently denied wrongdoing concerning the allegations\nin the administrative proceeding and made no admissions of wrongdoing incident to the settlement. We could face\nother similar claims or proceedings in the future, which, if not resolved favorably, could potentially result in fines,\npublic reprimand, probation, or the suspension or revocation of certain of our licenses.\nCompleting the sale and installation of a solar energy system requires many different steps including a site\naudit, completion of designs, permitting, installation, electrical sign-off and interconnection. Customers may cancel\ntheir Customer Agreement, subject to certain conditions, during this process until commencement of installation,\n25\nand we have experienced increased customer cancellations in certain geographic markets during certain periods in\nour operating history. We or our solar partners may face customer cancellations, delays or cost overruns which may\nadversely affect our or our solar partners’ ability to ramp up the volume of sales or installations in accordance with\nour plans. These cancellations, delays or overruns may be the result of a variety of factors, such as labor shortages\nor other labor issues, defects in materials and workmanship, adverse weather conditions, transportation constraints,\nconstruction change orders, site changes or roof conditions, geographic factors, extended permitting and inspection\ntimes and other unforeseen difficulties or any other factors that may extend the timing to install, any of which could\nlead to increased cancellation rates, reputational harm and other adverse effects. For example, some customer\norders are canceled after a site visit if we determine that a customer needs to make repairs to or install a new roof,\nor that there is excessive shading on their property. Additionally, as the demand for solar plus storage offerings\ngrows, we anticipate facing additional operational challenges associated with the complexity of deploying storage\nsolutions that tend to have longer cycle times due to factors such as lengthened permitting and inspection times and\npotential need of a main panel upgrade. Any such factors that extend the timeframes from customer signature to\ninstallation or increased project complexity may result in increased operational challenges and correspondingly\nlower realization rates. If we continue to experience increased customer cancellations, our financial results may be\nmaterially and adversely affected. In addition, the current macroeconomic environment, including rising interest\nrates, instability in financial markets and bank failures, may impact our ability to engage with new customers and\nexpand our relationships with existing customers. If our customers are materially negatively impacted by these\nfactors, our business could be negatively impacted.\nPolicy can impact solar installation completion timelines. For example, in fall 2022, California passed SB 379,\nwhich imposes a required timeline for cities and counties to implement an online, automated solar permitting\nplatform like SolarAPP+. Cities with populations over 50,000 and counties with populations over 150,000 will need\nto have instant, online, automated residential solar and storage permitting as of September 30, 2023, which may\nincrease the rate at which we install solar systems.\nIn addition, the installation of solar energy systems and other energy-related products requiring building\nmodifications are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state and local laws and\nordinances relating to building, fire and electrical codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and\nmetering, and related matters. We also rely on certain of our and our partners' employees to maintain professional\nlicenses in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our failure to employ properly licensed personnel\ncould adversely affect our licensing status in those jurisdictions. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of\nevery individual authority having jurisdiction over our installations and to design solar energy systems to comply with\nthese varying standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems may result in\nsignificant additional expenses to us and our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in\ndemand for our solar service offerings.\nWe have a variety of stringent quality standards that we apply in the selection, supervision, and oversight of\nour third-party suppliers and solar partners. We exercise oversight over our partners through written agreements\nrequiring compliance with the laws and requirements of all jurisdictions, including regarding safety and consumer\nprotections, by oversight of compliance with these agreements, and enforced by termination of a partner\nrelationship for failure to meet those obligations. However, because our suppliers and partners are third parties,\nultimately, we cannot guarantee that they will follow our standards or ethical business practices, such as fair wage\npractices and compliance with environmental, safety and other local laws, despite our efforts to hold them\naccountable to our standards. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers or\ncontractors, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery or installation of our products, product\nshortages or other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers and solar partners\nor the divergence of a supplier’s or solar partner's labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical\nin the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm\nour business, brand and reputation in the market.\nIf we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business\nplan, maintain high levels of customer service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods and we intend to continue to expand our business\nwithin existing markets, such as Puerto Rico, and in a number of new locations in the future, and with our product\nofferings, such as EV chargers. This growth has placed, and any future growth may continue to place, a significant\nstrain on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. In particular, we have been in the past, and may\nin the future, be required to expand, train and manage our growing employee base and solar partners. Our\n26\nmanagement will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers, and other\nthird parties and attract new customers and suppliers, as well as to manage multiple geographic locations.\nIn addition, our current and planned operations, personnel, systems and procedures might be inadequate to\nsupport our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure,\nincluding additional costs for the expansion of our employee base and our solar partners as well as marketing and\nbranding costs. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage\nthese changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take\nadvantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures. This could\nalso result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulties in introducing new solar service\nofferings or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and the cost of maintenance, repair and removal on solar energy systems\nthat are owned or leased by our investment funds.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and are generally obligated to cover the cost of maintenance, repair and\nremoval for any solar energy system that we sell or lease to our investment funds. At the time we sell or lease a\nsolar energy system to an investment fund, we enter into a maintenance services agreement where we agree to\noperate and maintain the system for a fixed fee that is calculated to cover our future expected maintenance costs. If\nour solar energy systems require an above-average amount of repairs or if the cost of repairing systems were\nhigher than our estimate, we would need to perform such repairs without additional compensation. If our solar\nenergy systems, more than 45% of which were located in California as of December 31, 2023, are damaged as the\nresult of a natural disaster beyond our control, losses could exceed or be excluded from, our insurance policy limits,\nand we could incur unforeseen costs that could harm our business and financial condition. We may also incur\nsignificant costs for taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, such events. We purchase property\ninsurance with industry standard coverage and limits approved by an investor’s third-party insurance advisors to\nhedge against such risk, but such coverage may not cover our losses.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary\ndamages.\nIf our solar service offerings, including our racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or\nother products, injured someone, we would be exposed to product liability claims. Because solar energy systems\nand many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that\ncustomers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether by product malfunctions, defects,\nimproper installation or other causes. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our\nsolar partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate\nproduct liability insurance. Our solar energy systems, including our photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, and\nother products, may also be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects. Any product liability claim we\nface could be expensive to defend and divert management’s attention. The successful assertion of product liability\nclaims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant\npayments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely\naffect sales of our systems and other products. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects or other\nproblems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market\nconditions to the industry as a whole, and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract customers, thus\naffecting our growth and financial performance.\nOur business is concentrated in certain markets, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, California represented over 45% of our customer base. This concentration of our\ncustomer base and operational infrastructure could lead to our business and results of operations being particularly\nsusceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in this market and in other\nmarkets that may become similarly concentrated, in particular the east coast, where we have seen significant\ngrowth recently. Recent changes to net metering policy and the tariff structure in California in December 2022 have\ncreated additional uncertainty and challenges, given the size of our customer base in California. Originations in\nCalifornia continue to be below levels prior to the NBT transition, and without further increases in originations, our\n27\nnew installations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.\nOur corporate and sales headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, an area that has a\nheightened risk of earthquakes and nearby wildfires. We may not have adequate insurance, including business\ninterruption insurance, to compensate us for losses that may occur from any such significant events. A significant\nnatural disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire, or a public health crisis, such as a pandemic, or civil unrest could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, acts of\nterrorism or malicious computer viruses could cause disruptions in our or our solar partners’ businesses or the\neconomy as a whole. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of installations or the\ndeployment of our solar service offerings, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be\nadversely affected.\nChanges to the applicable laws and regulations governing direct-to-home sales and marketing may limit or\nrestrict our ability to effectively compete.\nWe utilize a direct-to-home sales model as a primary sales channel and are vulnerable to changes in laws\nand regulations related to direct sales and marketing that could impose additional limitations on unsolicited\nresidential sales calls and may impose additional restrictions such as adjustments to our marketing materials and\ndirect-selling processes, and new training for personnel. If additional laws and regulations affecting direct sales and\nmarketing are passed in the markets in which we operate, it would take time to train our sales professionals to\ncomply with such laws, and we may be exposed to fines or other penalties for violations of such laws. If we fail to\ncompete effectively through our direct-selling efforts, our financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects could be adversely affected.\nExpanding and maintaining new sales channels and affiliate channel partner networks could be costly and\ntime-consuming. As we enter new channels and establish new partnerships, we could be at a disadvantage\nrelative to other companies who have more history in these spaces.\nAs we continue to grow and expand our sales channels and affiliate channel partner networks, we may\nencounter challenges and additional costs.\nWith respect to developing our sales channels, such as direct-to-home, homebuilder, retail, and e-commerce\nchannels and adapting to a remote selling model, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs. In\naddition, we may not initially or ever be successful in utilizing these new channels. Furthermore, we may not be able\nto compete successfully with companies with a historical presence in such channels, and we may not realize the\nanticipated benefits of entering such channels, including efficiently increasing our customer base and ultimately\nreducing costs. Entering new channels also poses the risk of conflicts between sales channels. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully compete in new channels, our operating results and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or expand our affiliate channel partner relationships, we may be unable to adequately\nmeet anticipated demand for our solar service offerings, or we may only be able to offer our systems at higher costs\nor after delays. Further, if the terms, including geographic scope, exclusivity, pricing, duration, or other key terms of\nour agreements with our solar partners are substantially altered, it may impact our operational results and financial\nperformance.\nObtaining a sales contract with a potential customer does not guarantee that the potential customer will not\ndecide to cancel or that we will not need to cancel due to a failed inspection, which could cause us to\ngenerate no revenue despite incurring costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEven after we secure a sales contract with a potential customer, we (either directly or through our solar\npartners) must perform an inspection to ensure the home, including the rooftop, meets our standards and\nspecifications. If the inspection finds repairs to the rooftop are required in order to satisfy our standards and\nspecifications to install the solar energy system, and a potential customer does not want to make such required\nrepairs, we would lose that anticipated sale. In addition, per the terms of our Customer Agreements, a customer\nmaintains the ability to cancel before commencement of installation, subject to certain conditions. Any delay or\ncancellation of an anticipated sale could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have\nincurred sales-related, design-related, and other expenses and generated no revenue.\n28\nThe value of our solar energy systems at the end of the associated term of the lease or PPA may be lower\nthan projected, which may adversely affect our financial performance and valuation.\nWe depreciate the costs of our solar energy systems over their estimated useful life of 35 years. At the end of\nthe initial typically 20- or 25-year term of the Customer Agreement, customers may choose to purchase their solar\nenergy systems, ask to remove the system at our cost or renew their Customer Agreements. Customers may\nchoose to not renew or purchase for any reason, including pricing, decreased energy consumption, relocation of\nresidence, or switching to a competitor product.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to predict how future environmental regulations may affect the costs associated with\nthe removal, disposal or recycling of our solar energy systems. If the value in trade or renewal revenue is less than\nwe expect, we may be required to recognize all or some of the remaining unamortized costs. This could materially\nimpair our future results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of customers and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivables.\nOur Customer Agreements are typically for 20 or 25 years and require the customer to make monthly\npayments to us. Accordingly, we are subject to the credit risk of customers. As of December 31, 2023, the average\nFICO score of our customers under a Customer Agreement with a monthly payment schedule remained at or above\n740, which is generally categorized as a “Very Good” credit profile by the Fair Isaac Corporation. However, this may\ndecline to the extent FICO score requirements under future investment funds are relaxed. While customer defaults\nhave been immaterial to date, we expect that the risk of customer defaults may increase as we grow our business.\nDue to the immaterial amount of customer defaults to date, our reserve for this exposure is minimal, and our future\nexposure may exceed the amount of such reserves. If we experience increased customer credit defaults, our\nrevenue and our ability to raise new investment funds could be adversely affected. If economic conditions worsen,\ncertain of our customers may face liquidity concerns and may be unable to satisfy their payment obligations to us on\na timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or\nacquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe have in the past and may in the future, acquire companies, Project pipelines, Projects, SRECs, products,\nor technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions. For example, we completed the\nacquisition of Vivint Solar on October 8, 2020. Also, in July 2020, we announced a venture with SK E&S Co., Ltd.\nand other affiliated companies focused on home electrification. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past\nor future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and these transactions involve numerous risks that are\nnot within our control. These risks include the following, among others:\n• failure to satisfy the required conditions and otherwise complete a planned acquisition, joint venture or other\nstrategic transaction on a timely basis or at all;\n• legal or regulatory proceedings, if any, relating to a planned acquisition, joint venture or other strategic\ntransaction and the outcome of such legal proceedings;\n• difficulty in assimilating the operations, systems, and personnel of the acquired company, especially given\nour unique culture;\n• difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and\ntechnologies;\n• difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n29\n• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other\nopportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n• difficulty integrating the acquired company’s accounting, management information and other administrative\nsystems;\n• inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n• inability to retain key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n• incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our\nresults of operations;\n• significant post-acquisition investments which may lower the actual benefits realized through the\nacquisition;\n• potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal, and\nfinancial liabilities, among other things;\n• moderating and anticipating the impacts of inherent or emerging seasonality in acquired customer\nagreements;\n• potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and\n• potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which\ncould delay or prevent such acquisitions.\nOur failure to address these risks, or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future\ninvestments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these\nacquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future\nacquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent\nliabilities, amortization expenses, incremental expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our\nfinancial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nFrom time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of previously installed solar systems to further expand future\nsolar and storage upsell and retrofit opportunities. While we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material\nportion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions opportunistically. We may not realize\nthe anticipated benefits of such transactions, and these transactions involve numerous risks that are not within our\ncontrol.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, may not produce the anticipated benefits and could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining our proprietary technology, including our BrightPath\nsoftware, our ability to attract and retain solar partners could be impaired, our competitive position could\nbe harmed and our revenue could be reduced.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain our proprietary technology that\nsupports our solar service offerings, including our design and proposal software, BrightPath. In addition, we rely,\nand expect to continue to rely, on licensing agreements with certain third parties for aerial images that allow us to\nefficiently and effectively analyze a customer’s rooftop for solar energy system specifications. In the event that our\n30\ncurrent or future products require features that we have not developed or licensed, or we lose the benefit of an\nexisting license, we will be required to develop or obtain such technology through purchase, license or other\narrangements. If the required technology is not available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may incur\nadditional expenses in an effort to internally develop the required technology. In addition, our BrightPath software\nwas developed, in part, with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S.\ngovernment funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license\nauthorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the\ngovernment to disclose certain confidential information related to BrightPath to third parties and to exercise “march-\nin” rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. We are also subject to certain reporting and\nother obligations to the U.S. government in connection with funding for BrightPath. If we are unable to maintain our\nexisting proprietary technology, our ability to attract and retain solar partners could be impaired, our competitive\nposition could be harmed and our revenue could be reduced.\nDisruptions to our solar production metering solution could negatively impact our revenue and increase\nour expenses.\nOur ability to monitor solar energy production for various purposes depends on the operation of our metering\nsolution. We could incur significant expense and disruption to our operations in connection with failures of our\nmetering solution, including meter hardware failures and failure or obsolescence of the cellular technology that we\nuse to communicate with those meters. For example, many of our meters operate on either the 3G or 4G cellular\ndata networks, which are expected to sunset before the term of our Customer Agreements, and newer technologies\nwe use today may become obsolete before the end of the term of Customer Agreements entered into now.\nUpgrading our metering solution may cause us to incur significant expense. Additionally, our meters communicate\ndata through proprietary software, which we license from our metering partners. Should we be unable to continue to\nlicense, on agreeable terms, the software necessary to communicate with our meters, it could cause a significant\ndisruption in our business and operations.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and performance\nguarantee expenses, may lower the residual value of our solar energy systems and may damage our market\nreputation and cause our financial results to decline.\nCustomers who enter into Customer Agreements with us are covered by production guarantees and roof\npenetration warranties. As the owners of the solar energy systems, we or our investment funds receive a warranty\nfrom the inverter and solar panel manufacturers, and, for those solar energy systems that we do not install directly,\nwe receive workmanship and material warranties as well as roof penetration warranties from our solar partners.\nFurthermore, one or more of our third-party manufacturers or solar partners could cease operations and no longer\nhonor these warranties, leaving us to fulfill these potential obligations to customers, or such warranties may be\nlimited in scope and amount, and may be inadequate to protect us. We also provide a performance guarantee with\ncertain solar service offerings pursuant to which we compensate customers on an annual basis if their system does\nnot meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their agreement with us. Customers who enter into\nCustomer Agreements with us are covered by production guarantees equal to the length of the term of these\nagreements, typically 20 or 25 years. We may suffer financial losses associated if significant performance guarantee\npayments are triggered.\nBecause of our limited operating history and the length of the term of our Customer Agreements, we have\nbeen required to make assumptions and apply judgments regarding a number of factors, including our anticipated\nrate of warranty claims and the durability, performance and reliability of our solar energy systems. Our assumptions\ncould prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems, causing us to incur substantial\nexpense to repair or replace defective solar energy systems in the future or to compensate customers for systems\nthat do not meet their production guarantees. Product failures or operational deficiencies also would reduce our\nrevenue from power purchase or lease agreements because they are dependent on system production. Any\nwidespread product failures or operating deficiencies may damage our market reputation and adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\nOur business may be harmed if we fail to properly protect our intellectual property, and we may also be\nrequired to defend against claims or indemnify others against claims that our intellectual property infringes\non the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n31\nWe believe that the success of our business depends in part on our proprietary technology, including our\nsoftware, information, processes and know-how. We rely on copyright, trade secret and patent protections to secure\nour intellectual property rights. Although we may incur substantial costs in protecting our technology, we cannot be\ncertain that we have adequately protected or will be able to adequately protect it, that our competitors will not be\nable to utilize our existing technology or develop similar technology independently, that the claims allowed with\nrespect to any patents held by us will be broad enough to protect our technology or that foreign intellectual property\nlaws will adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our patents provide\nus with a competitive advantage. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our\nintellectual property without our consent. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the\nexpenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. In the future,\nsome of our products could be alleged to infringe existing patents or other intellectual property of third parties, and\nwe cannot be certain that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. In addition, any future litigation required\nto enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to defend us or indemnify others against claimed\ninfringement of the rights of third parties could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe use “open source” software in our solutions, which may require that we release the source code of\ncertain software subject to open source licenses or introduce vulnerabilities into our software that could\nbecome exploitable and expose sensitive data, either of which could subject us to possible litigation or\nother actions that could adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize software that is licensed under so-called “open source,” “free” or other similar licenses. Open\nsource software is made available to the general public on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable\nlicense. We currently combine our proprietary software with open source software but not in a manner that we\nbelieve requires the release of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. However, our use of open\nsource software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software. Open source licensors\ngenerally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of\nthe code, which could introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited and lead to the loss of sensitive or protected\ndata. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,\nunder certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public.\nThis would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time.\nWe may also face claims alleging noncompliance with open source license terms or infringement or\nmisappropriation of proprietary software. These claims could result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly\nlicense or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which\nwould have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if the license terms for open\nsource software that we use change, we may be forced to re-engineer our solutions, incur additional costs or\ndiscontinue the use of these solutions if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. Few courts have\ninterpreted open source licenses, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could\nimpose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to use our proprietary software. We cannot guarantee\nthat we have incorporated or will incorporate open source software in our software in a manner that will not subject\nus to liability or in a manner that is consistent with our current policies and procedures.\nAny security breach, unauthorized access or disclosure, or theft of data, including personal information,\nwe, our third-party service providers, and suppliers gather, store, transmit, and use, or other hacking,\ncyber-attack, phishing attack, and unauthorized intrusions into or through our systems or those of our third\nparty service providers, could harm our reputation, subject us to claims, litigation, financial harm, and have\nan adverse impact on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we, our third-party providers upon which we rely, and our suppliers collect,\nreceive, store, transmit, process, and use proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including the personal\ninformation of customers, such as names, addresses, email addresses, credit information and other housing and\nenergy use information, as well as the personal information of our employees. Unauthorized disclosure of such\nproprietary, confidential, or sensitive data, including personal information, whether through a breach of our or those\nof our third-party service providers and suppliers systems by an unauthorized party, including, but not limited to\nhackers, threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, nation-state-supported actors, personnel theft or misuse of\ninformation, or otherwise, could harm our business. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to\nengage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction\nwith military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we, the third parties upon\nwhich we rely, and our customers may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory\n32\ncyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell\nand distribute our goods and services.\nIn addition, we, our third-party service providers upon which we rely, and our suppliers may be subject to a\nvariety of evolving threats, such as computer malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat\nintrusions), ransomware, malicious code (such as viruses or worms), social engineering (including through deep\nfakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), telecommunications\nfailures, natural disasters and extreme weather events, general hacking, and other similar threats. Cybersecurity\nincidents have become more prevalent, and could occur on our systems and those of our third parties in the future.\nOur team members who work remotely pose increased risks to our information technology systems and data,\nbecause many of them utilize less secure network connections outside our premises.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including\naffected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the\ndisclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. Inadvertent\ndisclosure of confidential data, such as personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to\nthis type of data in our possession, has resulted in, and could result in future claims or litigation arising from\ndamages suffered by those affected, government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties,\naudits, and inspections), additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, indemnification obligations, reputational\nharm, interruptions in our operations, financial loss, and other similar harms. In addition, we could incur significant\ncosts in complying with the multitude of federal, state and local laws, and applicable independent security control\nframeworks, regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. While we have implemented security\nmeasures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be\neffective. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of such information, unauthorized intrusion, or\nother cyberthreat could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers, interrupt\nour operations, and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process\nsensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information\nsecurity practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place.\nIf our third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse\nconsequences. While we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy\nor security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to\nrecover such award.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that\nlimitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our\ndata privacy and security obligations. While we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not\nbe sufficient to cover us against claims, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available\nto us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nWe are, and may become, subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and rules,\ncontractual obligations, industry standards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and\nsecurity. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could\nresult in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we process personal data and other sensitive information, including\nproprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, and sensitive third-party data. Our\ndata processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws,\nregulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual\nrequirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. Obligations related to data privacy and\nsecurity (and consumers’ data privacy expectations) are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and\ncreating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations,\nwhich may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations\nrequires us to devote significant resources, which may necessitate changes to our services, information\ntechnologies, systems, and practices, and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security\nlaws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws, and other\nsimilar laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) imposes various consumer\nconsent requirements and other restrictions on certain telemarketing activity and other communications with\n33\nconsumers by phone, fax, or text message, and violations of the TCPA violations can result in significant financial\npenalties, including penalties or criminal fines imposed by the Federal Communications Commission.\nIn the past few years, numerous U.S. states—including California, Colorado, and Connecticut —have\nenacted comprehensive data privacy and security laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,\nincluding providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their\npersonal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data,\nand to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-\nmaking. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services.\nCertain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive\ninformation. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the CCPA applies to\npersonal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires\nbusinesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of such individuals to exercise\ncertain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation and allows private\nlitigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. These developments further\ncomplicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us, the third parties upon whom we\nrely, and our customers.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and\nsecurity obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply\nwith such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties on which we\nrely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations,\nwe could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g.,\ninvestigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections), litigation (including class-action claims), additional reporting\nrequirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data.\nInformation technology systems are a critical component of our long-term competitive strategy, and if we\nfail to timely and responsibly implement, adopt, and innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological\ndevelopments, including the use of artificial intelligence, our ability to compete, financial condition, and\noperating results could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to compete effectively requires our continued investment in technology to ensure we provide\nongoing value to our current and potential customers and operate efficiently. However, there are many\nuncertainties in newly emerging technologies and if we are unable to integrate and introduce new technologies,\nproducts, and services effectively, our ability to compete may be adversely affected and our business could be\nmaterially harmed.\nWhether we compete effectively may also be impacted by our ability to accurately anticipate and effectively\nrespond to the risks and opportunities presented by the disruptions and developments of emerging and newly\navailable technologies, including artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). We may not be successful in anticipating or responding\nto these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and if the rate at which we adopt and the ways in which\nwe apply new technologies lags or differs negatively in meaningful ways from our competitors, our business could\nbe adversely affected.\nIn particular, generative AI and other new and emerging technologies present a number of inherent risks and\nincorporating them into our information technology infrastructure, products, and services responsibly is crucial to\nmaintaining and strengthening our competitive position in the market. For example, AI technologies may create\nunintended biases, accuracy issues, and discriminatory outcomes that could lead to errors in our decision-making,\nproduct development or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating\nresults and financial condition. Further, the unauthorized use of AI technologies by our employees, third-party\nproviders, or our suppliers pose additional risks relating to data privacy and security, including the potential\nexposure of our confidential information to unauthorized recipients. Use of AI tools could result in future claims or\nlitigation related to unauthorized access to or use of confidential information and failure to comply with open source\nsoftware requirements.\nDamage to our brand and reputation or failure to expand our brand would harm our business and results of\noperations.\n34\nWe depend significantly on our brand and reputation for high-quality solar service offerings, engineering and\ncustomer service to attract customers and grow our business. If we fail to continue to deliver our solar service\nofferings within the planned timelines, if our solar service offerings do not perform as anticipated or if we damage\nany customers’ properties or cancel Projects, our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired. We also\ndepend greatly on referrals from customers for our growth. Therefore, our inability to meet or exceed customers’\nexpectations would harm our reputation and growth through referrals. We have at times focused particular attention\non expeditiously growing our direct sales force and our solar partners, leading us in some instances to hire\npersonnel or partner with third parties who we may later determine do not fit our company culture and standards.\nGiven the sheer volume of interactions our direct sales force and our solar partners have with customers and\npotential customers, it is also unavoidable that some interactions will be perceived by customers and potential\ncustomers as less than satisfactory and result in complaints. If we cannot manage our hiring and training processes\nto limit potential issues and maintain appropriate customer service levels, our brand and reputation may be harmed\nand our ability to grow our business would suffer. In addition, if we were unable to achieve a similar level of brand\nrecognition as our competitors, some of which may have a broader brand footprint, more resources and longer\noperational history, we could lose recognition in the marketplace among prospective customers, suppliers and\npartners, which could affect our growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy involves marketing and\nbranding initiatives that will involve incurring significant expenses in advance of corresponding revenue. We cannot\nassure you that such marketing and branding expenses will result in the successful expansion of our brand\nrecognition or increase our revenue. We are also subject to marketing and advertising regulations in various\njurisdictions, and overly restrictive conditions on our marketing and advertising activities may inhibit the sales of the\naffected products.\nA failure to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees and service providers in key functions would\nconstrain our growth and our ability to timely complete customers’ projects and successfully manage\ncustomer accounts.\nTo support our growth, we need to hire, train, deploy, manage and retain a substantial number of skilled\nemployees, engineers, installers, electricians, sales and project finance specialists. Competition for qualified\npersonnel in our industry is increasing, particularly for skilled personnel involved in the installation of solar energy\nsystems. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to attract or retain qualified and skilled\ninstallation personnel or installation companies to be our solar partners, which would have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness. We and our solar partners also compete with the homebuilding and construction industries for skilled\nlabor. As these industries grow and seek to hire additional workers, our cost of labor may increase. The unionization\nof the industry’s labor force could also increase our labor costs. Shortages of skilled labor could significantly delay a\nproject or otherwise increase our costs. Because our profit on a particular installation is based in part on\nassumptions as to the cost of such a project, cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may cause us to not\nachieve our expected margins or cover our costs for that project. In addition, because we are headquartered in the\nSan Francisco Bay Area, we compete for a limited pool of technical and engineering resources that requires us to\npay wages that are competitive with relatively high regional standards for employees in these fields. Further, we\nneed to continue to expand upon the training of our customer service team to provide high-end account\nmanagement and service to customers before, during and following the point of installation of our solar energy\nsystems. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and\nattention. It can take several months before a new customer service team member is fully trained and productive at\nthe standards that we have established. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented technical and customer\nservice personnel, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or grow our business.\nIn addition, to support the growth and success of our direct-to-consumer channel, we need to recruit, retain\nand motivate a large number of sales personnel on a continuing basis. We compete with many other companies for\nqualified sales personnel, and it could take many months before a new salesperson is fully trained on our solar\nservice offerings. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain qualified sales personnel or if they are unable to\nachieve desired productivity levels, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIf we or our solar partners cannot meet our hiring, retention and efficiency goals, we may be unable to\ncomplete customers’ Projects on time or manage customer accounts in an acceptable manner or at all. Any\nsignificant failures in this regard would materially impair our growth, reputation, business and financial results. If we\nare required to pay higher compensation than we anticipate, these greater expenses may also adversely impact our\nfinancial results and the growth of our business.\n35\nRegulators may limit the type of electricians qualified to install and service our solar and battery systems in\nCalifornia, which may result in workforce shortages, operational delays, and increased costs.\nIn June 2023, the CSLB initiated a formal rule proposal to allow solar installers (C-46 license holders) to\ncontinue to install energy storage systems less than 80 kWh when “incidental and supplemental” to the installation\nof a PV system, but would require the use of a C-10 license holder for repair and retrofit work. The proposed rule is\nsubject to notice and comment procedures and is still pending. The energy storage systems that we install in the\nresidential market typically do not exceed 80 kWh.\nWhile our workforce includes workers operating under both C-10 and C-46 licenses in California, there are\na limited number of C-10 certified electricians in the state, which may result in workforce shortages, operational\ndelays, and increased costs. Obtaining a C-10 license can be an extended process, and the timing and cost of\nhaving a large number of our C-46 licensed electricians seek such additional qualification is unclear.\nA significant portion of our customer base is in California, and as the state deals with growing wildfire risk\nand grid instability, an increasing number of our customers are choosing our solar and battery offerings. If we are\nunable to hire, develop and retain sufficient certified electricians, our growth of solar and battery customers in\nCalifornia may be significantly constrained, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nOur workforce has led the industry in safely installing solar and battery systems for tens of thousands of\ncustomers across the country, and we intend to work with regulators, industry partners, and stakeholders to grow\nthe solar and battery market throughout California.\nThe loss of one or more members of our senior management or key employees may adversely affect our\nability to implement our strategy.\nWe depend on our experienced management team, and the loss of one or more key executives could have\na negative impact on our business. With any change in leadership, there is a risk to organizational effectiveness and\nemployee retention as well as the potential for disruption to our business. None of our key executives or our key\nemployees are bound by employment agreements for any specific term, and we may be unable to replace key\nmembers of our management team and key employees in the event we lose their services. Integrating new\nemployees into our management team could prove disruptive to our operations, require substantial resources and\nmanagement attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful. An inability to attract and retain sufficient managerial\npersonnel who have critical industry experience and relationships could limit or delay our strategic efforts, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, regulatory inquiries and litigation, and we have previously been, and\nmay in the future be, named in additional legal proceedings, become involved in regulatory inquiries or be\nsubject to litigation in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business and could result in\nan unfavorable outcome, or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, or the trading price for our securities.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from government and regulatory agencies from\ntime to time. In the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a\nregulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could result in any\nnumber of outcomes. Although outcomes of such actions vary, any current or future claims or regulatory actions\ninitiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in significant costs, costly damage awards or\nsettlement amounts, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business\npractices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nIf we are not successful in our legal proceedings and litigation, we may be required to pay significant\nmonetary damages, which could hurt our results of operations. Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to\nresolve and divert management’s time and attention. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance\nmay not cover potential claims or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We\ncannot predict how the courts will rule in any potential lawsuit against us. Decisions in favor of parties that bring\nlawsuits against us could subject us to significant liability for damages, adversely affect our results of operations and\nharm our reputation.\n36\nA failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective\nresidential customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely\naffect our financial performance.\nOur business involves transactions with customers. We and our solar partners must comply with numerous\nfederal, state and local laws and regulations that govern matters relating to our interactions with customers,\nincluding those pertaining to data privacy and security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home\nimprovement contracts, warranties and direct-to-home solicitation, along with certain rules and regulations specific\nto the marketing and sale of residential solar products and services. These laws and regulations are dynamic and\nsubject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies\nmay expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes in\nthese laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we do business, acquire customers,\nand manage and use information we collect from and about current and prospective customers and the costs\nassociated therewith. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our interactions with\nresidential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner\nthat is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nNoncompliance with any such laws or regulations, or the perception that we or our solar partners have violated such\nlaws or regulations or engaged in deceptive practices that could result in a violation, could also expose us to claims,\nproceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines\nand negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We have incurred, and will\ncontinue to incur, significant expenses to comply with such laws and regulations, and increased regulation of\nmatters relating to our interactions with residential customers could require us to modify our operations and incur\nsignificant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nAny investigations, actions, adoption or amendment of regulations relating to the marketing of our products to\nresidential consumers could divert management’s attention from our business, require us to modify our operations\nand incur significant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations or could reduce the number of our potential customers.\nWe cannot ensure that our sales professionals and other personnel will always comply with our standard\npractices and policies, as well as applicable laws and regulations. In any of the numerous interactions between our\nsales professionals or other personnel and our customers or potential customers, our sales professionals or other\npersonnel may, without our knowledge and despite our efforts to effectively train them and enforce compliance,\nengage in conduct that is or may be prohibited under our standard practices and policies and applicable laws and\nregulations. Any such non-compliance, or the perception of non-compliance, has exposed us to claims and could\nexpose us to additional claims, proceedings, litigation, investigations, or enforcement actions by private parties or\nregulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and\nadversely affect our business and reputation. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to\ncomply with the laws, regulations and industry standards that apply to us.\nCompliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and\nnoncompliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant penalties, operational delays\nand adverse publicity.\nThe installation of solar energy systems requires our employees and employees of our solar partners to work\nwith complicated and potentially dangerous electrical and utility systems. The evaluation and installation of our\nenergy-related products also require these employees to work in locations that may contain potentially dangerous\nlevels of asbestos, lead or mold or other substances. We also maintain large fleets of vehicles that these employees\nuse in the course of their work. There is substantial risk of serious illness, injury, or death if proper safety procedures\nare not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation under OSHA and equivalent state laws. Changes to OSHA\nrequirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased costs.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious illness, injury, or death occurs,\nwe may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant\ncapital expenditures, or suspend or limit operations. Any accidents, citations, violations, illnesses, injuries or failure\nto comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive\nposition and adversely affect our business.\n37\nIf our products do not work as well as planned or if we are unsuccessful in developing and selling new\nproducts or in penetrating new markets, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on the products that we have developed or may develop\nin the future. There is a risk that the products that we have developed or may develop may not work as intended, or\nthat the marketing of the products may not be as successful as anticipated. The development of new products\ngenerally requires substantial investment and can require long development and testing periods before they are\ncommercially viable. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and it is\npossible that we may not develop or acquire new products or product enhancements that compete effectively within\nour target markets or differentiate our products based on functionality, performance or cost and thus our new\ntechnologies and products may not result in meaningful revenue. In addition, any delays in developing and releasing\nnew or enhanced products could cause us to lose revenue opportunities and potential customers. Any technical\nflaws in product releases could diminish the innovative impact of our products and have a negative effect on\ncustomer adoption and our reputation. If we fail to introduce new products that meet the demands of our customers\nor target markets or do not achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to penetrate new markets, our business,\nfinancial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred losses and may be unable to sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur net losses as we increase our spending to\nfinance the expansion of our operations, expand our installation, engineering, administrative, sales and marketing\nstaffs, increase spending on our brand awareness and other sales and marketing initiatives, make significant\ninvestments to drive future growth in our business and implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our\ngrowth. We do not know whether our revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited\noperating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of\noperations. Our ability to sustain profitability depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• growing our customer base;\n• reducing our operating costs by lowering our customer acquisition costs and optimizing our design and\ninstallation processes and supply chain logistics;\n• finding investors willing to invest in our investment funds on favorable terms;\n• maintaining or further lowering our cost of capital;\n• reducing the cost of components for our solar service offerings;\n• growing and maintaining our affiliate channel partner network;\n• maintaining high levels of product quality, performance, and customer satisfaction; and\n• growing our direct-to-consumer business to scale.\nEven if we do sustain profitability, we may be unable to achieve positive cash flows from operations in the\nfuture.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance\ndifficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below\nexpectations, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future. We have\nexperienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past and expect these fluctuations to continue. However,\n38\ngiven that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry, those fluctuations may be masked by our recent growth\nrates and thus may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations. As such, our past quarterly\nresults of operations may not be good indicators of likely future performance.\nIn addition to the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, as well as the factors discussed in the\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section, the following\nfactors, among others, could cause our results of operations and key performance indicators to fluctuate:\n• the expiration, reduction or initiation of any governmental tax rebates, tax exemptions, or incentives;\n• significant fluctuations in customer demand for our solar service offerings or fluctuations in the geographic\nconcentration of installations of solar energy systems;\n• changes in financial markets, which could restrict our ability to access available and cost-effective financing\nsources;\n• seasonal, environmental or weather conditions that impact sales, energy production, and system\ninstallations;\n• the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business,\noperations and infrastructure;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services, significant acquisitions, strategic\npartnerships, joint ventures, or capital-raising activities or commitments;\n• changes in our pricing policies or terms or those of our competitors, including utilities;\n• changes in regulatory policy related to solar energy generation;\n• the loss of one or more key partners or the failure of key partners to perform as anticipated;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate;\n• general economic, industry and market conditions beyond our control, such as bank failures, the COVID-19\npandemic, inflationary pressures, other macroeconomic factors, and associated economic downturn; and\n• changes to our cancellation rate.\nIn the past, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in sales and installations, particularly in the fourth\nquarter. This has been the result of decreased sales through the holiday season and weather-related installation\ndelays. Our incentives revenue is also highly variable due to associated revenue recognition rules, as discussed in\ngreater detail in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Seasonal\nand other factors may also contribute to variability in our sales of solar energy systems and product sales. For these\nor other reasons, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our\nfuture performance. In addition, our actual revenue or key operating metrics in one or more future quarters may fall\nshort of the expectations of investors and financial analysts. If that occurs, the trading price of our common stock\ncould decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nOur actual financial results may differ materially from any guidance we may publish from time to time.\n39\nWe have in the past provided, and may from time to time provide, guidance regarding our future performance\nthat represents our management’s estimates as of the date such guidance is provided. Any such guidance is based\nupon a number of assumptions with respect to future business decisions (some of which may change) and\nestimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic,\nand competitive uncertainties and contingencies (many of which are beyond our control, including those related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflict, bank failures, other macroeconomic factors,\nand associated economic downturn). Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that\nsome or all of the assumptions that inform such guidance will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual\nresults. Our ability to meet deployment volume, cost, net present value or any other forward-looking guidance is\nimpacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the number of our solar energy systems purchased\noutright versus the number of our solar energy systems that are subject to long-term Customer Agreements,\nchanges in installation costs, the availability of additional financing on acceptable terms, changes in the retail prices\nof traditional utility generated electricity, the availability of rebates, tax credits and other incentives, changes in\npolicies and regulations including net metering and interconnection limits or caps, the availability of solar panels and\nother raw materials, as well as the other risks to our business that are described in this section. Accordingly, our\nguidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date such guidance is provided.\nActual results may vary from such guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize\nthat the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light\nof the foregoing, investors should not place undue reliance on our financial guidance, and should carefully consider\nany guidance we may publish in context.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and\naffect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and officers.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq\nStock Market and other applicable rules and regulations, including, among other requirements, U.S. laws regarding\nrequirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin and existence of certain “conflict minerals.” Compliance with\nthese rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more\ndifficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act\nrequires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and\nresults of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial\nreporting. Maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting in\naccordance with this standard requires significant resources and management oversight. As a result, management’s\nattention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nAlthough we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more\nemployees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to Taxes and Accounting\nOur ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in\npart on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\nOur solar service offerings have been eligible for federal investment tax credits, U.S. Treasury grants, and\nother tax benefits. We have relied on, and will continue to rely on, tax equity investment funds, which are financing\nstructures that monetize a substantial portion of those benefits, in order to finance our solar service offerings. If, for\nany reason, we are unable to continue to monetize those benefits through these arrangements, we may be unable\nto provide and maintain our solar service offerings for customers on an economically viable basis.\nThe availability of this tax-advantaged financing depends upon many factors, including:\n• our ability to compete with other solar energy companies for the limited number of potential fund investors,\neach of which has limited funds and limited appetite for the tax benefits associated with these financings;\n• the state of financial and credit markets;\n• changes in the legal or tax risks associated with these financings; and\n40\n• legislative or regulatory changes or decreases to these incentives, including forthcoming final regulations\nfrom the U.S. Treasury regarding the Section 48 investment tax credit and the “tech-neutral” Section 48E\nClean Electricity Investment Tax Credit.\nThe federal government currently offers a Commercial ITC under Section 48(a) of the Code, for the\ninstallation of certain energy properties, including solar power and storage facilities owned for business purposes.\nThe Commercial ITC was extended and expanded upon by the IRA, which was signed into law by President Biden\non August 16, 2022. The IRA also created several ITC “bonus credits” to further incentivize various types of solar\nand storage facilities.\nOur inability to operationalize these tax credits, avail ourselves of IRA benefits in a timely fashion, or ensure\nthe facilities we intend to qualify under the ITC bonus credits satisfy the applicable requirements could impact our\nability to compete, and compromise or eliminate opportunities to financially benefit from these tax credits, which\nwould adversely impact our business. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is in various stages of issuing guidance\non the ITC bonus credits. On August 10, 2023, the Treasury issued a final rule for the Low-Income Communities\nBonus Credit Program under Section 48(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is currently reviewing applications\nfor it, along with the U.S. Department of Energy.\nIn addition, the U.S. Treasury issued initial guidance on the Energy Community Bonus Credit (Notice\n2023-29) on April 4, 2023, followed by additional guidance on June 15, 2023 (Notice 2023-47). Finally, the U.S.\nTreasury issued guidance on the Domestic Content Bonus Credit (Notice 2023-38) on May 12, 2023. Our ability to\nuse this bonus credit will depend in part on the extent to which our equipment suppliers and financing partners have\nconfidence in the potentially burdensome, complicated regulations.\nForthcoming further regulations and guidance on the ITC bonus credits and allocation process will be\nnecessary to determine whether, to what extent, and when we may benefit from the bonus credits, and our ability to\nincorporate them into our business operations, which will be further impacted by when the U.S. Treasury\npromulgates additional guidance and the official regulations. The U.S. Treasury is expected to issue final rules on\nthe Energy Communities Bonus Credit and the Domestic Content Bonus Credit in 2024 or early 2025.\nThe federal government also currently offers a Residential Clean Energy Credit, for the installation of\ncertain solar power facilities owned by residential taxpayers, which is applicable to customers who purchase a solar\nenergy system outright as opposed to entering into a Customer Agreement.\nWe and our tax equity partners have claimed and expect to continue to claim ITCs with respect to\nqualifying solar energy projects. However, the application of law and guidance regarding ITC eligibility to the facts of\nparticular solar energy projects is subject to a number of uncertainties, in particular with respect to the new IRA\nprovisions for which U.S. Treasury regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) will continue to be forthcoming, and there\ncan be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our approach in the event of an audit. The U.S. Treasury is\nexpected to continue issuing Treasury Regulations and additional guidance with respect to the application of the\nnewly enacted IRA provisions, and the IRS and U.S. Treasury may modify existing guidance, possibly with\nretroactive effect. For example, on November 17, 2023 the U.S. Treasury published a Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (“NPRM”) titled “Definition of Energy Property and Rules Applicable to the Energy Credit,” which will\nupdate the rules and regulations of the Section 48 ITC. Any of the foregoing items could reduce the amount of ITCs\navailable to us and our tax equity partners. In this event, we could be required to indemnify tax equity partners for\ndisallowed ITCs, adjust the terms of future tax equity partnerships, or seek alternative sources of funding for solar\nenergy projects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nFuture reductions in the Commercial ITC and any further legislative reductions or changes to the\nCommercial ITC may impact the attractiveness of solar energy to certain tax equity investors and could potentially\nharm our business. Obtaining tax equity funding (and tax equity funding on advantageous terms) also may become\nmore challenging. Additionally, the benefits of the Commercial ITC have historically enhanced our ability to provide\ncompetitive pricing for customers. Reductions in, eliminations of or expirations of governmental incentives such as\nthe Residential Clean Energy Credit could reduce the number of customers who choose to purchase our solar\nenergy systems.\nAdditionally, potential investors must remain satisfied that the structures that we offer make the tax benefits\nassociated with solar energy systems available to these investors, which depends on the investors’ assessment of\n41\nthe tax law, the absence of any unfavorable interpretations of that law and the continued application of existing tax\nlaw and interpretations to our funding structures. Changes in existing law or interpretations of existing law by the\nIRS and/or the courts could reduce the willingness of investors to invest in funds associated with these solar energy\nsystems. Moreover, reductions to the corporate tax rate may reduce the appetite for tax benefits overall, which could\nreduce the pool of available funds. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that this type of financing will\ncontinue to be available to us. New investment fund structures or other financing mechanisms may become\navailable, but if we are unable to take advantage of these fund structures and financing mechanisms, we may be at\na competitive disadvantage. If, for any reason, we are unable to finance our solar service offerings through tax-\nadvantaged structures or if we are unable to realize or monetize Commercial ITCs or other tax benefits, we may no\nlonger be able to provide our solar service offerings to new customers on an economically viable basis, which would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nIf the IRS makes determinations that the creditable basis of our solar energy systems is materially lower\nthan what we have claimed, we may have to pay significant amounts to our fund investors, and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe and our fund investors claim the Commercial ITC in amounts based on the purchase price paid by our\nfunds for our solar energy systems (i.e., the funds’ basis in the solar energy systems, or creditable basis). Such\npurchase prices are based on the fair market value of our systems as determined pursuant to independent\nappraisals obtained by us. With respect to Commercial ITCs, the IRS may on audit determine that the creditable\nbasis for our solar energy systems is lower than the amount determined by the appraisal and accordingly argue that\nthe tax credits previously claimed must be reduced. If the creditable basis is determined in these circumstances to\nbe less than what we or our tax equity investment funds reported, we may owe our fund investors an amount equal\nto the amount by which the ITCs are reduced (including any interest and penalties), plus any costs and expenses\nassociated with a challenge to that valuation. We could also be subject to tax liabilities, including interest and\npenalties. If the IRS further disagrees now or in the future with the amounts we or our tax equity investment funds\nreported regarding the creditable or depreciable basis of our solar energy systems, it could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe have purchased insurance policies insuring us and related parties for additional taxes owed in respect of\nlost Commercial ITCs, depreciation, gross-up costs and expenses incurred in defending the types of claims\ndescribed above. However, these policies only cover certain investment funds and have negotiated exclusions from,\nand limitations to, coverage and therefore may not cover us for all such lost Commercial ITCs, taxes, costs and\nexpenses.\nThe IRS is auditing one of our investors in an audit involving a review of the fair market value determination\nof our solar energy systems in the investment fund, which is covered by our 2018 insurance policy. If this audit\nresults in an adverse final determination, we may be subject to an indemnity obligation to our investor, which may\nresult in certain limited out-of-pocket costs and potential increased insurance premiums in the future.\nOur business currently depends on the availability of utility rebates, tax credits and other benefits, tax\nexemptions and exclusions, and other financial incentives on the federal, state, and/or local levels. We may\nbe adversely affected by changes in, and application of, these laws or other incentives to us, and the\nexpiration, elimination or reduction of these benefits could adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on government policies that promote and support solar energy and enhance the\neconomic viability of owning solar energy systems. U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies provide\nincentives to owners, distributors, installers and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy.\nThese incentives include Commercial ITCs and Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit, as discussed above,\nas well as other tax credits, rebates and SRECs associated with solar energy generation. Some markets, such as\nNew Jersey and Maryland, currently utilize SRECs. SRECs can be volatile and their value could decrease over time\nas the supply of SREC-producing solar energy systems installed in a particular market increases. We rely on these\nincentives to lower our cost of capital and to attract investors, all of which enable us to lower the price we charge\ncustomers for our solar service offerings. These incentives have had a significant impact on the development of\nsolar energy but they could change at any time, especially after changes in the Administration or Congress. These\nincentives may also expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced,\nterminated or repealed without notice. The financial value of certain incentives may also decrease over time.\n42\nIn December 2017, significant federal tax legislation was enacted, including a change to the corporate tax\nrate (the “Tax Act”). As part of the Tax Act, the current corporate income tax rate was reduced, and there were other\nchanges including limiting or eliminating various other deductions, credits and tax preferences. This reduction in the\ncorporate income tax rate may have reduced appetite for the Commercial ITC and depreciation benefits available\nwith respect to solar facilities. The IRA implemented a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% of financial\nstatement income (subject to certain adjustments) for companies that report over $1 billion in profits to\nshareholders; similar to existing law, business credits (including Commercial ITCs) are limited to 75% of income in\nexcess of $25,000 (with no limit against the first $25,000). We cannot predict whether and to what extent the U.S.\ncorporate income tax rate will change under the Biden administration. The U.S. Congress is constantly considering\nchanges to the tax code. For example, on June 13, 2023, the House Ways & Means Committee passed legislation\n(H.R. 3938) that, if it became law, would eliminate the IRA’s Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit, which\nis scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2025. Further limitations on, or elimination of, the tax benefits that support\nthe financing of solar energy under current U.S. law could significantly impact our ability to raise tax equity\ninvestment funds or impact the terms thereof, including the amount of cash distributable to our investors. Similarly,\nany unfavorable interpretations of tax law by the IRS and/or the courts with respect to our financing structures could\nreduce the willingness of investors to invest in our funds associated with any such structure.\nAny effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations or policies that are supportive of solar energy\ngeneration or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of energy generation that compete with solar\nenergy projects could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business model also relies on multiple tax exemptions offered at the state and local levels. For example,\nsome states have property tax exemptions that exempt the value of solar energy systems in determining values for\ncalculation of local and state real and personal property taxes. State and local tax exemptions can have sunset\ndates, triggers for loss of the exemption, and can be changed by state legislatures and other regulators, and if solar\nenergy systems were not exempt from such taxes, the property taxes payable by customers would be higher, which\ncould offset any potential savings our solar service offerings could offer. Similarly, if state or local legislatures or tax\nadministrators impose property taxes on third-party owners of solar energy systems, solar companies like us would\nbe subject to higher costs. California provides an exclusion (the “Solar Exclusion”) from the assessment of\nCalifornia property taxes for qualifying “active solar energy systems” installed as fixtures before January 1, 2027,\nprovided such systems are locally rather than centrally assessed (“Eligible Property”). However, the Solar Exclusion\nis not a permanent exclusion from the assessment of property tax. Once a change in ownership of the Eligible\nProperty occurs, the Eligible Property may be subject to reassessment and California property taxes may become\ndue.\nIn general, we rely on certain state and local tax exemptions that apply to the sale of equipment, sale of\npower, or both. These state and local tax exemptions can expire, can be changed by state legislatures, or their\napplication to us can be challenged by regulators, tax administrators, or court rulings, and such changes could\nadversely impact our business and the profitability of our offerings in certain markets.\nWe may be subject to adverse California property tax consequences.\nThe State of California provides an exclusion (the “Solar Exclusion”) from the assessment of California\nproperty taxes for qualifying “active solar energy systems” installed as fixtures before January 1, 2027, provided\nsuch systems are locally rather than centrally assessed (“Eligible Property”). However, the Solar Exclusion is not a\npermanent exclusion from the assessment of property tax. Once a change in ownership of the Eligible Property\noccurs, the Eligible Property may be subject to reassessment and California property taxes may become due.\nVivint Solar, through certain of its subsidiaries, owns solar energy systems that constitute Eligible Property\n(the “California PV Systems”). To the extent Vivint Solar or its subsidiaries are considered the tax owners of the\nCalifornia PV Systems for purposes of the California Revenue and Tax Code, our acquisition of Vivint Solar may\nconstitute a change of control of the California PV Systems, triggering the loss of the Solar Exclusion and the\nimposition of California property taxes, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting,\ninvestors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and, as a result,\nthe value of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\n43\nWe are required, pursuant to the Exchange Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things,\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any\nmaterial weaknesses, if any, identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting. We are\ncontinuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and improve our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and\ncontinuously look for ways to enhance existing effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls\nover financial reporting. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions in our business, which presents additional complexities relating to the design and\nimplementation of our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we or our\nindependent accounting firm may identify weaknesses and deficiencies that we may not otherwise identify in a\ntimely manner in the future. If we are not able to complete the work required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act on a timely basis for future fiscal years, our annual report on Form 10-K may be delayed or deficient.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance\nthat misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be\ndetected.\nWe cannot guarantee that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and\nfraud. The risk of errors is increased in light of the complexity of our business and investment funds. For example,\nwe must deal with significant complexity in accounting for our fund structures and the resulting allocation of net\n(loss) income between our stockholders and noncontrolling interests under the hypothetical liquidation at book value\n(“HLBV”) method as well as the income tax consequences of these fund structures. As we enter into additional\ninvestment funds, which may have contractual provisions different from those of our existing funds, the analysis as\nto whether we consolidate these funds, the calculation under the HLBV method, and the analysis of the tax impact\ncould become increasingly complicated. This additional complexity could require us to hire additional resources and\nincrease the chance that we experience errors in the future.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective, we could lose\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our\ncommon stock to decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other\nregulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur reported financial results may be affected, and comparability of our financial results with other\ncompanies in our industry may be impacted, by changes in the accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to change and interpretation by\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB\"), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant\neffect on our reported financial results and on the financial results of other companies in our industry, and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Other\ncompanies in our industry may be affected differently by the adoption of new accounting standards, including timing\nof the adoption of new accounting standards, adversely affecting the comparability of financial statements.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of\napproximately $720.7 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, which begin expiring in varying amounts in 2028 and\n2024, respectively, if unused. Our U.S. federal and certain state NOLs generated in tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017 total approximately $2.0 billion and $357.1 million, respectively, have indefinite carryover\nperiods, and do not expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership\nchange,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax assets, such as tax credits,\nto offset its post change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a\ncumulative change in our ownership by “5% stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-\nyear period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Additionally, states may impose other limitations on the\nuse of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. Any such limitations on our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets\ncould adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have performed an analysis\n44\nto determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code had occurred and determined no\nownership changes were identified as of December 31, 2023.\nWe may be required to record an impairment expense on our goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least\nannually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and to\nreview our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable. Factors that can lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant\nadverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results, declines in the financial condition\nof our business and sustained decrease in our stock price. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed an\ninterim quantitative assessment as of September 30, 2023 related to the recoverability of our goodwill for our one\nreporting unit as a result of a material sustained decline in our stock price. We concluded that the fair value of our\none reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value as of September 30, 2023 and recorded an impairment of $1.2\nbillion in our consolidated statements of operations. As of October 1, 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill\nimpairment test. The test concluded that no additional impairment had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIt is possible that we could recognize further goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other\nfactors:\n• there are further sustained declines in our stock price\n• valuations for comparable companies or comparable acquisitions valuations deteriorate\nthe cost of equity or debt capital increases; or\n• the outlook for future cash flows for our reporting unit deteriorate including but not limited to, increased\ncompetition, changes to discount rate, downward forecast revisions, restricting plans or changes in state\nand federal regulations affecting our business.\nFor further information regarding the assessment please see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders continue to have substantial control over us,\nwhich will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important matters, including a change in control.\nOur executive officers, directors and each of our stockholders who beneficially own 5% or more of our\noutstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 33.7% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023. As\na result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our\nstockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary\ntransactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree\nand which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying or preventing\na change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their\ncapital stock and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or\npart of your investment in our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering, and is likely to\ncontinue to be volatile. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the\nfollowing:\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n45\n• volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of companies in our industry or companies that investors\nconsider comparable;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\n• sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities\nanalysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to\nmeet those projections;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations;\n• changes in tax and other incentives that we rely upon in order to raise tax equity investment funds;\n• actual or perceived data privacy or security incidents;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights;\n• changes in the regulatory environment and utility policies and pricing, including those that could reduce any\nsavings we are able to offer to customers;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive\nlandscape generally;\n• litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our\ncompetitors;\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n• major catastrophic events, global armed conflicts or civil unrest;\n• negative publicity, including accurate or inaccurate commentary or reports regarding us, our products, our\nsales professionals or other personnel, or other third parties affiliated with us, on social media platforms,\nblogs, and other websites;\n46\n• any significant change in our management; and\n• general economic conditions including instability in financial markets and bank failures, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets.\nFurther, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue\nto affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the stock prices of many renewable\nenergy companies have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of\nthose companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market\nconditions such as recessions, government shutdowns, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations,\nhas, and may continue to, cause the trading price of the notes and our common stock to decline. In the past,\nfollowing periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities,\nsecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. We are party to litigation that\ncould result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including by our\nexisting stockholders, could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that\nthese sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise\ncapital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that these sales and\nothers may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders, including SK E&S Co., Ltd. and other affiliated companies as well as\ncertain stockholders who received shares as a result of our acquisition of Vivint Solar, have registration rights that\nwould require us to register shares of our capital stock owned by them for public sale in the United States. We have\nalso filed a registration statement to register shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our\nequity compensation plans, including shares underlying equity awards assumed in connection with our acquisition\nof Vivint Solar. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that\napply to affiliates, the shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will become\navailable for immediate resale in the public market upon issuance.\nFuture sales of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the market price of our common stock\nto decline and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions\nthat could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by\nour board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. Among other things, our\nrestated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n• authorizing “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without\nstockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common\nstock;\n• limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n• limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n• requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our\nstockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and\n47\n• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or\nchanges in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the\nDelaware General Corporation law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding\ncapital stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of\nour outstanding capital stock not held by such stockholder. Any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation,\namended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control\ncould limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could\nalso affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws limit the\nability of our stockholders to call special meetings and prohibit stockholder action by written consent.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not take action by written\nconsent. Instead, any such actions must be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders. As a result,\nour stockholders are not able to take any action without first holding a meeting of our stockholders called in\naccordance with the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, including advance notice procedures set forth\nin our amended and restated bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that special meetings of our\nstockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our\nChief Executive Officer or our President. As a result, our stockholders are not allowed to call a special meeting.\nThese provisions may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal,\nincluding a proposal to remove directors.\nProvisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could\npreclude our stockholders from bringing matters before meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our\nboard of directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring\nbusiness before, or nominate candidates for election as directors at, our annual or special meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may remove directors only for cause.\nAny amendment of these provisions in our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation\nwould require approval by holders of a majority of our then outstanding capital stock. These provisions could\npreclude our stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay\nchanges in our board of directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware\nwill be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which\ncould limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum,\nthe sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our\nstockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or\nfederal court located within the state of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over\nthe indispensable parties names as defendants. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to\nbring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other\nemployees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. In\naddition, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the\nsole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities\nAct. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be\n48\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in\nother jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, our market\nor our competitors, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, the\nmarket price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry\nanalysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us\nadversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or provide more favorable\nrecommendations about our competitors, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If any of the\nanalysts who cover us cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose\nvisibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock and trading\nvolume to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future, so investors may need to rely on sales\nof our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur or only occur at certain times, as the\nonly way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, our credit agreements contain restrictions on payments of cash dividends. Consequently, investors may\nneed to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur or only occur at certain\ntimes, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not\npurchase shares of our common stock.\nAdditional issuances of our capital stock or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to our\nstockholders.\nWe may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, make acquisitions or for a variety of other\npurposes. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Vivint Solar, we issued 0.55 shares of our common\nstock for each share of Vivint Solar’s common stock owned prior to the acquisition, which resulted in dilution to our\nstockholders. Additional issuances of our capital stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or conversion of new\nor existing convertible debt securities (including the Notes), warrants, stock options or other equity incentive awards\nto new and existing service providers. Any such issuances will result in dilution to existing holders of our stock. We\nalso rely on equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining employees. The amount of\ndilution due to equity-based compensation of our employees and other additional issuances of our common stock or\nsecurities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could be substantial, and the\nmarket price of our common stock could decline.\nThe Capped Call transactions may negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into the Capped Call transactions with the option\ncounterparties. The Capped Call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common\nstock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the\nprincipal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or\nunwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or\nother securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so\nduring the observation period for conversions of Notes following November 1, 2025 or following any repurchase of\nNotes by us). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common\nstock.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will\ndepend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n49\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with\ncybersecurity threats. We have implemented cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our\nefforts to assess, identify, and manage such material risks.\nTo identify and assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, our enterprise risk management program\nconsiders cybersecurity threat risks alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process.\nOur enterprise risk professionals collaborate with subject matter specialists, as necessary, to gather insights for\nidentifying and assessing material cybersecurity risks, their severity, and potential mitigation strategies. We employ\nvarious tools and services for such purposes, including network, cloud and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability\nassessments, penetration testing, and tabletop exercises. We also have a cybersecurity risk assessment process,\nwhich helps identify our cybersecurity threat risks by considering certain industry standards as well as by engaging\nthird parties to assess the security posture of our information security program.\nTo manage our material risks from cybersecurity threats, we take certain measures, including the below listed\nactivities, depending on the nature of the relevant systems, data, and environment:\n• undertaking period reviews of our consumer-facing policies and statements;\n• conduct phishing email simulations for employees and contractors with access to corporate email systems;\n• require employees, and certain service providers, to treat customer information with care;\n• running tabletop exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident;\n• carrying cybersecurity insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a\ncybersecurity incident;\n• conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training for employees; and\n• maintaining an incident response plan to prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from, cybersecurity\nincidents.\nAs part of our efforts to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, we engage third-\nparty cybersecurity consultants and use them to, among other things, conduct a review of our cybersecurity\nprogram or conduct a tabletop exercise to help identify areas for continued focus, improvement and/or compliance.\nOur processes also address cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers,\nincluding those in our supply chain, which also include, but are not limited to, open-source software in our\napplication development processes, or those who have access to our customer and employee data or our systems.\nAddressing these risks is part of our enterprise risk management program. Cybersecurity risks affect the selection\nand oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform diligence on third-parties that have access to our\ncritical systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data, and monitor cybersecurity threat risks identified\nthrough such diligence. Additionally, we may impose contractual requirements related to cybersecurity on certain\nthird parties that could pose significant cybersecurity risk to us and require them to agree to audits as appropriate.\nWe describe the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us and how they may do so under\nthe heading “Risks Related to Our Business Operations” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which\ndisclosures are incorporated by reference herein.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of increasing focus for\nour Board and management. Our approach is to treat cybersecurity not just as a technology issue, but to recognize\nthat it can have wide-ranging impacts on the business, operations, and financials of our company.\n50\nOur Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and receives\nupdates from management quarterly. At least annually, the entire Board receives an overview from management of\nour cybersecurity threat risk management and strategy processes covering topics such as data security posture,\nresults from third-party assessments, progress towards pre-determined risk-mitigation-related goals, our incident\nresponse plan, and material cybersecurity threat risks or incidents and developments, as well as the steps\nmanagement has taken to respond to such risks. In such sessions, the Audit Committee and Board generally\nreceive materials including a cybersecurity scorecard and other materials indicating current and emerging material\ncybersecurity threat risks, and describing the company’s ability to mitigate those risks, and discuss such matters\nwith our Chief Information Security Officer. Members of the Board are also encouraged to regularly engage in ad\nhoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our\ncybersecurity risk management and strategy programs. Material cybersecurity threat risks are also considered\nduring separate Board meeting discussions of important matters like enterprise risk management, operational\nbudgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and acquisitions, brand management, and other relevant matters.\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above,\nare led by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in connection with our Chief Technology Officer, Chief Legal\nand People Officer, our Senior Vice President of Legal and Vice President, Internal Audit. Such individuals have\nextensive prior work experience and expertise spanning over three decades in various roles involving managing\ninformation security, developing cybersecurity strategy, implementing effective information and cybersecurity\nprograms, managing cybersecurity operations and incident response, and incorporating security and privacy by\ndesign into software development programs, and our CISO has both CISSP and CRISC certifications.\nThese members of management are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and\nremediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk\nmanagement and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.\nAs discussed above, these members of management report to the entire Board about cybersecurity threat\nrisks, among other cybersecurity related matters at least annually, with updates to the Audit Committee on a\nquarterly basis.\n51\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters and executive offices are located in San Francisco, California, where we lease\napproximately 44,000 square feet of office space. We also maintain 101 other locations, consisting primarily of\nbranch offices, warehouses, sales offices and design centers in 19 states.\nWe lease all of our facilities and we do not own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are\nadequate to meet our ongoing needs. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain\nadditional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.\nItem 3.

Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n52\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of\nEquity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “RUN” on August 5,\n2015.\nHolders of Record\nAs of February 16, 2024, there were approximately 429 holders of record of common stock. Certain shares\nare held in “street” name and, accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included\nin the foregoing number.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all\navailable funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any\ndividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made\nat the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general\nbusiness conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit\nagreements contain restrictions on payments of cash dividends.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued warrants exercisable for up to 846,943 shares of our\ncommon stock to certain strategic partners, calculated using the closing stock price for the respective stock grant’s\nquarter of issuance. The shares underlying the warrants will vest upon certain time- and performance-based criteria\nas set forth in the warrants. The exercise price of the warrants is $0.01 per share, and 63,742, 346,269 and 69,309\nwarrants were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe warrants were issued and sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of Section\n5 of the Securities Act, as they did not involve a public offering under Section 4(a)(2) and were issued as restricted\nsecurities pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nStock Price Performance Graph\nThe following stock performance graph compares our total stock return with the total return for (i) the Nasdaq\nComposite Index and the (ii) the Invesco Solar ETF, which represents a peer group of solar companies, for the\nperiod from December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2023. The figures represented below assume an investment\nof $100 in our common stock at the closing price of $10.89 on December 31, 2018 and in the Nasdaq Composite\nIndex and the Invesco Solar ETF on December 31, 2018 including the reinvestment of dividends into shares of\ncommon stock. The comparisons in the table are required by the SEC, and are not intended to forecast or be\nindicative of possible future performance of our common stock. This graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material”\nor be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that\nsection, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act,\nwhether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such\nfiling.\n53\nItem 6. [Reserved].\nNot applicable.\n54\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our\nactual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such\ndifferences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe provide clean, solar energy and energy storage to customers at a significant savings compared to\ntraditional utility energy. We have been selling solar energy to residential customers through a variety of offerings\nsince we were founded in 2007. We, either directly or through one of our solar partners, install a solar energy\nsystem on a customer’s home and either sell the system to the customer or, as is more often the case, sell the\nenergy generated by the system to the customer pursuant to a lease or PPA with no or low upfront costs. We refer\nto these leases and PPAs as “Customer Agreements.” Following installation, a system is interconnected to the local\nutility grid. The home’s energy usage is provided by the solar energy system, with any additional energy needs\nprovided by the local utility. Any excess solar energy, including amounts in excess of battery storage, that is not\nimmediately used by the customers is exported to the utility grid using a bi-directional utility net meter, and the\ncustomer generally receives a credit for the excess energy from their utility to offset future usage of utility-generated\nenergy.\nWe offer our solar service offerings both directly to the customer and through our solar partners, which\ninclude sales and installation partners, and strategic partners, which include retail partners. In addition, we sell solar\nenergy systems directly to customers for cash. We also sell solar energy panels and other products (such as\nracking) to resellers. As of December 31, 2023, we provided our solar services to customers and sold solar energy\npanels and other products to resellers throughout the United States. More than 45% of our cumulative systems\ndeployed are in California.\nWe compete mainly with traditional utilities. In the markets we serve, our strategy is to price the energy we\nsell below prevailing local retail electricity rates. As a result, the price our customers pay under our solar service\nofferings varies depending on the state where the customer lives, the local traditional utility that otherwise provides\nelectricity to the customer, as well as the prices other solar energy companies charge in that region. Even within the\nsame neighborhood, site-specific characteristics drive meaningful variability in the revenue and cost profiles of each\nhome. Using our proprietary technology, we target homes with advantageous revenue and cost characteristics,\nwhich means we are often able to offer pricing that allows customers to save more on their energy bill while\nmaintaining our ability to meet our targeted returns. For example, with the insights provided by our technology, we\ncan offer competitive pricing to customers with homes that have favorable characteristics, such as roofs that allow\nfor easy installation, high electricity consumption, or low shading, effectively passing through the cost savings we\nare able to achieve on these installations to the customer.\nOur ability to offer Customer Agreements depends in part on our ability to finance the purchase and\ninstallation of the solar energy systems by monetizing the resulting customer cash flows and related Commercial\nITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives from governments and local utilities. We monetize these\nincentives under tax equity investment funds, which are generally structured as non-recourse project financings.\nSince inception we have raised numerous tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy\nsystems. From time to time, we may repurchase investors' interests in our tax equity investment funds after the\nrecapture period of the relevant tax incentives. We intend to establish additional investment funds and may also use\ndebt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our growth.\nIn addition, completing the sale and installation of a solar energy system requires many different steps\nincluding a site audit, completion of designs, permitting, installation, electrical sign-off and interconnection.\nCustomers may cancel their Customer Agreements with us, subject to certain conditions, during this process until\ncommencement of installation. Customer cancellation rates can change over time and vary between markets.\nMarket & Macroeconomic Environment\n55\nOur business and financial performance also depend on worldwide economic conditions. We face global\nmacroeconomic challenges, particularly in light of increases and volatility in interest rates, uncertainty in markets,\ninflationary trends, navigating complex and evolving regulatory and tax frameworks, and the dynamics of the global\ntrade environment. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we observed market uncertainty,\nincreasing inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, the market impacts of proposed or newly enacted regulatory\nframeworks in markets within which we do business and within our industry, supply constraints, and bank failures. In\nparticular, rising interest rates, including recent historic increases starting in 2021, have resulted and may continue\nto result in a decrease in our advance rates, reducing the proceeds we receive from certain investment funds.\nBecause our financing structure is sensitive to volatility in interest rates, higher rates increase our cost of capital and\nmay decrease the amount of capital available to us to finance the deployment of new solar energy systems. These\nmarket dynamics, some of which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future, have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact our business and financial results.\nIn December 2022, California made changes to its net metering policy by adopting NBT, which presents a\nsignificant change to the rate structure for new California customers, and has partially limited the financial\nattractiveness of our offerings in certain regions of the state, particularly for solar-only systems. However, under this\nnew policy, the value proposition of storage offerings is significantly enhanced. We believe that California will be\npredominantly a solar plus storage market going forward and the vast majority of California sales now consist of\neither our Sunrun Shift product or our backup battery offerings. As the demand for solar plus storage offerings\ngrows, we anticipate facing additional operational challenges associated with the complexity of deploying storage\nsolutions. For example, solar plus storage offerings tend to have longer cycle times due to factors such as\nlengthened permitting and inspection times and potential need of a main panel upgrade. Any such factors that\nextend the timeframes from customer signature to installation have historically resulted in increased operational\nchallenges and correspondingly lower realization rates, and any future instances may continue to do so.\nAccordingly, this may adversely affect our financial performance, as well as the timing and magnitude of our\ninstallations and the recognition of the associated revenue.\nUnder the new NBT framework, the value proposition of our products is best understood when customers\ncompare the combined costs of their utility bill along with their Sunrun solar and storage bill, due to the impact of\ntime-of-use rates and export rates. The solar industry in California is adjusting from selling based on the value of\nsolar-only to a more complicated rate design with NBT. We believe the best customer offering is one that pairs solar\nand storage, although it may be more confusing to customers when compared to solar-only offers from competitors.\nThis dynamic may result in less sales efficacy so long as customers continue to be presented with inferior, but\nsimpler, solar-only offerings and as a result, may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nand may also harm the reputation of the solar industry in California at large.\nSince implementation of NBT, originations in California have continued to be below levels prior to the\ntransition for us and across the residential solar industry. Without further increases in originations, our new\ninstallations in California may continue to decline compared to prior periods, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business operations and financial performance.\nWe have also recently seen new market entrants paying significantly higher turnkey prices and sales\ncommissions than prevailing industry norms. Although we believe this to be an economically unsustainable practice,\nin the short term, it has contributed to increased competition in the industry.\nThe Opportunity of Home Electrification and a Clean, Resilient Grid\nThe United States is on the precipice of a once-in-a-generation transformation of our energy system. The\ndecarbonization of the American economy will require powering our energy supply, including our homes, appliances\nand automobiles, with clean energy. Sunrun’s next goal and chapter of growth is to be the go-to company for clean\nand reliable home electrification, providing our customers with affordable renewable energy throughout their homes\nand our communities with a cleaner, more resilient grid.\nWe intend to pursue these opportunities on a variety of fronts, and we continue to pursue the development\nof our grid services business, creating virtual power plants that lead to a cleaner, more resilient grid. In collaboration\nwith grid managers, we can deploy our battery systems where they will add the most value for utilities, the grid, and\ncustomers. We are actively delivering demand response and capacity services to meet operational needs in multiple\ngeographies, and partnering with grid managers to build a more resilient electricity system that integrates the new\nenergy technologies customers want.\n56\nWe believe the electrification of U.S. households with renewable energy, and the accompanying\ndevelopment of an inter-connected, smart grid will provide a number of market opportunities beyond our traditional\nsolar and battery storage offerings, including EV chargers, battery retrofits, re-powered or expanding systems,\nhome energy management services, and other home electrification products. Additionally, we believe our omni-\nchannel model and geographic reach provides us with the capabilities to execute on these opportunities in a variety\nof markets.\nTo further expand such future upsell and retrofit opportunities, from time to time, we may pursue\nacquisitions of previously installed solar systems. While we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material\nportion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions opportunistically. For instance, in the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed a strategic transaction that added approximately 2,000 Customers and 13\nMW of Networked Solar Energy Capacity.\nIn sum, we believe the electrification of the U.S. economy with renewable energy presents an\nunprecedented economic opportunity, as well as our country’s best path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\nThrough these electrification opportunities and our grid services business, we aim to be the consumer brand\nsynonymous with repowering our customers’ homes with renewable energy and providing a pathway to a cleaner,\nhealthier future.\nInvestment Funds\nOur Customer Agreements provide for recurring customer payments, typically over 20 or 25 years, and the\nrelated solar energy systems are generally eligible for Commercial ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other\ngovernment or utility incentives. Our financing strategy is to monetize these benefits at a low weighted average cost\nof capital. This low cost of capital enables us to offer attractive pricing to our customers for the energy generated by\nthe solar energy system on their homes. Historically, we have monetized a portion of the value created by our\nCustomer Agreements and the related solar energy systems through investment funds. These assets are attractive\nto fund investors due to the long-term, recurring nature of the cash flows generated by our Customer Agreements,\nthe high credit scores of our customers, the fact that energy is a non-discretionary good and our low loss rates. In\naddition, fund investors can receive attractive after-tax returns from our investment funds due to their ability to utilize\nCommercial ITCs, accelerated depreciation and certain government or utility incentives associated with the funds’\nownership of solar energy systems.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 64 active investment funds, which are described below. We have\nestablished different types of investment funds to implement our asset monetization strategy. Depending on the\nnature of the investment fund, cash may be contributed to the investment fund by the investor upfront or in stages\nbased on milestones associated with the design, construction or interconnection status of the solar energy systems.\nThe cash contributed by the fund investor is used by the investment fund to purchase solar energy systems. The\ninvestment funds either own or enter into a master lease with a Sunrun subsidiary for the solar energy systems,\nCustomer Agreements and associated incentives. We receive on-going cash distributions from the investment funds\nrepresenting a portion of the monthly customer payments received. We use the upfront cash, as well as on-going\ndistributions to cover our costs associated with designing, purchasing and installing the solar energy systems. In\naddition, we also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our operations. The allocation of the\neconomic benefits between us and the fund investor and the corresponding accounting treatment varies depending\non the structure of the investment fund.\nWe currently utilize three legal structures in our investment funds, which we refer to as: (i) pass-through\nfinancing obligations, (ii) partnership flips and (iii) joint venture (“JV”) inverted leases. We reflect pass-through\nfinancing obligations on our consolidated balance sheet as a pass-through financing obligation. We record the\ninvestor’s interest in partnership flips or JV inverted leases (which we define collectively as “consolidated joint\nventures”) as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests. These consolidated joint ventures are\nusually redeemable at our option and, in certain cases, at the investor’s option. If redemption is at our option or the\nconsolidated joint ventures are not redeemable, we record the investor’s interest as a noncontrolling interest and\naccount for the interest using the HLBV method. If the investor has the option to put their interest to us, we record\nthe investor’s interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at the greater of the HLBV and the redemption value.\n57\nThe table below provides an overview of our current investment funds (dollars in millions):\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\nPass-Through\nFinancing\nObligations Partnership Flip JV Inverted Lease\nConsolidation Owner entity Single entity, Owner and tenant\nconsolidated, consolidated entities consolidated\ntenant entity not\nconsolidated\nBalance sheet classification Pass-through Redeemable Redeemable\nfinancing noncontrolling noncontrolling\nobligation interests and interests\nnoncontrolling\ninterests\nRevenue from Commercial ITCs Recognized on None None\nthe permission to\noperate date\nMethod of calculating investor interest Effective interest Greater of HLBV Greater of HLBV or\nrate method or redemption redemption value\nvalue\nLiability balance as of December 31, 2023 $ 294.6 N/A N/A\nN/A $ 1,678.5 $ 5.3\nNoncontrolling interest balance (redeemable or\notherwise) as of December 31, 2023\nFor further information regarding our investment funds, including the associated risks, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors—\"Our ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in\npart on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\", Note 12,\nPass-Through Financing Obligations, Note 13, VIE Arrangements and Note 14, Redeemable Noncontrolling\nInterests to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPass-through Financing Obligations\nPass-Through Financing Obligations. In this investment fund structure, we and the fund investor each utilize\nseparate entities to facilitate the pass-through of the Commercial ITC to the fund investors. We contribute solar\nenergy systems to an “owner” entity in exchange for interests in the owner entity, and the fund investors contribute\ncash to a “tenant” entity in exchange for interests in the tenant entity.\nUnder our pass-through financing obligation structure, in accordance with the provisions of FASB, Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, Consolidation, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of\nthe owner entity, and accordingly, we consolidate that entity. We have also determined that we are not the primary\nbeneficiary of the tenant entity, and accordingly, we do not consolidate that entity.\nIn this investment fund structure, the investors make a series of large up-front payments as well as, in some\ninstances, subsequent smaller quarterly lease payments through their respective tenant entity to the corresponding\nowner entity in exchange for the assignment of cash flows from Customer Agreements and certain other benefits\nassociated with the Customer Agreements and related solar energy systems. We account for the payments from\ninvestors as borrowings by recording the proceeds received as financing obligations. The financing obligation is\nreduced over a period of approximately 22 years, or over 7 years in the case of one fund, by customer payments\nunder the Customer Agreements; and proceeds from the contracted resale of SRECs as they are received by the\ninvestor. In addition, funds paid for the Commercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and\nrecognized as revenue as the associated solar system reaches permission to operate (\"PTO\").\n58\nWe account for these investment funds in our consolidated financial statements as if we have not assigned\nthe Customer Agreement to the investor, and we record on our consolidated financial statements activities arising\nfrom the Customer Agreements and any related Commercial ITCs monetized as part of the upfront payments\nreceived from the investor and SREC sales. The interest charge on our pass-through financing obligations is\nimputed at the inception of the fund based on the effective interest rate in the arrangement giving rise to the\nobligation and is updated prospectively as appropriate.\nIn certain arrangements, we agree to defer a portion of the up-front payments by arranging a loan between\none of our indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries to a subsidiary of the investor’s tenant entity.\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\nPartnership Flips. Under partnership flip structures, we and our fund investors contribute cash into a\npartnership entity. The partnership uses the cash to acquire solar energy systems developed by us with signed\nCustomer Agreements. Each fund investor receives a rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis, which varies by\ninvestment fund. Prior to the fund investor receiving its contractual rate of return or for a time period specified in the\ncontractual arrangements, the fund investor receives a significant portion of the value attributable to customer\npayments, a majority of the accelerated tax depreciation and substantially all of the Commercial ITCs. After the fund\ninvestor receives its contractual rate of return or after the specified time period, we receive substantially all of the\nvalue attributable to the remaining customer payments and SREC sales.\nUnder our partnership flip structures, we have determined that we control the partnership entity which is a\nvariable interest entity (“VIE”), and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record the investor’s interest as either\nnoncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInverted Leases. Under our inverted lease structure, we and the fund investor set up a multi-tiered\ninvestment vehicle that is comprised of two partnership entities which facilitate the pass through of the tax benefits\nto the fund investors. In this structure we contribute solar energy systems to an “owner” partnership entity in\nexchange for interests in the owner partnership and the fund investors contribute cash to a “tenant” partnership in\nexchange for interests in the tenant partnership, which in turn makes an investment in the owner partnership entity\nin exchange for interests in the owner partnership. The owner partnership uses the cash contributions received from\nthe tenant partnership to purchase systems from us and/or fund installation of such systems. Under our existing JV\ninverted lease structure, a substantial portion of the value generated by the solar energy systems is provided to the\nfund investor for a specified period of time, which is generally based upon the period of time corresponding to the\nexpiry of the recapture period associated with the Commercial ITCs. After that point in time, we receive substantially\nall of the value attributable to the long-term recurring customer payments and the other incentives. Generally, under\nthe terms of each agreement, the investors’ contributions include the value of Commercial ITCs earned or grants to\nbe received by the fund investor. Any other proceeds are allocated on a pro rata basis to the fund investor and us in\naccordance with their ownership percentages. Since Sunrun has the power to control both the owner and tenant\nentities, both entities are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor all of our partnership flips and JV inverted leases, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is carried on our\nbalance sheet at the greater of the redemption value or the amount calculated under the HLBV method. The HLBV\nmethod estimates the amount that, if the fund’s assets were hypothetically sold at their book value, the investor\nwould be entitled to receive according to the liquidation waterfall in the partnership agreement.\nKey Operating Metrics\nThe following operating metrics are used by management to evaluate the performance of the business.\nManagement believes these metrics provide investors with helpful information to determine the economic\nperformance of the business activities in a period that would otherwise not be observable from historic GAAP\nmeasures. We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate our\nbusiness, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make\nstrategic decisions. Some of our key operating metrics are estimates that are based on our management’s beliefs\nand assumptions and on information currently available to management. Although we believe that we have a\nreasonable basis for each of these estimates, we caution you that these estimates are based on a combination of\nassumptions that may prove to be inaccurate over time. Any inaccuracies could be material to our actual results\nwhen compared to our calculations. Please see the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor more information. Furthermore, other companies may calculate these metrics differently than we do now or in\nthe future, which would reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n59\n• Networked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our\nsolar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer\nAgreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to\nfinal inspection; (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have\naccrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems), or\n(iii) for multi-family and any other systems that have reached Notice to Proceed (“NTP”), measured\non the percentage of the project that has been completed based on expected project cost. Systems\nthat have met these criteria are considered to be deployed. We believe it is helpful to investors to\nevaluate networked solar energy capacity added during the period in order to measure the growth of\nour business as a whole, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer\nAgreements.\n• Gross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning\nAssets Renewal Period.\n◦ Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the\nremaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) during the initial term of our Customer\nAgreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash\nflows (discounted at 6%) we expect to receive from Subscribers in future periods, after\ndeducting expected operating and maintenance costs based on the service\nagreements underlying each fund, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax\nequity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and\ndistributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in\nfuture periods from state incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar\nrenewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs\nwith utility or grid operators.\n◦ Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would\nreceive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but\nbefore the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation (either in the form of cash\npayments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the\ninitial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross\nEarning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term\nassuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer\nrelationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the\nsystem), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer’s contractual rate in effect at\nthe end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer\nAgreements typically automatically renew annually or for five years and the rate is\ninitially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n• Subscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been\nrecognized as deployments through the measurement date.\n• Customers represent the cumulative number of deployments, from our inception through the\nmeasurement date. We believe that it is helpful to investors to evaluate customers\nadded during the period in order to measure the growth of our business as a whole.\nGross Earning Assets is forecasted as of a specific date. It is forward-looking, and we use judgment\nin developing the assumptions used to calculate it. Factors that could impact Gross Earning Assets\ninclude, but are not limited to, customer payment defaults, or declines in utility rates or early\ntermination of a contract in certain circumstances, including prior to installation. We believe it is\nuseful for investors to evaluate the future expected cash flows from all customers that have been\ndeployed through the respective measurement date, less estimated costs to maintain such systems\nand estimated distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip\n60\nstructures, and distributions to project equity investors. Various assumptions are made when\ncalculating these metrics. Gross Earning Assets utilize a 6% unlevered discount rate (weighted\naverage cost of capital or “WACC”) to discount future cash flows to the present period. Furthermore,\nthis metric assumes that customers renew after the initial contract period at a rate equal to 90% of\nthe rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. For Customer Agreements with 25-year initial\ncontract terms, a 5-year renewal period is assumed. For a 20-year initial contract term, a 10-year\nrenewal period is assumed. In all instances, we assume a 30-year customer relationship, although\nthe customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system. Estimated cost of servicing\nassets has been deducted and is estimated based on the service agreements underlying each fund.\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nNetworked Solar Energy Capacity (megawatts) 6,689 5,667\nCustomers 933,275 797,296\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022(1)\n(in thousands)\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period $ 10,802,494 $ 8,878,718\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period 3,364,026 3,546,821\nGross Earning Assets $ 14,166,520 $ 12,425,539\n(1) The Gross Earning Assets as of December 31, 2022 reflect the application of a 5% unlevered discount rate,\nwhich is consistent with the discount rate used during that period.

GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could\nhave reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates\nare reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. Our\nfuture financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates.\nFor further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that policies associated with our principles of consolidation, revenue recognition, goodwill,\nimpairment of long-lived assets, provision for income taxes, business combinations and calculation of noncontrolling\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests have the greatest impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a\ncontrolling financial interest. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest is holding a majority of the voting\ninterests of an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through\narrangements that do not involve controlling financial interests. We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary\nbeneficiary, which is defined as the party that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. We evaluate our relationships with our VIEs on an ongoing basis to\ndetermine whether we continue to be the primary beneficiary. Our financial statements reflect the assets and\nliabilities of VIEs that we consolidate. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. For further information regarding consolidation of our investment funds, see “—Investment Funds”\nabove.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives Revenue. Customer agreements and incentives revenue is primarily\ncomprised of revenue from our Customer Agreements and sales of Commercial ITCs and SRECs to third parties.\n62\nWe begin to recognize revenue from a Customer Agreement when PTO for the applicable solar energy\nsystem is given by the local utility company or on the date daily operation commences if utility approval is not\nrequired. For Customer Agreements that include a fixed fee per month which entitles the customer to any and all\nelectricity generated by the system, we recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance\nobligations over the initial term of Customer Agreements. For Customer Agreements that charge a fixed price per\nkilowatt hour, revenue is recognized based on the actual amount of power generated at rates specified under the\ncontracts. Customer Agreements typically have an initial term of 20 or 25 years. After the initial contract term, our\nCustomer Agreements typically automatically renew annually or for five years.\nWe also apply for and receive SRECs associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and\nsell them to third parties in certain jurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related\nto possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than contractually committed, and is generally\nrecognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nCertain upfront payments related to Customer Agreements and SRECs are deemed to have a financing\ncomponent, and therefore increase both revenue and interest expense by the same amount over the term of the\nrelated agreement. The additional revenue is included in the total transaction price to be recorded over the term of\nthe agreement and is recognized based on the timing of the delivery. The interest expense is recognized based\nupon an amortization schedule which typically decreases throughout the term of the related agreement.\nFor pass-through financing obligation funds, the value attributable to the Commercial ITCs is recognized in\nthe period a solar system is granted PTO, at which point we have met our obligation to the investor. The\nCommercial ITCs are subject to recapture under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) if the underlying solar energy\nsystem either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placed-\nin-service date. The recapture amount decreases on the anniversary of the PTO date. We have not historically\nincurred a material recapture of Commercial ITCs, and do not expect to experience a material recapture of\nCommercial ITCs in the future.\nConsideration from customers is considered variable due to the performance guarantee under Customer\nAgreements and liquidated damage provisions under SREC contracts in the event minimum deliveries are not\nachieved. Customer Agreements with a performance guarantee provide a credit to the customer if the system's\ncumulative production, as measured on various PTO anniversary dates, is below our guarantee of a specified\nminimum. Revenue is recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not\noccur. If our estimate of the future production shortfall amount for Customer Agreements with a performance\nguarantee was 10% higher, the additional reduction to revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nwould have been less than $3.3 million. Our estimated production shortfall reduced revenue during the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 by less than $8.3 million more than the prior year's period. We have historically\nestimated an immaterial amount of liquidated damages pursuant to SREC contracts, and actual damages have not\nbeen materially different from estimates, nor material in amount during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Solar energy systems sales are revenue from the sale of solar\nenergy systems directly to customers. We generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to\ncustomers when the solar energy system passes inspection by the authority having jurisdiction, which inspection\ngenerally occurs after installation but prior to PTO, at which time we have met the performance obligation in the\ncontract. For solar energy system sales that include delivery obligations up until interconnection to the local power\ngrid with permission to operate, we recognize revenue at PTO. Certain solar energy systems sold to customers\ninclude fees for extended warranty and maintenance services. These fees are recognized over the life of the service\nagreement.\nProduct sales revenue consists of revenue from the sale of solar panels, inverters, racking systems, roof\nrepair, and other solar energy products sold to resellers, as well as the sale of customer leads to third parties,\nincluding our partners and other solar providers. Product sales revenue is recognized when control is transferred,\ngenerally upon shipment, or as services are delivered. Customer lead revenue is recognized at the time the lead is\ndelivered.\n63\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may be impaired. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and our\ngoodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill on\nOctober 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would indicate that\ngoodwill might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use qualitative and if necessary,\nquantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Goodwill. We also consider our enterprise value and\nif necessary, a discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and estimates, including our future\nfinancial performance, weighted average cost of capital and interpretation of currently enacted tax laws.\nCircumstances that could indicate impairment and require us to perform a quantitative impairment test include\na significant decline in our financial results, a significant decline in our enterprise value relative to our net book\nvalue, a sustained decline in our stock price, or an unanticipated change in competition or our market share and a\nsignificant change in our strategic plans. A sustained decrease in the price of our common stock is one of the\nqualitative factors to be considered as part of an impairment test when evaluating whether events or changes in\ncircumstances may indicate that it is more likely than not that a potential goodwill impairment exists.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, consistent with other industry peers, our stock price continued to\ndecline resulting in a decline in our market capitalization after consideration of a control premium below the book\nvalue of equity. We performed an interim quantitative assessment as of September 30, 2023 related to the\nrecoverability of our goodwill for our one reporting unit. We estimated the fair value of our reporting unit primarily\nbased on consideration of an income approach analysis. Under the income approach, our future cash flows were\nestimated and present valued based on a discount rate reflecting a market participant risk-adjusted rate of return.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we concluded that the fair value of our one reporting unit did not exceed its carrying\nvalue with consideration of a control premium and recorded an impairment charge of $1.2 billion in our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nFor our interim quantitative assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023, we estimated the fair value of\nour one reporting unit and compared that fair value to its recorded carrying value. The assumptions and estimates\nused in the assessment include, among others, estimated future net annual contracted cash flows under our\nexisting long term customer agreements, as well as future growth estimates which rely on management\njudgements. We also compared the total invested capital (including market capitalization) to the fair value of our\nreporting unit to assess the reasonableness of fair value after consideration of a control premium based on\nobservable comparable company transactions.\nWe utilized varying discount rates depending on the risk associated and sensitivity with differing cash flow\nprojections. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate assumptions\nwould have increased the goodwill impairment charge by approximately $0.5 billion. Should, among other events\nand circumstances, industry conditions deteriorate, the outlook for future operating results and cash flow decline or\nregulations change, costs of equity or debt capital increase, valuations for comparable public companies or\ncomparable acquisition valuations decrease, or our market capitalization experience a further sustained decline\nbelow its book value, we may need to further reassess the recoverability of goodwill in future periods. Given the\ninherent estimation uncertainty in assumptions underlying a discounted cash flow analysis, actual conditions may\ndiffer materially from the Company’s estimates, which could result in additional impairment charges.\nAs of October 1, 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test. The test concluded that no\nadditional impairment had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. To corroborate this conclusion, we compared\nthe carrying value of our one reporting unit to our enterprise market capitalization after consideration of a\nreasonable control premium and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n64\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying values of our long-lived assets, including solar energy systems, are periodically reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not\nbe recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Factors that we consider in deciding when\nto perform an impairment review would include significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant\nchanges or planned changes in our use of the assets. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of\nthe carrying value of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate over\nits remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the\ndifference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than\noriginally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. During the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no indicators of impairment and therefore no cash flow\nanalysis was performed.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact\nof temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts\nrecognized for income tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits measured by\napplying currently enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance is provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax\nassets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and\nnegative, including historical levels of income, estimates of future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary\ndifferences, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We recognize the\neffect of tax rate and law changes on deferred taxes in the reporting period in which the legislation is enacted.\nWe sell solar energy systems to investment funds. As the investment funds are consolidated by us, the gain\non the sale of the solar energy systems is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. However, this\ngain is recognized for tax reporting purposes. We account for the income tax consequences of these intra-entity\ntransfers, both current and deferred, as a component of income tax expense and deferred tax liability, net during the\nperiod in which the transfers occur.\nWe account for investment tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the credits\narise (i.e. the flow-through method).\nWe determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including\nresolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. We use a\ntwo-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax\nposition for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that\nthe position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely\nof being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOur policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision\nfor taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The\nallocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to the solar energy systems acquired as part of our\nacquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020.\nSignificant estimates in valuing certain tangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates. These\nestimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\n65\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOur noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent fund investors’ interests in the\nnet assets of certain investment funds, which we consolidate, that we have entered into in order to finance the costs\nof solar energy facilities under Customer Agreements. We have determined that the provisions in the contractual\narrangements of the investment funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, which gives rise to the\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We have further determined that for all but two of\nthese arrangements, the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method.\nAttributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests under the\nHLBV method requires the use of various inputs to calculate the amounts that fund investors would receive upon a\nhypothetical liquidation. Changes in these inputs, including change in tax rates, can have a significant impact on the\namount that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation.\nWe classify certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control\noutside of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported\nusing the greater of their carrying value at each reporting date as determined by the HLBV method or their\nestimated redemption value in each reporting period. Estimating the redemption value of the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such as projected future cash\nflows at the time the redemption feature can be exercised.\nWe determine the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by deducting from net loss, the net\nloss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in these funds. The net loss\nattributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represents the fund investors’\nallocable share in the results of operations of these investment funds. For these funds, we have determined that the\nprovisions in the contractual arrangements represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, where the allocations\nto the partners sometimes differ from the stated ownership percentages. We have further determined that, for these\narrangements, the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method. Under the\nHLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations reflect changes in the amounts the fund\ninvestors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual\nprovisions of these funds, assuming the net assets of the respective investment funds were liquidated at the\ncarrying value determined in accordance with GAAP. The fund investors’ interest in the results of operations of\nthese investment funds is initially determined by calculating the difference in the noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests’ claim under the HLBV method at the start and end of each reporting period,\nafter taking into account any contributions and distributions between the fund and the fund investors and subject to\nthe redemption provisions in certain funds.\nThe calculation of HLBV does not require estimates since each HLBV calculation is based upon the\nliquidation provisions of each fund’s contractual agreement. The calculation of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest balance involves estimates such as a discount rate used in net present value calculations, and customer\ndefault rates. If the assumptions used for each of these were 10% higher, the impact to the aggregate redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balance as of December 31, 2023 would be a reduction of $20.6 million.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and\nresults of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n66\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nCustomer agreements and incentives $ 1,186,706 $ 983,047\nSolar energy systems and product sales 1,073,107 1,338,375\nTotal revenue 2,259,813 2,321,422\nOperating expenses:\nCost of customer agreements and incentives 1,077,114 844,162\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 1,019,638 1,178,548\nSales and marketing 740,821 745,386\nResearch and development 21,816 20,907\nGeneral and administrative 221,067 194,611\nGoodwill impairment 1,158,000 —\nTotal operating expenses 4,238,456 2,983,614\nLoss from operations (1,978,643) (662,192)\nInterest expense, net (652,989) (445,819)\nOther (expense) income, net (63,900) 260,657\nLoss before income taxes (2,695,532) (847,354)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (12,691) 2,291\nNet loss (2,682,841) (849,645)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests (1,078,344) (1,023,022)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (1,604,497) $ 173,377\nNet (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders\nBasic $ (7.41) $ 0.82\nDiluted $ (7.41) $ 0.80\nWeighted average shares used to compute net (loss) income per\nshare attributable to common stockholders\nBasic 216,642 211,347\nDiluted 216,642 219,157\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCustomer agreements $ 1,077,099 $ 872,298 $ 204,801 23 %\nIncentives 109,607 110,749 (1,142) (1) %\nCustomer agreements and incentives 1,186,706 983,047 203,659 21 %\nSolar energy systems 656,408 913,904 (257,496) (28) %\nProducts 416,699 424,471 (7,772) (2) %\nSolar energy systems and product sales 1,073,107 1,338,375 (265,268) (20) %\nTotal revenue $ 2,259,813 $ 2,321,422 $ (61,609) (3) %\n67\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives.

Revenue from solar energy systems sales decreased by $257.5\nmillion compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the proportion of customers choosing to enter into\na Customer Agreement versus purchasing a system outright using a loan, likely due to increased interest rates.\nProduct sales decreased by $7.8 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the lower average sales price of\nsolar energy products, as well as lower sales volume of solar energy products to installers of solar energy systems\ncompared to the prior year, due to easing of supply chain constraints.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nCost of customer agreements and incentives $ 1,077,114 $ 844,162 $ 232,952 28 %\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 1,019,638 1,178,548 (158,910) (13) %\nSales and marketing 740,821 745,386 (4,565) (1) %\nResearch and development 21,816 20,907 909 4 %\nGeneral and administrative expense 221,067 194,611 26,456 14 %\nGoodwill impairment 1,158,000 — 1,158,000 100 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 4,238,456 $ 2,983,614 $ 1,254,842 42 %\nCost of Customer Agreements and Incentives. The $233.0 million increase in Cost of customer agreements\nand incentives was primarily due to the new systems placed in service in 2023, plus a full year of costs recognized\nin 2023 for systems placed in service in 2022 versus only a partial amount of such expenses related to the period in\nwhich the assets were in service in 2022.\nThe Cost of customer agreements and incentives increased to 91% of customer agreements and incentives\nrevenue during 2023, from 86% in the prior year. This increase is primarily due to a higher proportion of customers\nchoosing to enter into Customer Agreements versus purchasing a system outright. Customer Agreements fulfillment\nincurs upfront non-capitalizable costs for building the system which do not recur during the agreement period over\nwhich the revenue is recognized.\nCost of Solar Energy Systems and Product Sales. There was a $158.9 million decrease in Cost of solar\nenergy systems and product sales, which was primarily due to the corresponding net decrease in the solar energy\nsystems and product sales discussed above.\nThe Cost of solar energy systems and product sales increased to 95% of solar energy systems and product\nsales revenue during 2023, when compared with 88% in the prior year, primarily as a result of sales price increases\nlagging cost increases, as well as volume pricing granted in our distribution business.\nSales and Marketing Expense. The $4.6 million decrease in Sales and marketing expense was primarily\nattributable to decreases in headcount driving lower employee compensation and costs to acquire customers\nthrough our sales lead generating partners. Included in sales and marketing expense were $56.3 million and $38.7\nmillion of amortization of costs to obtain Customer Agreements for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense. The $0.9 million increase in Research and development expense was\nprimarily attributable to an increase in support related consulting costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. The $26.5 million increase in General and administrative expenses was\nprimarily attributable to an increase in headcount driving higher employee compensation costs. Additionally, there\n68\nwere increases related to information technology related consulting costs, when compared to the prior year period.\nIncluded in general and administrative expense were $7.458 million and $5.364 million of amortization of intangibles\nfor 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGoodwill impairment. The $1.2 billion increase in Goodwill impairment expense related to an impairment\ncharge of $1.2 billion that was a result of an interim impairment test performed during the third quarter of 2023. For\nfurther detail, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statement\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense, net $ (652,989) $ (445,819) $ (207,170) 46 %\nOther (expense) income, net (63,900) 260,657 (324,557) (125) %\nTotal interest and other expense, net $ (716,889) $ (185,162) $ (531,727) 287 %\nInterest expense, net. The increase in Interest expense, net of $207.2 million is primarily related to additional\nnon-recourse debt entered into in 2023. Included in net interest expense is $31.2 million and $28.3 million of non-\ncash interest recognized under Customer Agreements that have a significant financing component for 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nOther (expense) income, net. The increase in other expense of $324.6 million relates primarily to a $58.7\nmillion loss on an equity investment in Lunar Energy Inc. (“Lunar Energy”) during 2023, compared with a $47.3\nmillion gain on this same equity investment in Lunar Energy during 2022, as well as to gains on derivatives during\n2022, with no such comparable activity in 2023.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense $ (12,691) $ 2,291 $ (14,982) (654) %\nThe decrease in Income tax (benefit) expense of $15.0 million primarily relates to an increase in tax benefit\nrelated to a higher pre-tax loss, which was offset by goodwill impairment, an increase in valuation allowance on\ncertain federal and state tax credits and net operating losses, and an increase in noncontrolling interest and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests.\nGiven our net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023, we do not expect to pay income tax,\nincluding in connection with our 2023 income tax provision, until our net operating losses are fully utilized. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of\napproximately $720.7 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2028 for federal purposes\nand in 2024 for state purposes. In addition, federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards generated in\ntax years beginning after December 31, 2017 total $2.0 billion and $357.1 million, respectively, and have indefinite\ncarryover periods and do not expire.\n69\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests $ (1,078,344) $ (1,023,022) $ (55,322) 5 %\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was primarily the\nresult of an addition of six new investment funds since December 31, 2022, for which the HLBV method was used in\ndetermining the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Investment funds generally allocate more\nloss to the noncontrolling interest in the first several years after fund formation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash of $678.8 million, which consisted of cash held in checking and\nsavings accounts with financial institutions. We finance our operations mainly through a variety of financing fund\narrangements that we have formed with fund investors, cash generated from our sources of revenue and\nborrowings from secured credit facilities arrangements with syndicates of banks and from secured, long-term non-\nrecourse loan arrangements. In 2023, we received $1.0 billion of new commitments on secured credit facilities\narrangements with syndicates of banks and $0.8 billion of commitments from secured, long-term non-recourse loan\narrangements. Our principal uses of cash are funding our business, including the costs of acquisition and\ninstallation of solar energy systems, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments and other working\ncapital requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of $539.5 million on our $600.0\nmillion credit facility maturing in January 2025. In February 2024, we amended one of our subsidiary’s senior\nsecured credit facility to, among other things, increase the total commitments from $1.8 billion to $2.35 billion and\nextend the maturity date from April 2025 to April 2028. In February 2024, we amended our bank line of credit to,\namong other things, reduce the total commitments from $600.0 million to $447.5 million, and to extend the maturity\ndate from January 2025 to November 2025. This maturity date can be further extended to March 2027, if we meet\ncertain liquidity tests as of September 30, 2024. For additional details, see the description of \"Senior Secured Credit\nFacility\" and \"Line of Credit\" in Item 9B.Other Information.\nAdditionally, we have purchase commitments, which have the ability to be canceled without significant penalties,\nwith multiple suppliers to purchase $366.4 million of photovoltaic modules, inverters and batteries by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2025. In January 2021, we issued $400.0 million of convertible senior notes with a maturity date of\nFebruary 1, 2026, for net proceeds of approximately $389.0 million. Our business model requires substantial\noutside financing arrangements to grow the business and facilitate the deployment of additional solar energy\nsystems. The solar energy systems that are operational are expected to generate a positive return rate over the\nterm of the Customer Agreement, typically 20 or 25 years. However, in order to grow, we will continue to be\ndependent on financing from outside parties. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when\nneeded, we may be required to reduce planned spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our\noperations. While there can be no assurances, we anticipate raising additional required capital from new and\nexisting investors. We believe our cash, investment fund commitments and available borrowings as further\ndescribed below will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We believe we\nwill meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from\noperating activities, available cash balances, and available credit via our credit facilities. The following table\nsummarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n70\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nConsolidated cash flow data:\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (820,740) $ (848,793)\nNet cash used in investing activities (2,613,143) (2,086,066)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 3,468,698 3,037,451\nNet increase in cash $ 34,815 $ 102,592\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2023, we used $820.7 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash\noutflow consisted of the cost of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs.\nDuring 2023, our operating cash outflows were $625.5 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-\noperating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash outflow of $195.3 million.\nDuring 2022, we used $848.8 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash\noutflow consisted of the cost of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs.\nDuring 2022, our operating cash outflows were $438.1 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-\noperating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash outflow of $410.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2023, we used $2.6 billion in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and\ninstall solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements. Included within cash used\nin investing activities during 2023, was a $5.0 million contribution we made as an additional investment in Lunar\nEnergy.\nDuring 2022, we used $2.1 billion in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and\ninstall solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements. Included within cash used\nin investing activities during 2022, was a $75.0 million contribution we made as an additional investment in Lunar\nEnergy.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2023, we generated $3.5 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $1.4 billion in\nnet proceeds from fund investors, $2.2 billion in net proceeds from debt, $22.6 million in net proceeds from stock-\nbased awards activity, offset by $1.5 million in repurchase of convertible senior notes, $46.3 million in acquisition of\nnoncontrolling interests and $23.3 million in repayments under finance lease obligations.\nDuring 2022, we generated $3.0 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $1.2 billion in\nnet proceeds from fund investors, $1.9 billion in net proceeds from debt, $32.9 million in net proceeds from stock-\nbased awards activity, offset by $42.6 million in acquisition of noncontrolling interests and $14.1 million in\nrepayments under finance lease obligations.\nDebt, Equity, and Financing Fund Commitments\nDebt Instruments\nFor a discussion of the terms and conditions of debt instruments and changes thereof in the period, refer to\nNote 10, Indebtedness, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n71\nInvestment Fund Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had committed and available capital of approximately $386.9 million that may\nonly be used to purchase and install solar energy systems. We intend to establish new investment funds in the\nfuture, and we may also use debt, equity or other financing strategies to finance our business.\n72\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n73\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our primary exposure\nincludes changes in interest rates because certain borrowings bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or\nSOFR, as applicable, plus a specified margin. We sometimes manage our interest rate exposure on floating-rate\ndebt by entering into derivative instruments to hedge all or a portion of our interest rate exposure in certain debt\nfacilities. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in economic\nconditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and operating expenses and\nreducing funds available for capital investments, operations and other purposes. A hypothetical 10% increase in our\ninterest rates on our variable rate debt facilities would have increased our interest expense by $11.7 million and\n$6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n74\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests and stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\n76\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nDescription of matter At December 31, 2023, noncontrolling interests were $1.0 billion and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests were $0.7 billion. As explained in Note 2\nto the consolidated financial statements, noncontrolling interests and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests represent investors’ interests in the net assets of the tax\nequity funds that the Company has created to finance the cost of its solar energy\nsystems subject to the Company’s Customer Agreements. The Company has\ndetermined that the contractual provisions in the funding arrangements represent\nsubstantive profit sharing arrangements. The Company has further determined\nthat the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the\nnoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a\nbalance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value\n(“HLBV”) method.\nAuditing the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is\ncomplex due to the volume of tax equity funds and the allocation of the net\nincome or loss to the equity holders. Each HLBV calculation is based upon the\nliquidation provisions of each fund’s contractual agreement used to calculate the\namount of income or loss to be attributed to the noncontrolling member.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating\nOur Audit effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement\nrelating to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nThis included evaluating controls over establishing each HLBV model and\nmanagement’s review of each significant input into the HLBV models for\ncompliance with the contractual provisions of such funding arrangements, the\ncompleteness and accuracy of underlying data, the calculation of tax capital\naccounts, and the mathematical accuracy of the HLBV models.\nTo test the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, our\naudit procedures included, among others, examining the HLBV models for\ncompliance with contractual provisions in the funding arrangements. We tested\nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the HLBV models.\nWe involved tax professionals to assist in evaluating the calculation of the tax\ncapital accounts in accordance with the tax code, as well as compliance with\ncontractual provisions in the funding arrangements. We also tested the\nmathematical accuracy of management’s HLBV models.\nGoodwill\nDescription of matter As reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31,\n2023, the Company’s goodwill was $3.1 billion. As disclosed in Note 2 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually on\nOctober 1 or when indicators of impairment exist which suggest that the carrying\nvalue may not be recoverable. In 2023, the Company determined there was an\nindicator of impairment for sustained decline in stock price and performed an interim\nquantitative assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, the Company\nconcluded that goodwill for its one reporting unit was partially impaired and\nrecognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\nAuditing management’s third quarter quantitative goodwill impairment test was\nsubjective and required the involvement of a specialist due to the measurement\nuncertainty in determining fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value\nestimate was sensitive to significant assumptions in discount rates applied to\nestimated future cashflows which may be affected by future market conditions.\n77\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating\nOur Audit effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment\nprocess. Our procedures included testing controls over management’s review of the\nsignificant assumptions in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and the related\nevaluation of management’s specialist. We also tested controls over management\nreview of the reconciliation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the total\ninvested capital (including market capitalization) of the Company.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, specifically using the income\napproach, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the\nvaluation methodology used to determine the fair value, testing the significant\nassumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the\nunderlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s\nforecasted cash flows used in the fair value estimate by comparing those assumptions\nto the historical results of the Company and current industry trends. Additionally, we\nperformed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the effect on\nthe fair value estimate of the reporting unit. We also audited the reconciliation of that\nfair value estimate to the total invested capital (including market capitalization) of its\nreporting unit in consideration of a control premium based on observable comparable\ncompany transactions. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating\nthe significant assumptions in the fair value estimate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\n78\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Sunrun Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Sunrun Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Sunrun Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 21,\n2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on\nthe assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\n79\nSunrun Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Thousands, Except Share Par Values)\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 678,821 $ 740,508\nRestricted cash 308,869 212,367\nAccounts receivable (net of allowances for credit losses of $19,042 and $13,381\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) 172,001 214,255\nInventories 459,746 783,904\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 262,822 146,609\nTotal current assets 1,882,259 2,097,643\nRestricted cash 148 148\nSolar energy systems, net 13,028,871 10,988,361\nProperty and equipment, net 149,139 67,439\nGoodwill 3,122,168 4,280,169\nOther assets 2,267,652 1,835,045\nTotal assets (1) $ 20,450,237 $ 19,268,805\nLiabilities and total equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 230,723 $ 339,166\nDistributions payable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 35,180 32,050\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 499,225 406,466\nDeferred revenue, current portion 128,600 183,719\nDeferred grants, current portion 8,199 8,252\nFinance lease obligations, current portion 22,053 11,444\nNon-recourse debt, current portion 547,870 157,810\nPass-through financing obligation, current portion 16,309 16,544\nTotal current liabilities 1,488,159 1,155,451\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion 1,067,461 912,254\nDeferred grants, net of current portion 195,724 201,094\nFinance lease obligations, net of current portion 68,753 17,302\nLine of credit 539,502 505,158\nNon-recourse debt, net of current portion 9,191,689 7,343,299\nConvertible senior notes 392,867 392,882\nPass-through financing obligation, net of current portion 278,333 289,011\nOther liabilities 190,866 140,290\nDeferred tax liabilities 122,870 133,047\nTotal liabilities (1) 13,536,224 11,089,788\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 18)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests 676,177 609,702\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value—authorized, 200,000 shares as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022; no shares issued and outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022 — —\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value—authorized, 2,000,000 shares as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022; issued and outstanding, 219,392 and\n214,184 shares as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively 22 21\nAdditional paid-in capital 6,609,229 6,470,194\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss 54,676 67,109\nRetained earnings (1,433,699) 170,798\nTotal stockholders’ equity 5,230,228 6,708,122\nNoncontrolling interests 1,007,608 861,193\nTotal equity 6,237,836 7,569,315\nTotal liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and total equity $ 20,450,237 $ 19,268,805\n80\n(1)\nThe Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 include $11,538,540 and $10,031,506, respectively, in assets\nof variable interest entities, or “VIEs”, that can only be used to settle obligations of the VIEs.

Organization\nSunrun Inc. (“Sunrun” or the “Company”) was formed in 2007 and is engaged in the design, development,\ninstallation, sale, ownership and maintenance of residential solar energy systems (“Projects”) in the United States.\nSunrun acquires customers directly and through relationships with various solar and strategic partners\n(“Partners”). The Projects are constructed either by Sunrun or by Sunrun’s Partners and are owned by the\nCompany. Sunrun’s customers enter into an agreement to utilize the solar energy system (“Customer Agreement”)\nwhich typically has an initial term of 20 or 25 years. Sunrun monitors, maintains and insures the Projects. The\nCompany also sells solar energy systems and products, such as panels and racking and solar leads generated to\ncustomers.\nThe Company has formed various subsidiaries (“Funds”) to finance the development of Projects. These\nFunds, structured as limited liability companies, obtain financing from outside investors and purchase or lease\nProjects from Sunrun under master purchase or master lease agreements. The Company currently utilizes three\nlegal structures in its investment Funds, which are referred to as: (i) pass-through financing obligations,\n(ii) partnership-flips and (iii) joint venture (“JV”) inverted leases.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and reflect the accounts and operations of the Company and those of its\nsubsidiaries, including Funds, in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The typical condition for a\ncontrolling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity. However, a controlling\nfinancial interest may also exist in entities, such as variable interest entities (“VIEs”), through arrangements that do\nnot involve controlling voting interests. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, Consolidation, the Company consolidates any VIE\nof which it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary, as defined in FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, is\nthe party that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic\nperformance and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company evaluates its relationships with its VIEs on an ongoing\nbasis to determine whether it continues to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements reflect\nthe assets and liabilities of VIEs that are consolidated. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nThe Company regularly makes estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition\nconstraints that result in variable consideration, the discount rate used to adjust the promised amount of\nconsideration for the effects of a significant financing component, the estimates that affect the collectability of\naccounts receivable, the valuation of inventories, the useful lives of solar energy systems, the useful lives of\nproperty and equipment, the discount rates used in the goodwill impairment calculation, the effective interest rate\nused to amortize pass-through financing obligations, the discount rate used for operating and financing leases, the\nvaluation of stock-based compensation, the determination of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax\nassets, the fair value of debt instruments disclosed and the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to\nbe reasonable. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\n86\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nSegment Information\nThe Company has one operating segment with one business activity, providing solar energy services and\nproducts to customers. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer, who\nmanages operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources. When evaluating performance\nand allocating resources, the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis.\nRevenue from external customers (including, but not limited to homeowners) for each group of similar\nproducts and services is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCustomer agreements $ 1,077,099 $ 872,298 $ 725,220\nIncentives 109,607 110,749 101,344\nCustomer agreements and incentives 1,186,706 983,047 826,564\nSolar energy systems 656,408 913,904 471,283\nProducts 416,699 424,471 312,107\nSolar energy systems and product sales 1,073,107 1,338,375 783,390\nTotal revenue $ 2,259,813 $ 2,321,422 $ 1,609,954\nRevenue from Customer Agreements includes payments by customers for the use of the system as well as\nutility and other rebates assigned by the customer to the Company in the Customer Agreement. Revenue from\nincentives includes revenue from the sale of commercial investment tax credits (\"Commercial ITCs\") and solar\nrenewable energy credits (“SRECs”).\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash consists of bank deposits held in checking and savings accounts. The Company considers all highly\nliquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\nhas exposure to credit risk to the extent cash balances exceed amounts covered by federal deposit insurance. The\nCompany believes that its credit risk is not significant.\nRestricted cash represents amounts related to obligations under certain financing transactions and future\nreplacement of solar energy system components.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported within the consolidated\nbalance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCash and restricted cash consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash $ 678,821 $ 740,508 $ 617,634\nRestricted cash, current and long-term 309,017 212,515 232,797\nTotal $ 987,838 $ 953,023 $ 850,431\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers as well as state and utility rebates due from\ngovernment agencies and utility companies. Under Customer Agreements, the customers typically assign incentive\nrebates to the Company.\nAccounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. The Company maintains allowances for the\napplicable portion of receivables using the expected credit loss model. The Company estimates expected credit\nlosses from doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivables, which takes into\naccount the number of days past due, collection history, identification of specific customer exposure, current\n87\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\neconomic trends, and management’s expectation of future economic conditions. Once a receivable is deemed to be\nuncollectible, it is written off. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded provisions for credit losses of $21.7\nmillion, $17.0 million and $11.7 million, respectively, and wrote-off uncollectible receivables of $15.8 million, $10.3\nmillion and $5.6 million, respectively.\nAccounts receivable, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCustomer receivables $ 186,537 $ 218,712\nOther receivables 4,506 8,924\nAllowance for credit losses (19,042) (13,381)\nTotal $ 172,001 $ 214,255\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories\nconsist of raw materials such as photovoltaic panels, inverters and mounting hardware as well as miscellaneous\nelectrical components that are sold as-is by the distribution operations and used in installations and work-in-\nprocess. Work-in-process primarily relates to solar energy systems that will be sold to customers, which are partially\ninstalled and have yet to meet the criteria for revenue recognition. For solar energy systems where the Company\nperforms the installation, the Company commences transferring component parts from inventories to construction-\nin-progress, a component of solar energy systems, once a lease contract with a lease customer has been executed\nand the component parts have been assigned to a specific project. Additional costs incurred including labor and\noverhead are recorded within construction in progress.\nThe Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items based on assumptions about\nfuture demand and market conditions. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to\ntheir market value.\nSolar Energy Systems, net\nThe Company records solar energy systems subject to signed Customer Agreements and solar energy\nsystems that are under installation as solar energy systems, net on its consolidated balance sheet. Solar energy\nsystems, net is comprised of system equipment costs related to solar energy systems, less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation on solar energy systems is calculated on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful lives of the systems of 35 years. The Company periodically reviews its estimated useful life and\nrecognizes changes in estimates by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. Inverters and batteries are\ndepreciated over their estimated useful life of 10 to 13 years.\nSolar energy systems under construction will be depreciated as solar energy systems subject to signed\nCustomer Agreements when the respective systems are completed and interconnected.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net consists of leasehold improvements, furniture, computer hardware and\nsoftware, machinery and equipment and automobiles. All property and equipment are stated at historical cost net of\naccumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n88\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nProperty and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following periods:\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of 6 years or lease term\nFurniture 5 years\nComputer hardware and software 3 years\nMachinery and equipment 5 years or lease term\nAutomobiles Lease term\nCapitalization of Software Costs\nFor costs incurred in the development of internal use software, the Company capitalizes costs incurred during\nthe application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities\nare expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of\n3 years. Costs of $21.3 million, $10.0 million and $6.2 million were capitalized in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying values of the Company’s long-lived assets, including solar energy systems, are periodically\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these\nassets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Factors that are considered\nin deciding when to perform an impairment review would include significant negative industry or economic trends\nand significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. Recoverability of these assets is measured by\ncomparison of the carrying value of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is\nexpected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset group is considered to be impaired, the amount of any\nimpairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset group.\nIf the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the Company amortizes the remaining carrying value over the\nnew shorter useful life. The Company has recognized no material impairments of its long-lived assets in any of the\nperiods presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Company has determined that it operates as one reporting\nunit and the Company’s goodwill is recorded at the enterprise level. The Company performs its annual impairment\ntest of goodwill on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would\nindicate that goodwill might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company uses qualitative\nand if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Goodwill. The Company also\nconsiders its enterprise value and if necessary, discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and\nestimates, including the Company’s future financial performance, weighted average cost of capital and interpretation\nof currently enacted tax laws.\nCircumstances that could indicate impairment and require the Company to perform a quantitative impairment\ntest include significant declines in the Company’s financial results or enterprise value relative to its net book value or\na sustained decline in the Company's stock price below its book value, coupled with declines in valuations for\ncomparable public companies or acquisition premiums. The Company tests goodwill for impairment for its one\nreporting unit using an estimated fair value approach. The Company’s stock price has continued to decline during\n2023, consistent with other industry peers, experiencing a significant decline during the third quarter. A sustained\ndecrease in the Company’s stock price is one of the qualitative factors to be considered as part of an impairment\ntest when evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances may indicate that it is more likely than not that a\npotential goodwill impairment exists.\n89\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nDue to the continued sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization after consideration of a control\npremium below the book value of equity, the Company performed a quantitative assessment as of September 30,\n2023 related to the recoverability of its goodwill for its one reporting unit. The Company estimated the fair value of\nits reporting unit primarily based on consideration of an income approach analysis. Under the income approach,\nfuture cash flows of the Company were estimated and present valued based on a discount rate reflecting a market\nparticipant risk-adjusted rate of return. As of September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that the fair value of the\nCompany’s one reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value with consideration of a control premium and\nrecorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.2 billion in its consolidated statements of operations. This\nimpairment charge did not result in a change to previously recorded deferred taxes, as goodwill was not deductible\nfor tax purposes, nor did it impact the Company’s liquidity position, its debt covenants or cash flows.\nThe assumptions and estimates used in the assessment include, among others, estimated future net annual\ncontracted cash flows under its existing long term customer agreements, as well as future growth estimates which\nrely on management judgements. The Company selected estimates used in the discounted cash flow projections\nusing historical data as well as current and anticipated market conditions, and estimated growth rates with\nconsideration of published industry trends. The Company also compared the total invested capital (including market\ncapitalization) to the fair value of its reporting unit to assess the reasonableness of fair value after consideration of a\ncontrol premium based on observable comparable company transactions. After the impairment charge, the fair\nvalue of the Company’s one reporting unit approximated its estimated carrying value as of September 30, 2023. As\nof October 1, 2023, the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test. The test concluded that no\nadditional impairment had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDeferred Revenue\nWhen the Company receives consideration, or when such consideration is unconditionally due, from a\ncustomer prior to delivering goods or services to the customer under the terms of a Customer Agreement, the\nCompany records deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue consists of amounts for which the criteria for revenue\nrecognition have not yet been met and includes amounts that are collected or assigned from customers, including\nupfront deposits and prepayments, and rebates. Deferred revenue relating to financing components represents the\ncumulative excess of interest expense recorded on financing component elements over the related revenue\nrecognized to date and will eventually net to zero by the end of the initial term. Amounts received related to the\nsales of SRECs which have not yet been delivered to the counterparty are recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe opening balance of deferred revenue was $873.6 million as of December 31, 2021. Deferred revenue\nconsists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nUnder Customer Agreements:\nPayments received, net $ 873,137 $ 840,771\nFinancing component balance 72,289 65,326\n945,426 906,097\nUnder SREC contracts:\nPayments received, net 237,800 179,416\nFinancing component balance 12,835 10,460\n250,635 189,876\nTotal $ 1,196,061 $ 1,095,973\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $113.3\nmillion, $99.0 million and $86.3 million, respectively, from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of\nthe respective periods. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that\nhas not yet been recognized and includes deferred revenue as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized\nas revenue in future periods. Contracted but not yet recognized revenue was approximately $25.1 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 5% over the next 12 months. The\nannual recognition is not expected to vary significantly over the next 10 years as the vast majority of existing\n90\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nCustomer Agreements have at least 10 years remaining, given that the average age of the Company's fleet of\nresidential solar energy systems under Customer Agreements is less than five years due to the Company being\nformed in 2007 and having experienced significant growth in the last few years. The annual recognition on these\nexisting contracts will gradually decline over the midpoint of the Customer Agreements over the following 10 years\nas the typical 20- or 25-year initial term expires on individual Customer Agreements.\nDeferred Grants\nDeferred grants consist of U.S. Treasury grants and state tax credits. The Company applied for a renewable\nenergy technologies income tax credit offered by one of the states in the form of a cash payment and deferred the\ntax credit as a grant on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records the grants as deferred grants and\nrecognizes the benefit on a straight-line basis over the estimated depreciable life of the associated assets as a\nreduction in Cost of customer agreements and incentives.\nWarranty Accrual\nThe Company accrues warranty costs when revenue is recognized for solar energy systems sales, based on\nthe estimated future costs of meeting its warranty obligations. Warranty costs primarily consist of replacement costs\nfor supplies and labor costs for service personnel since warranties for equipment and materials are covered by the\noriginal manufacturer’s warranty (other than a small deductible in certain cases). As such, the warranty reserve is\nimmaterial in all periods presented. The Company makes and revises these estimates based on the number of solar\nenergy systems under warranty, the Company’s historical experience with warranty claims, assumptions on\nwarranty claims to occur over a systems’ warranty period and the Company’s estimated replacement costs. A\nwarranty is provided for solar systems sold and leased. However, for the solar energy systems under Customer\nAgreements, the Company does not accrue a warranty liability because those systems are owned by consolidated\nsubsidiaries of the Company. Instead, any repair costs on those solar energy systems are expensed when they are\nincurred as a component of customer agreements and incentives costs of revenue.\nSolar Energy Performance Guarantees\nThe Company guarantees to customers certain specified minimum solar energy production output for solar\nfacilities over the initial term of the Customer Agreements. The Company monitors the solar energy systems to\ndetermine whether these specified minimum outputs are being achieved. Annually or every two years, depending on\nthe terms of the Customer Agreement, the Company will refund a portion of electricity payments to a customer if the\nsolar energy production output was less than the performance guarantee. The Company considers this a variable\ncomponent that offsets the transaction price.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the\nfair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income if a derivative\nis designated as part of a hedge transaction. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is immediately recognized\nin earnings and is included in other income (expenses), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to\ninterest rate risks on its syndicated term loans, which are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. On\nthe date that the Company enters into a derivative contract, the Company formally documents all relationships\nbetween the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for\nundertaking each hedge transaction. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure\nto variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow\nhedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance\nsheet as either a freestanding asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and\nqualifies as an effective cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, until\nearnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged item. Any derivative gains and losses that are not\neffective in hedging the variability of expected cash flows of the hedged item or that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting treatment are recognized directly into income. At the hedge’s inception and at least quarterly thereafter,\na formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in cash flows of the derivative instrument have\nbeen highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to\n91\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nbe highly effective in the future. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (i) it determines\nthat the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative\nexpires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or (iii) management determines that designating the derivative as a\nhedging instrument is no longer appropriate. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the\nderivative remains outstanding, the derivative instrument is carried at its fair market value on the balance sheet with\nthe changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings. The remaining balance in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income associated with the derivative that has been discontinued is not recognized in the income\nstatement unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. Such amounts are recognized in\nearnings when earnings are affected by the hedged transaction.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price\nthat would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses valuation\napproaches to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The FASB establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:\n• Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the\nmeasurement date;\n• Level 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\nliabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not\nactive, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n• Level 3—Inputs that are unobservable, significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities and are supported by little or no market data.\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses,\ndistributions payable to noncontrolling interests, derivatives, contingent consideration, and recourse and non-\nrecourse debt.\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair\nvalue on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets\ncan include goodwill that is written down to fair value when it is impaired, which uses level 3 inputs. Assets that are\nwritten down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment\noccurs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an\namount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nCustomer agreements and incentives\nCustomer agreements and incentives revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from Customer\nAgreements in which the Company provides continuous access to a functioning solar energy system and revenue\nfrom the sales of SRECs generated by the Company’s solar energy systems to third parties.\nThe Company begins to recognize revenue on Customer Agreements when permission to operate (\"PTO\")\nis given by the local utility company or on the date daily operation commences if utility approval is not required.\nRevenue recognition does not necessarily follow the receipt of cash. For Customer Agreements that include a fixed\nfee per month which entitles the customer to any and all electricity generated by the system, and for which the\nCompany’s obligation is to provide continuous access to a functioning solar energy system, the Company\nrecognizes revenue evenly over the time that it satisfies its performance obligations, which is over the initial term of\nthe Customer Agreements. For Customer Agreements that charge a fixed price per kilowatt hour, and for which the\nCompany’s obligation is the provision of electricity from a solar energy system, revenue is recognized based on the\nactual amount of power generated at rates specified under the contracts. Customer Agreements typically have an\n92\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\ninitial term of 20 or 25 years. After the initial contract term, Customer Agreements typically automatically renew\nannually or for five years.\nSREC revenue arises from the sale of environmental credits generated by solar energy systems and is\ngenerally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty or upon reporting of the electricity generation.\nFor pass-through financing obligation Funds, the value attributable to the monetization of Commercial ITCs are\nrecognized in the period a solar energy system is granted PTO - see Note 12, Pass-Through Financing Obligations.\nIn determining the transaction price, the Company adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the\neffects of the time value of money when the timing of payments provides it with a significant benefit of financing the\ntransfer of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing\ncomponent. When adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component, the\nCompany uses the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the entity and\nits customer at contract inception and recognizes the revenue amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the\nCustomer Agreement, and interest expense using the effective interest rate method.\nConsideration from customers is considered variable due to the performance guarantee under Customer\nAgreements and liquidating damage provisions under SREC contracts in the event minimum deliveries are not\nachieved. Performance guarantees provide a credit to the customer if the system's cumulative production, as\nmeasured on various PTO anniversary dates, is below the Company's guarantee of a specified minimum. Revenue\nis recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur.\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract in Other Assets in the consolidated\nbalance sheets. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the Customer Agreements,\nand are included in Sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSolar energy systems and product sales\nFor solar energy systems sold to customers, revenue is recognized when the solar energy system passes\ninspection by the authority having jurisdiction, which inspection generally occurs after installation but prior to PTO,\nat which time the Company has met the performance obligation in the contract. For solar energy system sales that\ninclude delivery obligations up until interconnection to the local power grid with permission to operate, the Company\nrecognizes revenue at PTO. Certain solar energy systems sold to customers include fees for extended warranty\nand maintenance services. These fees are recognized over the life of the service agreement. The Company’s\ninstallation Projects are typically completed in less than twelve months.\nProduct sales consist of solar panels, racking systems, inverters, other solar energy products sold to\nresellers, roofing repair, and customer leads. Product sales revenue is recognized at the time when control is\ntransferred, upon shipment, or as services are delivered. Customer lead revenue, included in product sales, is\nrecognized at the time the lead is delivered.\nTaxes assessed by government authorities that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions are\nexcluded from solar energy systems and product sales.\nCost of Revenue\nCustomer agreements and incentives\nCost of revenue for customer agreements and incentives is primarily comprised of (1) the depreciation of the\ncost of the solar energy systems, as reduced by amortization of deferred grants, (2) solar energy system operations,\nmonitoring and maintenance costs including associated personnel costs, and (3) allocated corporate overhead\ncosts.\nSolar energy systems and product sales\nCost of revenue for solar energy systems and non-lead generation product sales consist of direct and indirect\nmaterial and labor costs for solar energy systems installations and product sales. Also included are engineering and\ndesign costs, estimated warranty costs, freight costs, allocated corporate overhead costs, vehicle depreciation costs\nand personnel costs associated with supply chain, logistics, operations management, safety and quality control.\n93\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nCost of revenue for lead generations consists of costs related to direct-response advertising activities associated\nwith generating customer leads.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses include personnel costs, allocated overhead costs, and other costs\nrelated to the development of the Company’s proprietary technology.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) for its equity incentive plan and\nemployee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation to employees is measured based on the grant date fair\nvalue of the awards and recognized over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in\nexchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award). When determining the grant date fair value of\nstock-based compensation, the Company utilizes the observable closing share price of its stock on the grant date.\nThe Company considers whether any adjustments are needed to the share price to reflect fair value, including in\ninstances where the observable market price does not reflect certain material non-public information known to the\nCompany, but unavailable to marketplace participants at the time the market price is observed. No such\nadjustments were made during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. The Company estimates the\nfair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plans awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-\nvaluation model. Upon completion of the acquisition of Vivint Solar, all outstanding equity awards under Vivint\nSolar's equity incentive plans were automatically converted to Sunrun equity awards with the number of shares\nunderlying such awards (and, in the case of stock options, the applicable exercise price) adjusted based on the\nexchange ratio of 0.55 shares of Sunrun common stock per share of Vivint Solar common stock and the fair value\nwas also updated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. Compensation cost is recognized\nover the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method for those options expected to vest.\nFor performance-based equity compensation awards, the Company generally recognizes compensation expense\nfor each vesting tranche over the related performance period.\nThe Company also grants RSUs to non-employees that vest upon the satisfaction of both performance and\nservice conditions. For RSUs granted to non-employees that vest upon the satisfaction of a performance condition,\nthe Company starts recognizing expense on the RSUs when the performance condition is met.\nNet (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss)\nincome per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the\neffect would be antidilutive.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent investors’ interests in the net assets of the Funds that the Company has\ncreated to finance the cost of its solar energy systems subject to the Company’s Customer Agreements. The\nCompany has determined that the contractual provisions in the funding arrangements represent substantive profit\nsharing arrangements. The Company has further determined that the appropriate methodology for attributing\nincome and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance\nsheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method.\nUnder the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations reflect changes in the amounts the\ninvestors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual\nagreements of these arrangements, which are based on the investors' tax capital accounts, assuming the net assets\nof these funding structures were liquidated at recorded amounts. The Company’s initial calculation of the investor’s\nnoncontrolling interest in the results of operations of these funding arrangements is determined as the difference in\nthe noncontrolling interests’ claim under the HLBV method at the start and end of each reporting period, after taking\ninto account any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the Fund and the investors.\n94\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nThe Company classifies certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within the\ncontrol of the Company outside of permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests are reported using the greater of their carrying value as determined by the HLBV method or their estimated\nredemption value at each reporting date.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of\nevents that have been included in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns. Under this method,\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to\nreverse. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not\nthat the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes, which establishes consistent thresholds as it relates to accounting for income taxes. It defines the\nthreshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more likely than not” to\nbe sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not\ncriterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Management has analyzed the\nCompany’s inventory of tax positions with respect to all applicable income tax issues for all open tax years (in each\nrespective jurisdiction).\nThe Company sells solar energy systems to the Funds. As the Funds are consolidated by the Company, the\ngain on the sale of the solar energy systems is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. However,\nthis gain is recognized for tax reporting purposes. The Company accounts for the income tax consequences of\nthese intra-entity transfers, both current and deferred, as a component of income tax expense and deferred tax\nliability, net during the period in which the transfers occur.\nThe Company accounts for investment tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which\nthe credits arise (i.e. the flow-through method).\nThe Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the\nnormal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions, where\napplicable. The statute of limitations for the tax returns varies by jurisdiction.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily\nof cash and accounts receivable, which includes rebates receivable. The associated risk of concentration for cash is\nmitigated by banking with institutions with high credit ratings. At certain times, amounts on deposit exceed Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Company does not require collateral or other security to\nsupport accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, management performs periodic credit evaluations and ongoing\nevaluations of its customers’ financial condition. Rebates receivable are due from various states and local\ngovernments as well as various utility companies. The Company considers the collectability risk of such amounts to\nbe low. The Company is not dependent on any single customer. The Company’s customers under Customer\nAgreements are primarily located in California, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Illinois and\nMassachusetts. The loss of a customer would not adversely impact the Company’s operating results or financial\nposition. The Company depends on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels and other system components.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the solar materials purchases from the top five suppliers\nwere approximately $561.6 million and $747.1 million, respectively.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2021:\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, which\npermits entities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and\ncertain hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform. This ASU is effective upon issuance and can\n95\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\ngenerally be applied through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021,\nand there was no impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which simplifies the\naccounting for income taxes, primarily by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021, and there was no impact to its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options\n(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments and the application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an\nentity’s own equity. This ASU is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company\nadopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021, and applied this guidance to the convertible senior notes issued in\nJanuary 2021, see Note 10, Indebtedness, which allowed the Company to account for the notes and their\nunderlying conversion feature as a liability. There was no other impact to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements as a result of this adoption.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for\napplying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if\ncertain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that\nreference LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.\nThis ASU is available for adoption as of the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020 through\nDecember 31, 2022, as contract modifications or hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December\n31, 2022 are excluded unless an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the\nend of the hedging relationship. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic\n848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December\n31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. For the Company’s cash\nflow hedges in which the designated hedged risk is LIBOR or another rate that is expected to be discontinued, the\nCompany adopted upon issuance of ASU 2020-04 the portion of the guidance that allows it to assert that it remains\nprobable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur. The Company adopted the remainder of this guidance\neffective January 1, 2021, and there was no impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2022:\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract\nliabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured in accordance with FASB ASC Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

Fair Value Measurement\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and\ndistributions payable to noncontrolling interests approximates fair value due to their short-term nature and falls\nunder the Level 2 hierarchy. The carrying values and fair values of debt instruments are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nRecourse debt $ 932,369 $ 844,727 $ 898,040 $ 787,340\nSenior debt 4,114,134 4,082,994 3,238,633 3,176,774\nSubordinated debt 2,219,573 2,131,994 1,743,048 1,625,258\nSecuritization debt 3,405,852 3,191,542 2,519,428 2,169,247\nTotal $ 10,671,928 $ 10,251,257 $ 8,399,149 $ 7,758,619\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of certain recourse debt and certain senior, subordinated and\nsecuritization loans approximate their carrying values because their interest rates are variable rates that\napproximate rates currently available to the Company. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the\nCompany’s other debt instruments are based on rates currently offered for debt with similar maturities and terms.\nThe Company’s fair value of the debt instruments fell under the Level 2 hierarchy. These valuation approaches\ninvolve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price\ntransparency for the instruments or market.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based\nupon the fair value hierarchy are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 132,734 $ — $ 132,734\nTotal $ — $ 132,734 $ — $ 132,734\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 60,401 $ — $ 60,401\nTotal $ — $ 60,401 $ — $ 60,401\n97\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 177,827 $ — $ 177,827\nTotal $ — $ 177,827 $ — $ 177,827\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 8,247 $ — $ 8,247\nTotal $ — $ 8,247 $ — $ 8,247\nThe above balances are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, except for $55.5 million and $55.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its interest rate swaps using a discounted cash flow model that\nincorporates an assessment of the risk of non-performance by the interest rate swap counterparty and an evaluation\nof the Company’s credit risk in valuing derivative instruments. The valuation model uses various inputs including\ncontractual terms, interest rate curves, credit spreads and measures of volatility.\nNote 4.

The Company recorded depreciation expense related to solar energy\nsystems of $500.6 million, $426.7 million and $368.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The depreciation expense was reduced by the amortization of deferred grants of $8.2 million,\n$8.3 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n98\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nNote 6.

Goodwill, net\nThe goodwill was acquired as part of the acquisition of Mainstream Energy Corporation, which included AEE\nSolar and its racking business SnapNrack; Clean Energy Experts, LLC; Omni Energy, LLC; and Vivint Solar.\nThe Company has determined that it has one reporting unit and performs its annual impairment test of\ngoodwill on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would indicate\nthat goodwill might be impaired. During the third quarter of 2023, due to the continued material sustained decline in\nthe Company’s market capitalization after consideration of a control premium below the book value of equity, the\nCompany performed an interim quantitative assessment as of September 30, 2023 related to the recoverability of its\ngoodwill for its one reporting unit. As of September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that the fair value of the\nCompany’s one reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value with consideration of a control premium and\nrecorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1.2 billion in its consolidated statements of operations. There\nwere no such impairments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of October 1, 2023, the\nCompany conducted its annual goodwill impairment test. The test concluded that no additional impairment had\noccurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. To corroborate this conclusion, the Company compared the carrying\nvalue of its one reporting unit to its enterprise market capitalization after consideration of a reasonable control\npremium and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe change in the carrying value of goodwill is as follows (in millions):\nBalance—January 1, 2023, 2022 and 2021 $ 4,280\nImpairment—September 30, 2023 (1,158)\nBalance—December 31, 2023 $ 3,122\n99\nNote 8. Other Assets\nOther assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCosts to obtain contracts - customer agreements $ 1,565,098 $ 1,096,346\nCosts to obtain contracts - incentives 2,481 2,481\nAccumulated amortization of costs to obtain contracts (168,564) (112,968)\nUnbilled receivables 468,379 324,385\nAllowance for credit loss on unbilled receivables (4,774) (3,322)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 91,635 104,759\nEquity investment 132,563 186,197\nOther assets 180,834 237,167\nTotal $ 2,267,652 $ 1,835,045\nThe Company recorded amortization of costs to obtain contracts of $56.3 million and $38.7 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nThe majority of unbilled receivables arise from fixed price escalators included in the Company's long-term\nCustomer Agreements. The escalator is included in calculating the total estimated transaction value for an individual\nCustomer Agreement. The total estimated transaction value is then recognized over the term of the Customer\nAgreement. The amount of unbilled receivables increases while billings for an individual Customer Agreement are\nless than the revenue recognized for that Customer Agreement. Conversely, the amount of unbilled receivables\ndecreases once the billings become higher than the amount of revenue recognized in the period. At the end of the\ninitial term of a Customer Agreement, the cumulative amounts recognized as revenue and billed to date are the\nsame, therefore the unbilled receivable balance for an individual Customer Agreement will be zero. The Company\napplies an estimated loss-rate in order to determine the current expected credit loss for unbilled receivables. The\nestimated loss-rate is determined by analyzing historical credit losses, residential first and second mortgage\nforeclosures and consumers' utility default rates, as well as current economic conditions. The Company reviews\nindividual customer collection status of electricity billings to determine whether the unbilled receivables for an\nindividual customer should be written off, including the possibility of a service transfer to a potential new\nhomeowner.\nNote 9.

Borrowings under the Facility may be designated as Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans,\nsubject to certain terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement. Base Rate Loans accrue interest at a\nrate per year equal to 2.25% plus the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the interest rate\ndetermined from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate and notified to the Company, (c) the\nAdjusted Term SOFR Rate (defined below) for a one-month interest period in effect on such day (or if such\nday is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% and (d) 0.00%. Term SOFR\nLoans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) 3.25% plus (b) the greater of (i) 0.00% and (ii) the sum\nof (x) the forward-looking term rate for a period comparable to the applicable available tenor based on SOFR\nthat is published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Ltd or a successor for the applicable interest\nperiod and (y) (1) if the applicable interest period is one month, 0.11448%, (2) if the applicable interest period\nis three months, 0.26161% or (c) if the applicable interest period is six months, 0.42826% (the rate pursuant\nto clause (b), the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”). This facility is subject to various restrictive covenants, such as\nthe completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements, maintaining a minimum\nmodified interest coverage ratio, a minimum modified current ratio, a maximum modified leverage ratio, and a\nminimum unencumbered cash balance, in each case, tested quarterly. The Company was in compliance with\nall debt covenants as of December 31, 2023. In February 2024, the Company extended its working capital\n101\nfacility with a new maturity date of November 1, 2025 and a total commitment up to $447.5 million, and repaid\napproximately $152.3 million in outstanding borrowings. The maturity date can be further extended to March\n2027, if the Company meets certain liquidity tests as of September 30, 2024.\n(5) These convertible senior notes (\"Notes\") will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the notes\nwill not accrete. The Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances relating to the Company’s\nfailure to comply with its reporting obligations under the Indenture or if the Notes are not freely tradeable as\nrequired by the Indenture. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased by the\nCompany, redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms. The initial conversion rate of the\nNotes is 8.4807 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, per $1,000 principal\namount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $117.91 per share. The\nconversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be\nadjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole\nfundamental change or an issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances,\nincrease the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in\nconnection with such make-whole fundamental change or notice of redemption. The debt discount recorded\non the Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 0.57%. As of December 31,\n2023, $6.6 million of the debt discount was amortized to interest expense inception to date. In connection with\nthe offering of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (“Capped\nCalls”) with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates at a cost of approximately $28.0\nmillion. The Capped Calls are classified as equity and were recorded to additional paid-in-capital within\nstockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2021. The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately\n$117.91 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the\nNotes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $157.22 per share. The Capped Calls cover, subject to\nanti-dilution adjustments, approximately 3.4 million shares of Common Stock. The Capped Calls are expected\ngenerally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset\nany cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Notes, as the\ncase may be, in the event the market price per share of common stock, as measured under the Capped Calls,\nis greater than the strike price of the Capped Call, with such offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market\nprice per share of the common stock, as measured under the Capped Calls, exceeds the cap price of the\nCapped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in\neach case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. The\nfinal components of the Capped Calls are scheduled to expire on January 29, 2026. None of the conversion\ncriteria has been met as of December 31, 2023.\n(6) Certain loans under this category are part of project equity transactions.\n(7) Pursuant to the terms of the aggregation facilities within this category the Company may draw up to an\naggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion in revolver borrowings depending on the available borrowing base\nat the time. In February 2024, the Company increased the size of the facilities within this category to\n$2.35 billion and extended the maturity date to April 2028.\n(8) A loan under this category with an outstanding balance of $140.0 million as of December 31, 2023 contains a\nput option that can be exercised beginning in 2036 that would require the Company to pay off the entire loan\non November 30, 2037.\n(9) Loans under this category with a floating rate had a total outstanding balance of $462.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n(10) As of December 31, 2023, a loan under this category has a balance of $160.6 million with a maturity date of\nApril 2024 and is reflected in Non-recourse debt, current portion within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAlthough there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so, the Company plans to extend or\notherwise refinance the facility prior to maturity.\n(11) As of December 31, 2023, a loan under this category has a balance of $100.0 million with a maturity date of\nApril 2024 and is reflected in Non-recourse debt, current portion within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAlthough there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so, the Company plans to extend or\notherwise refinance the facility prior to maturity.\n(12) As of December 31, 2023, a loan under this category had a balance of $54.2 million with a final rated maturity\ndate of July 2045. Although there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so, the Company plans\nto extend or otherwise refinance the facility prior to anticipated repayment date.\n102\nSenior and Subordinated Debt Facilities\nEach of the Company's senior and subordinated debt facilities contain customary covenants including the\nrequirement to maintain certain financial measurements and provide lender reporting. Each of the senior and\nsubordinated debt facilities also contain certain provisions in the event of default that entitle lenders to take certain\nactions including acceleration of amounts due under the facilities and acquisition of membership interests and\nassets that are pledged to the lenders under the terms of the senior and subordinated debt facilities. The facilities\nare non-recourse to the Company and are secured by net cash flows from Customer Agreements or inventories less\ncertain operating, maintenance and other expenses that are available to the borrower after distributions to tax equity\ninvestors, where applicable. Under the terms of these facilities, the Company's subsidiaries pay interest and\nprincipal from the net cash flows available to the subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all debt\ncovenants as of December 31, 2023.\nNon-Recourse Financings\nIn connection with each of the Company's non-recourse debt (including securitized loans), assets (consisting\nof membership interests in project companies that own photovoltaic systems and related customer agreements)\nwere contributed by the Company to special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (each a “Non-Recourse\nBorrower”). Each of such financings contains customary covenants including the requirement to provide reporting to\nthe indenture trustee or collateral agent and, if applicable, ratings agencies. Each of the financings also contains\ncertain provisions which entitle the indenture trustee or collateral agent to take certain actions upon the occurrence\nof an event of default, including acceleration of amounts due under the facilities and the foreclosure on the assets of\nthe Non-Recourse Borrower that are pledged to the lenders under the terms thereof. The facilities are non-recourse\nto the Company and are secured by first priority security interests by each Non-Recourse Borrower in favor of the\nindenture trustee or collateral agent in all of the Non-Recourse Borrower’s assets including the cash flows from\nCustomer Agreements which are available to each Non-Recourse Borrower after giving effect to certain operating,\nmaintenance and other expenses and, where applicable, distributions to tax equity investors. As a result of such\nsecurity interests, the assets of each Non-Recourse Borrower are not available to the creditors of the Company\nunless and until distributions from such entities are made to the Company as permitted under the applicable facility\ndocumentation. Under the terms of these financings, each Non-Recourse Borrower pays interest and principal from\nsuch net cash flows. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nMaturities of Indebtedness\nThe aggregate future principal payments for debt as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 557,202\n2025 2,513,711\n2026 1,261,096\n2027 876,062\n2028 226,540\nThereafter 5,322,663\nSubtotal 10,757,274\nDebt discount, net (85,346)\nTotal $ 10,671,928\nNote 11. Derivatives\nInterest Rate Swaps\n103\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest payments due on certain of its term loans\nand aggregation facility. These swaps allow the Company to incur fixed interest rates on these loans and receive\npayments based on variable interest rates with the swap counterparty based on SOFR (daily, one month, three\nmonth) on the notional amounts over the life of the swaps. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into\nbilateral agreements with its swap counterparties to transition the remaining portion of its swaps to SOFR. The\nCompany made various elections under FASB ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform, related to changes in\ncritical terms of the hedging relationships due to reference rate reform to not result in a de-designation of these\nhedging relationships. As of September 30, 2023, all of the Company's interest rate swap agreements were indexed\nto SOFR.\nThe interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. The credit risk adjustment associated\nwith these swaps is the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts. In the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the hedge relationships on the Company’s interest rate swaps have been assessed as highly\neffective as the quarterly assessment performed determined changes in cash flows of the derivative instruments\nhave been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged items, are expected to be highly\neffective in the future and the critical terms of the interest rate swaps match the critical terms of the underlying\nforecasted hedged transactions. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes. Changes in the fair value of these\nderivatives are subsequently reclassified into earnings, and are included in interest expense, net in the Company’s\nstatements of operations, in the period that the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings. To the extent that\nthe hedge relationships are not effective, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other\nexpense (income), net in the Company's statements of operations on a prospective basis.\nThe Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain\nconditions. When those conditions are met, the Company presents derivatives at net fair value. As of December 31,\n2023, the information related to these offsetting arrangements were as follows (in thousands):\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset Net Amounts of Assets /\nInstrument Recognized in the Consolidated Liabilities Included in the Notional\nDescription Assets / Liabilities Balance Sheet Consolidated Balance Sheet Amount (1)\nAssets:\nDerivatives\ndesignated as\nhedging\ninstruments $ 97,321 $ (5) $ 97,316 $ 1,416,686\nDerivatives not\ndesignated as\nhedging\ninstruments 35,413 (5,246) 30,167 1,695,495\nTotal derivative\nassets 132,734 (5,251) 127,483 3,112,181\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives\ndesignated as\nhedging\ninstruments (5,963) 5 (5,958) 324,042\nDerivatives not\ndesignated as\nhedging\ninstruments (54,438) 5,246 (49,192) 809,785\nTotal derivative\nliabilities (60,401) 5,251 (55,150) 1,133,827\nTotal derivative\nassets &\nliabilities $ 72,333 $ — $ 72,333 $ 4,246,008\n104\n(1) Comprised of 79 interest rate swaps which effectively fix the SOFR portion of interest rates on outstanding\nbalances of certain loans under the senior and securitized sections of the debt footnote table (see Note 10,\nIndebtedness) at 0.31% to 4.53% per annum.

There were forty-four undesignated\nderivative instruments recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 12. Pass-Through Financing Obligations\nThe Company's pass-through financing obligations (\"financing obligations\") arise when the Company leases\nsolar energy systems to Fund investors who are considered commercial customers under a master lease\nagreement, and these investors in turn are assigned the Customer Agreements with customers. The Company\nreceives all of the value attributable to the accelerated tax depreciation and some or all of the value attributable to\nthe other incentives. Given the assignment of operating cash flows, these arrangements are accounted for as\nfinancing obligations. The Company also sells the rights and related value attributable to the Commercial ITC to\nthese investors.\nUnder these financing obligation arrangements, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company finance the cost\nof solar energy systems with investors for an initial term of 22 years, and one fund for 7 years. The solar energy\nsystems are subject to Customer Agreements with an initial term of typically 20 or 25 years that automatically renew\nannually or for five years. These solar energy systems are reported under the line item solar energy systems, net in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the cost of the solar energy systems placed\nin service under the financing obligation arrangements was $692.3 million and $699.5 million, respectively. The\naccumulated depreciation related to these assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $191.5 million and\n$167.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company retired one of its financing\nobligations and terminated the associated lease for $18.1 million, which resulted in a debt extinguishment expense\nof $6.3 million.\nThe investors make a series of large up-front payments and, in certain cases, subsequent smaller quarterly\npayments (lease payments) to the subsidiaries of the Company. The Company accounts for the payments received\nfrom the investors under the financing obligation arrangements as borrowings by recording the proceeds received\nas financing obligations on its consolidated balance sheets, and cash provided by financing activities in its\nconsolidated statements of cash flows. These financing obligations are reduced over a period of approximately 22\nyears, or over 7 years in the case of one fund, by customer payments under the Customer Agreements, and\nproceeds from the contracted resale of SRECs as they are received by the investor. In addition, funds paid for the\nCommercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and recognized as revenue as the\nassociated solar energy system reaches PTO. The Commercial ITC value is reflected in cash provided by\n106\noperations on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for the Customer Agreements, as\nwell as the resale of SRECs consistent with the Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies as described in\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nInterest is calculated on the financing obligations using the effective interest rate method. The effective\ninterest rate, which is adjusted on a prospective basis, is the interest rate that equates the present value of the\nestimated cash amounts to be received by the investor over the lease term with the present value of the cash\namounts paid by the investor to the Company, adjusted for amounts received by the investor. The financing\nobligations are nonrecourse once the associated assets have been placed in service and all the contractual\narrangements have been assigned to the investor.\nUnder the majority of the financing obligations, the investor has a right to extend its right to receive cash\nflows from the customers beyond the initial term in certain circumstances. Depending on the arrangement, the\nCompany has the option to settle the outstanding financing obligation on the ninth or eleventh anniversary of the\nFund inception at a price equal to the higher of (a) the fair value of future remaining cash flows or (b) the amount\nthat would result in the investor earning their targeted return. In several of these financing obligations, the investor\nhas an option to require repayment of the entire outstanding balance on the tenth anniversary of the Fund inception\nat a price equal to the fair value of the future remaining cash flows.\nUnder the majority of the financing obligations, the Company is responsible for services such as warranty\nsupport, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting to customers. As part of the warranty and\nperformance guarantee with the customers in applicable funds, the Company guarantees certain specified minimum\nannual solar energy production output for the solar energy systems leased to the customers, which the Company\naccounts for as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n107\nNote 13. VIE Arrangements\nThe Company consolidated various VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Stock-Based Compensation\n2013 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn July 2013, the Board of Directors approved the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (“2013 Plan”). In March 2015,\nthe Board of Directors authorized an additional 3,000,000 shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan. An\naggregate of 4,500,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan plus (i) any shares\nthat were reserved but not issued under the plan that was previously in place, and (ii) any shares subject to stock\noptions or similar awards granted under the plan that was previously in place that expire or otherwise terminate\nwithout having been exercised in full and shares issued that are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, with\nthe maximum number of shares to be added to the 2013 Plan pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) equal to 8,044,829\nshares. Stock options granted to employees generally have a maximum term of ten-years and vest over a four-year\nperiod from the date of grant; 25% vest at the end of one year, and 75% vest monthly over the remaining three\nyears. The options may include provisions permitting exercise of the option prior to full vesting. Any unvested shares\nshall be subject to repurchase by the Company at the original exercise price of the option in the event of a\ntermination of an optionee’s employment prior to vesting. All the remaining shares that were available for future\ngrants under the 2013 Plan were transferred to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”) at the inception of the\n2015 Plan.\nSunrun-VSI 2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nUpon completion of the Merger, the Company may grant equity awards through the Sunrun-VSI 2014 Equity\nIncentive Plan (“Sunrun-VSI 2014 Plan”), which was previously called the Vivint Solar 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.\nUnder the Sunrun-VSI 2014 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights, performance stock units, performance shares and performance awards to its\nemployees, directors and consultants, and its parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees and consultants.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 5.7 million shares of common stock were available for grant under the\nSunrun-VSI 2014 Plan, subject to adjustment in the case of certain events. In addition, any shares that otherwise\nwould be returned to the Omnibus Plan (as defined below) as the result of the expiration or termination of stock\noptions may be added to the Sunrun-VSI 2014 Plan. The number of shares available to grant under the Sunrun-VSI\n2014 Plan is subject to an annual increase on the first day of each year.\nLong-term Incentive Plan\n109\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nIn July 2013, Vivint Solar’s board of directors approved shares of common stock for six Long-term Incentive\nPlan Pools (“LTIP Pools”) that comprise the 2013 Long-term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”). Participants in the LTIP are\nallocated a portion of the LTIP Pools relative to the performance of other participants on a measurement date that is\ndetermined once performance conditions are met. The Merger Agreement provided that the LTIP awards\noutstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date were canceled and terminated and that subsequent to the Closing\nDate, each holder of a canceled LTIP award would be granted an RSU award to be settled in shares of Sunrun\ncommon stock, with the number of shares underlying such award calculated as if the LTIP performance hurdles\nwere achieved, with the Closing Date as the determination date. As a result, approximately 1.5 million shares of the\nCompany common stock were awarded as RSUs to LTIP participants with a grant date equal to the Closing Date.\nThese RSUs vest in three equal installments, subject to the grantee’s continued provision of services to the\nCompany. One-third vested 30 days after the Closing Date, one-third vested nine months after the Closing Date,\nand one-third vested 18 months after the Closing Date. As of December 31, 2023, there are no remaining shares\navailable for grant under the LTIP.\n2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn July 2015, the Sunrun Board approved the 2015 Plan.

In 2023 and 2022, there were no additional shares reserved\nfor issuance under the 2015 Plan pursuant to the automatic provision. Stock options granted to employees generally\nhave a maximum term of ten-years and vest over a four-year period from the date of grant; 25% vest at the end of\none year, and 75% vest monthly over the remaining three years. The options may include provisions permitting\nexercise of the option prior to full vesting.

The total intrinsic value of the options\nexercised during the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $10.3 million, $30.8 million and $106.1\nmillion, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference of the current fair value of the stock and the\nexercise price for in-the-money stock options. The total fair value of options vested during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $11.8 million, $16.7 million and $36.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on their grant date using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. The Company estimates the fair value using a single-option approach and amortizes the fair\nvalue on a straight-line basis for options expected to vest. All options are amortized over the requisite service\nperiods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of stock options with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free interest rate N/A 1.60% - 3.80% 0.90% - 1.30%\nVolatility N/A 65.60% - 69.40% 63.00% - 67.80%\nExpected term (in years) N/A 6.10 6.00 - 6.10\nExpected dividend yield N/A — % — %\nThe expected term assumptions were determined based on the average vesting terms and contractual lives\nof the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a term that\napproximates the expected life of the option grant. No stock options were granted in the year ended December 31,\n2023. For stock options granted in the year ended December 31, 2022, the expected volatility was calculated based\non the Company’s average historical volatilities and for the stock options granted in the year ended December 31,\n2021, the Company considered the volatility data of a group of publicly traded peer companies in its industry. The\nCompany accounts for forfeitures as they occur and, as such, reverses compensation cost previously recognized in\nthe period the award is forfeited, for an award that is forfeited before completion of the requisite service period.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes the activity for all RSUs under all of the Company’s equity incentive plans for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (shares in thousands):\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nShares Value\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2021 4,485 $ 42.73\nGranted 4,500 27.66\nIssued (2,968) 40.31\nCanceled / forfeited (1,475) 35.85\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2022 4,542 31.60\nGranted 7,782 19.04\nIssued (2,835) 27.11\nCanceled / forfeited (1,040) 26.59\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2023 8,449 $ 22.16\nWarrants for Strategic Partners\nThe Company has issued warrants for up to 846,943 shares of its common stock to certain strategic partners\n(calculated using the respective quarter of grant's closing stock price).

During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company\n111\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, $4.3 million and $10.7 million, respectively, under\ntime-based warrants.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company's 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) (as amended in May 2017), eligible\nemployees are offered shares bi-annually through a 24-month offering period which encompasses four six-month\npurchase periods. Each purchase period begins on the first trading day on or after May 15 and November 15 of\neach year. Employees may purchase a limited number of shares of the Company’s common stock via regular\npayroll deductions at a discount of 15% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the\nfirst trading date of each offering period or on the exercise date. Employees may deduct up to 15% of payroll, with a\ncap of $25,000 of fair market value of shares in any calendar year and 10,000 shares per employee per purchase\nperiod. Under the ESPP, 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance to\neligible employees. The ESPP provides for an automatic increase of the number of shares available for issuance\nunder the ESPP on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2016, equal to the least of 5 million\nshares, 2% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding\nfiscal year, or such other amount as may be determined by the Board of Directors. In 2023 and 2022, the Board of\nDirectors did not authorize any additional shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense, including ESPP expenses, in the\nconsolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCost of customer agreements and incentives $ 8,772 $ 9,181 $ 11,469\nCost of solar energy systems and product sales 5,267 9,274 5,775\nSales and marketing 59,026 56,857 104,087\nResearch and development 1,739 2,667 3,806\nGeneral and administration 36,977 32,654 85,863\nTotal $ 111,781 $ 110,633 $ 211,000\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $11.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs was $146.5\nmillion and $142.3 million, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8\nyears. Total unrecognized compensation cost includes the assumed unvested Vivint Solar awards to be recognized\nas stock-based compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. Per FASB ASC Topic 805,\nBusiness Combinations, the replacement of stock options or other share-based payment awards in conjunction with\na business combination represents a modification of share-based payment awards that must be accounted for in\naccordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. As a result of the Company’s issuance of replacement\nawards, a portion of the fair-value-based measure of the replacement awards is included in the purchase\nconsideration. To determine the portion of the replacement awards that is part of the purchase consideration, the\nCompany measured the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards as of the Acquisition\nDate.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has an investment tax\ncredit carryforward of approximately $102.0 million which begins to expire in the year 2033, if not utilized, $0.8\nmillion of California enterprise zone credits which begin to expire in the year 2024, and $1.1 million of other state tax\ncredits which begin to expire in the year 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an investment tax credit\ncarryforward of approximately $87.5 million and California enterprise zone credits of approximately $1.0 million.\nGenerally, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial\nannual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986, as\namended and similar state provisions. The Company performed an analysis to determine whether an ownership\nchange under IRC section 382 had occurred and determined that no ownership changes were identified as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $7.1 million of federal and $7.1 million of state\ncapital loss carryforwards. The Company believes its capital loss carryforwards are not likely to be realized.\nValuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that\nthe deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company’s management considers all available positive and\nnegative evidence including its history of operating income or losses, future reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifference, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. The Company has concluded that it is\nmore likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards\nwill not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $174.3 million on\ncertain deferred tax assets, including those relating to federal and state tax credits and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards, which is an increase of $112.6 million in 2023.\nThe Company sells solar energy systems to investment Funds.

In the\nnormal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions, where\napplicable. The statute of limitations for the tax returns varies by jurisdiction.\nThe Company determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination,\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany uses a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate\nthe tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than\nnot that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or\nlitigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than\n50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company has analyzed its inventory of tax positions with\nrespect to all applicable income tax issues for all open tax years (in each respective jurisdiction).\nThe Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within\nthe provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe IRS is auditing one of the Company’s tax equity investors, relating to an investment fund covered by the\nCompany’s 2018 insurance policy in an audit involving a review of the fair market value determination of solar\nenergy systems. The Company is unable to determine if this audit will result in an adverse final determination at this\ntime.\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S., its territories, and various state\nand local jurisdictions. Due to the Company’s net losses, substantially all of its federal, state and local income tax\nreturns since inception are still subject to audit.\nThe following table summarizes the tax years that remain open and subject to examination by the tax\nauthorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which the Company operates:\nTax Years\nU.S. Federal 2020 - 2023\nState 2019 - 2023\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAs a result of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023, the Company does\nnot expect to pay income tax, including in connection with its income tax provision for the year ended December 31,\n2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax\npurposes of approximately $720.7 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2028 for federal\npurposes and in 2024 for state purposes. In addition, federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards\ngenerated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 total $2.0 billion and $357.1 million, respectively, and\nhave indefinite carryover periods and do not expire.\nNote 18. Commitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $37.0 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of\nunused letters of credit outstanding, which each carry fees of 0.50% - 3.25% per annum and 0.50% - 3.25% per\nannum, respectively.\nGuarantees\n115\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nCertain tax equity funds and debt facilities require the Company to maintain an aggregate amount of $35.0\nmillion of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at the end of each month.\nOperating and Finance Leases\nThe Company leases real estate under non-cancellable operating leases and equipment under finance\nleases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets $ 18,827 $ 15,873 $ 13,358\nInterest on lease liabilities 3,291 1,127 958\nOperating lease cost 34,937 31,966 26,906\nShort-term lease cost 2,025 2,602 4,819\nVariable lease cost 11,516 9,246 7,261\nSublease income (4,667) (3,780) (1,095)\nTotal lease cost $ 65,929 $ 57,034 $ 52,207\nOther information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 39,157 $ 34,233 $ 28,230\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 2,952 896 952\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 23,279 14,146 12,352\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases 21,417 38,543 41,068\nFinance leases 87,726 21,030 11,055\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years):\nOperating leases 4.92 5.26 6.15\nFinance leases 4.07 2.86 2.47\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases 4.4 % 3.8 % 3.8 %\nFinance leases 5.6 % 3.7 % 3.1 %\nFuture minimum lease commitments under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2023 were as\nfollows (in thousands):\n116\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nOperating Sublease Net Operating Finance\nLeases Income Leases leases\n2024 $ 34,171 $ 2,976 $ 31,195 $ 26,389\n2025 29,687 1,459 28,228 24,700\n2026 24,842 975 23,867 23,559\n2027 15,322 838 14,484 19,218\n2028 7,968 — 7,968 7,525\nThereafter 19,808 — 19,808 —\nTotal future lease payments 131,798 6,248 125,550 101,391\nLess: Amount representing interest (13,469) — (13,469) (10,585)\nPresent value of future payments 118,329 6,248 112,081 90,806\nLess: Amount for tenant incentives — — — —\nRevised Present value of future payments 118,329 6,248 112,081 90,806\nLess: Current portion (29,572) (2,976) (26,596) (22,053)\nLong term portion $ 88,757 $ 3,272 $ 85,485 $ 68,753\nPurchase Commitment\nThe Company entered into purchase commitments, which have the ability to be canceled without significant\npenalties, with multiple suppliers to purchase $366.4 million of photovoltaic modules, inverters and batteries by the\nend of the first quarter of 2025.\nWarranty Accrual\nThe Company accrues warranty costs when revenue is recognized for solar energy systems sales, based on\nthe estimated future costs of meeting its warranty obligations. Warranty costs primarily consist of replacement costs\nfor supplies and labor costs for service personnel since warranties for equipment and materials are covered by the\noriginal manufacturer’s warranty (other than a small deductible in certain cases). As such, the warranty reserve is\nimmaterial in all periods presented. The Company makes and revises these estimates based on the number of solar\nenergy systems under warranty, the Company’s historical experience with warranty claims, assumptions on\nwarranty claims to occur over a systems’ warranty period and the Company’s estimated replacement costs. A\nwarranty is provided for solar energy systems sold. However, for the solar energy systems under Customer\nAgreements, the Company does not accrue a warranty liability because those systems are owned by consolidated\nsubsidiaries of the Company. Instead, any repair costs on those solar energy systems are expensed when they are\nincurred as a component of customer agreements and incentives costs of revenue.\nCommercial ITC Indemnification\nThe Company is contractually committed to compensate its investors for any losses that they may suffer in\ncertain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in Commercial ITCs, including any reduction in depreciable\nbasis. Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy\nsystems as assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). The Company set the purchase prices and\nclaimed values based on fair market values determined with the assistance of an independent third-party appraisal\nwith respect to the systems that generate Commercial ITCs (and the associated depreciable basis) that are passed-\nthrough to, and claimed by, the Fund investors. In April 2018, the Company purchased an insurance policy providing\nfor certain payments by the insurers in the event there is a final determination (including a judicial determination)\nthat reduced the Commercial ITCs and depreciation claimed in respect of solar energy systems sold or transferred\nto most Funds through April 2018, or later, in the case of Funds added to the policy after such date. In general, the\npolicy indemnifies the Company and related parties for additional taxes (including penalties and interest) owed in\nrespect of lost Commercial ITCs, depreciation, gross-up costs and expenses incurred in defending such claim,\nsubject to negotiated exclusions from, and limitations to, coverage. The Company purchased similar additional\ninsurance policies in January 2021, October 2022 and May 2023.\n117\nSunrun Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued\nAt each balance sheet date, the Company assesses and recognizes, when applicable, the potential exposure\nfrom this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any audits undertaken by the IRS.\nThe IRS is auditing one of the Company's investors in an audit involving a review of the fair market value\ndetermination of the Company's solar energy systems in the investment fund, which is covered by the Company’s\n2018 insurance policy. If this audit results in an adverse final determination, the Company may be subject to an\nindemnity obligation to its investor, which may result in certain limited out-of-pocket costs and potential increased\ninsurance premiums in the future.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, investigations and administrative proceedings in\nthe ordinary course of its business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it is both probable that the\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. These provisions, if any, are\nreviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal\ncounsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Depending on the nature and timing of any\nsuch proceedings that may arise, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company’s future\nconsolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has from time to time been named as a party to various\nlegal claims, actions, or complaints. While the outcome of these matters cannot currently be predicted with certainty,\nthe Company does not currently believe that the outcome of any of these claims will have a material adverse effect,\nindividually or in the aggregate, on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company accrues for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company\nevaluates the adequacy of its legal reserves based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of\nthe law and assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on available information.\nNote 19.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including\nour Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and\nprocedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e)\nand 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.\nIn connection with that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the\ninformation required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms as of December 31, 2023. The term\n“disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management\nnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the\nevaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered\nby this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\nas defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management used the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), or the\nCOSO framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management believes\nthat the COSO framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation of financial reporting because it is free from\nbias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of our internal control over financial\nreporting, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n120\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited\nby Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn February 16, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to\na syndicated, senior secured credit facility originally entered into with various lenders on April 20, 2021 (the “Initial\nCredit Facility”) which has previously been amended five times (as amended, the “Credit Facility”).
