PANOVA-3 evaluated the use of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \n\n“As a researcher and clinician, I have experienced the challenges of developing treatments in pancreatic cancer. It is exciting to see the PANOVA-3 trial achieve the positive primary endpoint of overall survival, a landmark outcome for this field,” said Vincent Picozzi, M.D., medical oncologist and investigator in the PANOVA-3 trial. “These data for Tumor Treating Fields are very promising, especially in this difficult to treat patient population.” \n\nIn the intent-to-treat population, patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitant with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel had an mOS of 16.20 months compared to 14.16 months in patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone, a statistically significant 2.0-month improvement (hazard ratio=0.819; _P_ =0.039) (N=571). The survival rate benefit for patients treated with TTFields therapy increased over time with a 13% improvement in the overall survival rate at 12 months and a 33% improvement in survival rate at 24 months. TTFields therapy was well-tolerated, and safety was consistent with prior clinical studies. \n\n“PANOVA-3 is the first and only Phase 3 trial to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in overall survival specifically in unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer, and is Novocure’s third positive Phase 3 clinical trial in the last two years,” said Nicolas Leupin, M.D., PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Novocure. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in the trial, and we look forward to sharing the full data at an upcoming medical conference.” \n\n“There are approximately 134,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed annually in China, and this cancer is one of the most challenging to treat globally, with limited effective treatment options and poor survival outcomes,” said Dr. Rafael Amado, M.D., President, Head of Global Research and Development at Zai Lab. “Demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer is an important achievement. We are pleased to have been able to contribute to the PANOVA-3 study, and we look forward to working with Novocure to bring this therapy to patients as soon as possible.” \n\nNovocure plans to file for regulatory approval of TTFields in unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on PANOVA-3 and plans to submit the PANOVA-3 results for presentation at an upcoming medical congress. Zai Lab plans to file for regulatory approval in China. \n\n**About PANOVA-3**\n\nPANOVA-3 is a prospective, randomized open-label, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy used concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, as a first-line treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomized to receive either TTFields therapy concomitant with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. \n\nThe primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, local progression free survival, objective response rate, one-year survival rate, quality of life, pain-free survival, puncture-free survival, resectability rate, and toxicity. \n\nA total of 571 patients were enrolled in the study, randomized 1:1 and followed for a minimum of 18 months. \n\n**About Pancreatic Cancer in China**\n\nPancreatic cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers globally. In China, there were an estimated 134,374 new cases in 2022, and it is now the eighth most common cancer type1. The current median survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is nine to twelve months, and the five-year survival rate was 7.2%2, making it the malignancy with the lowest survival rate in China. \n\n1 Xia C, Dong X, Li H et al.

World J Gastroenterol 2021; 27: 4298-4321. \n\n**About Tumor Treating Fields**\n\nTumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electric fields that exert physical forces to kill cancer cells via a variety of mechanisms. TTFields do not significantly affect healthy cells because they have different properties (including division rate, morphology, and electrical properties) than cancer cells. These multiple, distinct mechanisms work together to target and kill cancer cells. Due to these multimechanistic actions, TTFields therapy can be added to cancer treatment modalities in approved indications and demonstrates enhanced effects across solid tumor types when used with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibition, or targeted therapies in preclinical models. TTFields therapy provides clinical versatility that has the potential to help address treatment challenges across a range of solid tumors. \n\nTo learn more about TTFields therapy and its multifaceted effect on cancer cells, visit[**tumortreatingfields.com**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumortreatingfieldstherapy.com%2F&esheet=54159705&newsitemid=20241202363277&lan=en-US&anchor=tumortreatingfields.com&index=1&md5=cacbfaaba029ca906fcad6fc537340b1)**.**\n\n**About Zai Lab**\n\nZai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) is an innovative, research-based, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company based in China and the United States.

We look forward to launching AUGTYRO by the end of 2024,” said Andrew Zhu, Chief Commercial Officer of Zai Lab. “The addition of AUGTYRO, as well as the renewals of NUZYRA and QINLOCK, further support patient access to these important medications throughout China at more affordable treatment costs for patients and their families.” \n\n“A key part of Zai Lab’s mission is to bring innovative medicines to patients with significant unmet medical needs,” said Josh Smiley, President and Chief Operating Officer of Zai Lab. “We are pleased that we now have six products included in the NRDL, and we will continue our efforts to broaden patient access to our innovative treatments across China. We look forward to continuing to work with the NHSA to improve affordability and accessibility for differentiated innovative treatments in China, with the goal of improving patient lives.” \n\n**About _ROS1_ _+_ NSCLC in China**\n\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type and the leading cause of cancer death in China. There were approximately 1,060,600 new cases and 733,300 cases of deaths from lung cancer in China in 2022.1 NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer, and approximately 70% of NSCLC is locally advanced or metastatic at initial diagnosis. In China, _ROS1_ rearrangements occur in approximately 2% of patients with advanced NSCLC.2\n\n1 _Bingfeng Han , et al. Cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2022. _2 _Zhang, et al. Prevalence of ROS1 fusion in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer, Thoracic Cancer January 2019._\n\n**About AUGTYRO**\n\nAUGTYRO (repotrectinib) is a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets _ROS1_ and _NTRK_ oncogenic drivers. Patients with solid tumors, including NSCLC, harboring _ROS1_ or _NTRK_ gene fusions treated with approved targeted therapies often develop resistance mutations that limit binding of drugs to their target. Ultimately, this leads to shortened duration of response and tumor progression. AUGTYRO is the first next-generation TKI that targets _ROS1_ oncogenic fusions in NSCLC and provides improved durability of benefit, including in metastases to the brain. \n\nIn November 2023, AUGTYRO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic _ROS1_ -positive NSCLC. In May 2024, AUGTYRO was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the same indications. Additionally, in August 2023, the NMPA granted AUGTYRO Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a _NTRK_ gene fusion. \n\nZai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (a Bristol Myers Squibb company) to develop and commercialize AUGTYRO in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau, collectively). Zai Lab expects to commercially launch AUGTYRO in mainland China by the end of 2024. \n\n**About CABP and ABSSSI in China**\n\nCABP is the most common type of pneumonia that is acquired outside of the hospital. It is one of the most common infectious diseases and is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. ABSSSI are bacterial infections of skin and associated soft tissues, such as loose connective tissue and mucous membranes. ABSSSI are common and encompass a variety of disease presentations and degrees of severity. In 2020, the estimated incidence of CABP in mainland China was approximately 10 million patients3, and in 2015, the estimated incidence of ABSSSI was 2.8 million patients4. There are significant unmet needs for broad-spectrum antibiotics addressing multi-drug resistance infections with a favorable safety profile. \n\n3 _Incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in urban China: A national population-based study, 2020. _4 _2015 estimates, Zai Lab analysis._\n\n**About NUZYRA**\n\nNUZYRA (omadacycline), a novel tetracycline-class antibacterial with both oral and IV formulations, is active across a broad spectrum of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and many other pathogens. \n\nThe NMPA approved NUZYRA as a Category 1 innovative drug for both oral and IV formulations for the treatment of CABP and ABSSSI in adult patients, and Zai Lab launched NUZYRA in mainland China for these indications in December 2021. It was included in the NRDL for the treatment of adult patients with CABP and ABSSSI in January 2023 for its IV formulation and in January 2024 for its oral formulation. \n\nZai Lab has an exclusive license from Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired by Novo Holdings A/S) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize NUZYRA in Greater China. \n\n**About GIST in China**\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 30,000 GIST patients are newly diagnosed each year in China. Treatment of GIST remains an important unmet medical need in China as many GIST patients, who initially respond to traditional TKIs, ultimately develop tumor progression due to secondary mutations. \n\n**About QINLOCK**\n\nQINLOCK (ripretinib) is an orally administered switch-control TKI that inhibits KIT and PDGFRA kinases, including wild-type and forms with multiple primary and secondary mutations, by using a dual mechanism of action that regulates the kinase switch pocket and activation loop. \n\nThe NMPA approved QINLOCK in March 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, and Zai Lab launched QINLOCK in mainland China for this indication in 2021. It was included in the NRDL in January 2023 for the treatment for GIST patients who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors in the all-comer setting. \n\nZai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a member of ONO Pharmaceutical) for the development and commercialization of QINLOCK in Greater China. \n\n**About Zai Lab**\n\nZai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) is an innovative, research-based, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company based in China and the United States.

Pfizer’s affiliated companies will be exclusively authorized to undertake and perform certain commercialization activities for XACDURO**®** in mainland China. Through this collaboration, Zai Lab will leverage the industry-leading commercialization infrastructure of Pfizer’s affiliated companies in the anti-infective therapeutic area to help accelerate access to this important therapy for patients in need in mainland China. The period of collaboration is for the imported product through November 2028, subject to early termination or extension. \n\nXACDURO® is the only antimicrobial agent specifically developed for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (CRAB)1. It has been approved in the United States and in mainland China for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by susceptible isolates of _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified carbapenem-resistant micro-organisms as an urgent threat2. Globally, _Acinetobacter baumannii_ was among the top six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance in 20193, and CRAB is included in the highest priority category, the Critical Group category, in the list of bacterial priority pathogens published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 20244.In China, _Acinetobacter baumannii_ was the leading cause of death attributable to antimicrobial resistance according to the global burden of disease study 20195 _._ Approximately 300,000 _Acinetobacter baumannii_ isolates were reported in mainland China in 20226.Treatment options for HABP/VABP caused by CRAB infections are limited, and prior to approval of XACDURO®, there remains a lack of gold-standard therapy for CRAB infections7. \n\n“Drug resistance is becoming increasingly serious, with high clinical mortality rate and poor prognosis in critically ill patients, resulting in a serious disease burden. According to recent surveillance data from China8, resistance of _Acinetobacter baumannii_ to the carbapenem class of antibiotics has reached approximately 74%,” said Josh Smiley, President and Chief Operating Officer of Zai Lab. “Zai Lab was instrumental in the development of XACDURO, leading to its approval in China earlier this year. By joining forces with Pfizer, we seek to bring this innovative treatment to Chinese patients more quickly, saving the lives of those most at risk.” \n\n“Pfizer has been deeply engaged in the anti-infective therapeutic area for many years. We have always been committed to addressing the challenges of multiple microbial infections, including bacterial, fungal as well as viral infections, and to reduce the burden of disease on patients,” said Jean-Christophe Pointeau, President of Pfizer China. “The collaboration with Zai Lab will help enable us to work together as we strive to address the growing problem of drug resistance in the treatment of _Acinetobacter baumannii_ , and reflects the new quality productive forces in pharmaceutical companies, helping to achieve the goal of ‘Healthy China’ initiative.” \n\n**About XACDURO ® (sulbactam-durlobactam)**\n\nXACDURO® (sulbactam-durlobactam) is an intravenous drug developed by Entasis Therapeutics Inc., an affiliate of Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics, which is a combination of sulbactam, a β-lactam antibiotic, and durlobactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, or BLI. XACDURO® was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 and China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by susceptible isolates of _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex. \n\nThe NMPA approval is based on positive results from the ATTACK trial ([NCT03894046](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03894046&esheet=54156274&newsitemid=20241121825806&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03894046&index=1&md5=de8b02c1801e1977e31dbc0d63127555)), a global, Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of XACDURO® versus colistin in patients with infections caused by _A. baumannii_. In the pivotal study, XACDURO® demonstrated statistical non-inferiority versus colistin for the primary endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant _Acinetobacter_ infections and a statistically significant improvement in clinical cure rates. XACDURO® was well tolerated and exhibited a favorable safety profile across the clinical program. Zai Lab participated in the global ATTACK study by enrolling patients in China. The Chinese patient cohort data confirm the findings of the global study regarding mortality and clinical response improvement. \n\nZai Lab has an exclusive license to develop and commercialize XACDURO® in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, collectively), Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan from Entasis Therapeutic Inc.\n\n**About Zai Lab**\n\nZai Lab (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) is an innovative, research-based, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company based in China and the United States.
