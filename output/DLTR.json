This holiday season, Coca-Cola is joining our effort to support No Kid Hungry with an additional $100,000 donation to help provide 1 million meals to children. \n\n“We are privileged to work with Share our Strength and the No Kid Hungry campaign in their critical work to solve childhood hunger and poverty in the United States,” said Jennifer Silberman, Chief Sustainability and Impact Officer, Dollar Tree, Inc. “For nearly 15 years, No Kid Hungry has been at the forefront of reversing the growing trend of food insecurity and childhood hunger to help ensure every child has access to the food they need for a happy and healthy future. By ensuring all kids get three meals a day and by helping families access critical programs such as Summer EBT and SNAP benefits, we can end childhood hunger in the United States.” \n\n“We are so grateful to be partnering with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. They are stepping up to help ensure no child experiences hunger,” said Allison Shuffield, Managing Director, Corporate Partnerships, Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Together we can ensure a future where every child has three healthy meals a day, every day.” \n\nAs part of our partnership, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are also supporting the Mayors Alliance to End Childhood Hunger.

(NASDAQ: DLTR) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended August 3, 2024.\n\n“We are encouraged by the continuous progress we are making in the transformation underway at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, despite immense pressures from a challenging macro environment,” said Rick Dreiling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Customers are responding favorably to initiatives like our expanded multi-price offering and we are already seeing a meaningful sales lift at the 1,600 Dollar Tree stores that have been converted to our newest in-line multi-price format. With thousands of stores left to convert, we believe we are still in the very early innings of this rollout, with many years of runway left ahead of us.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Jeff Davis added, “Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 was $0.38 below the midpoint of our previous outlook range. While the vast majority of this variance was attributable to an adjustment of our general liability accrual, a portion was attributable to a comp shortfall which reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of Dollar Tree’s middle- and higher-income customers.”\n\n**Additional Business Highlights**\n\n  * Opened 127 new Dollar Tree and 28 new Family Dollar stores\n  * Approximately 1,600 Dollar Tree stores have been converted to in-line multi-price format\n  * Generated $307 million of net cash provided by operating activities\n  * Repurchased 0.75 million shares for $90.8 million\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Key Operating Results (unaudited)**  \n---  \n_(Compared to same period fiscal 2023)_ |  **Q2****Fiscal 2024** |  **Change**  \nConsolidated Net Sales |  $7.37B |  0.7%  \nSame-Store Net Sales Growth:  \nDollar Tree Segment |  1.3%  \nFamily Dollar Segment |  -0.1%  \nEnterprise |  0.7%  \nOperating Income |  $203.1M |  -29.4%  \nDiluted EPS |  $0.62 |  -31.9%  \nAdjusted Operating Income1 |  $218.1M |  -24.2%  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS1 |  $0.67 |  -26.4%  \n1 |  _Adjustments are for costs related to store closures, Family Dollar Strategic Review professional fees, and severance. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for detailed schedules of these charges._  \n  \n**Second Quarter Results**\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are to the prior year’s second quarter, ended July 29, 2023.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 0.7% to $7.37 billion. Enterprise same-store net sales increased 0.7%, driven by a 1.1% increase in traffic, offset by a 0.5% decrease in average ticket. Dollar Tree same-store net sales increased 1.3%, driven by a 1.4% increase in traffic, offset by a 0.1% decrease in average ticket. Family Dollar’s same-store net sales decreased 0.1%, driven by a 0.7% increase in traffic, offset by a 0.8% decrease in average ticket. Same-store net sales results for the Family Dollar segment do not include any stores that were closed during the second quarter as part of our previously announced portfolio optimization.\n\nGross profit increased 3.7% to $2.21 billion and gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 30.0%. Gross margin expansion was driven primarily by lower freight costs, partially offset by increased sales of higher cost consumable merchandise, higher occupancy costs in the Dollar Tree segment resulting from the loss of leverage from the low single-digit comparable store net sales increase, and higher distribution costs in the Family Dollar segment.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 27.3% of total revenue, compared to 25.3%. The increase was driven primarily by unfavorable development of general liability claims, higher depreciation expense from store investments, temporary labor in the Dollar Tree segment to support our multi-price rollout, higher utilities costs, and loss of leverage from the low single-digit comparable store net sales increase. The increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes costs associated with store closings, costs associated with the strategic review, and severance, selling, general and administrative expenses were 27.1% of total revenue, compared to 25.3%.\n\nOur general liability claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at our stores continue to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle, or litigate the claims. As a result, our actuarially determined liabilities were increased during the second quarter, contributing to incremental general liability claim expenses that adversely impacted our adjusted net income – relative to our earnings outlook provided on June 5, 2024 – by approximately $0.30 per share.\n\nOperating income decreased 29.4% to $203.1 million and operating margin declined 110 basis points to 2.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income decreased 24.2% to $218.1 million and adjusted operating margin declined 90 basis points to 3.0%.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was unchanged at 24.0%. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 24.0%.\n\nNet income was $132.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $143.4 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67.\n\nThe company repurchased 0.75 million shares for $90.8 million, including applicable excise tax.\n\n**Year-to-Date Results**\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are between the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, and the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 2.5% to $15.00 billion. Enterprise same-store sales increased 0.8%. Dollar Tree same-store sales increased 1.5%, driven by a 2.1% increase in traffic, partially offset by a 0.6% decline in average ticket. Family Dollar’s same-store sales were flat and were comprised of a 0.8% increase in traffic along with a 0.8% decline in average ticket.\n\nGross profit increased 4.5% to $4.56 billion and gross margin expanded 60 basis points to 30.4%.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 26.3% of total revenue, compared to 25.0%. On a non-GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.1% of total revenue, compared to 24.8%.\n\nOperating income decreased 11.8% to $623.7 million and operating income margin decreased 60 basis points to 4.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income decreased 11.4% to $653.7 million and operating income margin decreased 60 basis points to 4.4%.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 24.0%. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.6%.\n\nNet income was $432.5 million and diluted EPS was $2.00. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $454.9 million and diluted EPS was $2.10.\n\nThe Company repurchased 3.28 million shares for $403.6 million, including applicable excise tax.\n\n**Strategic Alternatives Review Update**\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business segment, which could include among others, a potential sale, spin-off, or other disposition of the business. There is not a set deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of the strategic alternatives review process, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction or particular outcome.\n\n**Tornado Damage Update**\n\nOn April 28, 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. Based on the significant damage sustained by the facility, the inventory contained in the facility and the facility itself are not salvageable. We incurred losses totaling $117.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, consisting of $70.0 million related to damaged inventory and $47.0 million related to property and equipment. These losses were fully offset by insurance receivables. As of August 3, 2024, we have received insurance proceeds totaling $70.8 million, including $45.0 million related to damaged inventory and $25.8 million related to damaged property and equipment. We expect that the remaining inventory losses and property and equipment losses will be fully offset by insurance recoveries under our distribution center insurance policies.\n\n**Portfolio Optimization Review**\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of the portfolio optimization review, we identified approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. As of August 3, 2024, we have closed approximately 655 stores identified under the portfolio optimization review and expect to close an additional 45 during the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Outlook**\n\n“We are updating our full-year outlook to reflect second quarter results, including the general liability charge, a more conservative sales outlook at Dollar Tree for the balance of the year, and incremental start-up costs associated with the conversion of our recently acquired portfolio of 99 Cents Only Stores leases,” Davis added.\n\nThe Company is adjusting its full-year fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales outlook range to $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion. The Company expects to deliver comparable store net sales growth in the low-single-digits for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments.\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $5.20 to $5.60.\n\nThe revised full-year fiscal 2024 EPS outlook reflects the Company’s second quarter 2024 results, the revised sales outlook, approximately $0.12 of incremental upfront costs associated with the acquisition and re-opening of the acquired 99 Cents Only Stores leases, and approximately $0.12 related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from higher project costs and cadence.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects consolidated net sales for the third quarter will range from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, based on comparable store net sales growth in the low-single-digits for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments.\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter 2024 is estimated to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15.\n\nThe third quarter EPS outlook reflects the revised sales outlook, approximately $0.07 of incremental upfront costs associated with the acquisition and re-opening of the acquired 99 Cents Only Stores leases, and approximately $0.06 related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from higher project costs and cadence.\n\nWhile share repurchases are not included in the outlook, the Company has approximately $952 million remaining under its $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization as of August 3, 2024.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nOn Wednesday, September 4, 2024, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purposes of analyzing operating performance, financial position, liquidity, or cash flows. The non-GAAP financial measures we have disclosed include adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense rate; adjusted operating income (loss); adjusted operating income (loss) margin; adjusted net income; adjusted diluted earnings per share; adjusted effective tax rate; and free cash flow. The Company believes providing additional information in these non-GAAP measures that exclude the unusual expenses described below is beneficial to the users of its financial statements in evaluating the Company's current operating results in relation to past periods. In addition, the Company's debt covenants exclude the impact of certain unusual expenses. The Company has included a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables.  \n1.) | In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million charge to its legal reserve for West Memphis-related matters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, an additional $26.7 million charge was recorded to the legal reserve for these matters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the existing reserve was reduced by $2.5 million based on updated information.  \n2.) | During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. In connection with this portfolio optimization review, we closed approximately 600 Family Dollar stores in the first half of fiscal 2024 and incurred more than $24 million of costs including severance and retention expenses for impacted associates and other related closure costs. This included the closure of approximately 110 Family Dollar stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and more than $6 million of costs incurred.  \n3.) | During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma (\"DC 8\"). We incurred losses for damaged inventory and property and equipment, which are fully insured and therefore not contemplated in the non-GAAP adjustments below. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we incurred $2.2 million of severance-related costs for employees at DC 8.  \n4.) | During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar segment, which could include among others, a potential sale, spin-off or other disposition of the business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we incurred consulting and other expenses totaling $6.2 million related to the strategic review.  \nIn addition, the Company discloses free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company believes free cash flow is an important indicator of our liquidity as it measures the amount of cash we generate from our business operations. Free cash flow may not represent the amount of cash flow available for general discretionary use, because it excludes non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt repayments and required settlements of recorded and/or contingent liabilities not reflected in cash flow from operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables.  \nA reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be recognized. GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as litigation reserves; restructuring charges; goodwill and intangible asset impairments; natural disasters; our store portfolio optimization review and strategic review of Family Dollar, and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.  \n**Reconciliation of Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses** | **13 Weeks Ended** | **26 Weeks Ended**  \n**August 3,2024** | **July 29,2023** | **August 3,2024** | **July 29,2023**  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses (GAAP) |  $ |  2,017.5 |  27.3 |  % |  $ |  1,852.1 |  25.3 |  % |  $ |  3,951.0 |  26.3 |  % |  $ |  3,667.1 |  25.0 |  %  \nDeduct: Store Closure Costs |  (6.6 |  ) |  (0.1 |  %) |  -

Rates under\nContracts\nthese contracts are generally below current spot rates given the state of\n52%\n43%\nglobal freight markets at the time these contracts were executed.\nSpot Rates:\nWe pay current market rates for only a small percentage of the ocean\nfreight capacity that we utilize.\n15\nUpdated Outlook\nThird Quarter and Full-Year Fiscal 2024\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year\nSales - Enterprise $7.4B - $7.6B $30.6B - $30.9B\nComparable Sales - Dollar Tree LSD LSD\nComparable Sales - Family Dollar LSD LSD\nComparable Sales - Enterprise LSD LSD\nNew Store Openings - 600-650\nDepreciation - ~$1.0B\nNet Interest Expense ~$31M ~$110M\nEffective Tax Rate ~24% ~24%\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share $1.05 - $1.15 $5.20 - $5.60\nWeighted Average Number of Shares1 ~216M ~216M\nCapital Expenditures - $1.8B - $1.9B\nLSD = Low Single-Digit (0% to 3%) | MSD = Mid Single-Digit (4% to 6%) | HSD = High Single-Digit (7% to 10%)\nNote: (1) Assumes no incremental share repurchases\n16\nOutlook Details\nFull-Year Fiscal 2024\nUnderlying Factors Impacting FY 2024 Outlook\n Fiscal Year 2024 is a 52-week year and ends February 1, 2025\n Gross Margins\n• Expect full-year gross margin of approximately 36.0% in the Dollar Tree segment\n• Expect full-year gross margin of approximately 25.0% in the Family Dollar segment\n Expect approximately $0.80-$0.90 per share of incremental benefit from reduced freight expenses in FY 2024\n• Given the relatively low level of our freight volume that is subject to spot rates, we believe our exposure to near-term volatility in\nglobal shipping markets is limited and may be partially offset by favorable domestic carrier rates.\n Expect enterprise SG&A expenses to be approximately 26% as a percentage of total revenue\n• Includes general liability cost adjustment taken in Q2\n• Expect SG&A expense for corporate, support, and other to be approximately 1.85% of total revenue\n• Dollar Tree segment SG&A outlook reflects incremental costs to reconfigure stores to expanded multi-price format\n FY 2024 outlook reflects approximately $0.30 of incremental transportation and other costs related to the loss of our Marietta distribution\ncenter, approximately $0.10 of which was realized in the second quarter.\n Expect shrink and mix to be essentially EPS neutral in 2H 2024 as a modest year-over-year tailwind in the Family Dollar banner offsets a\nmodest year-over-year headwind in the Dollar Tree banner.\n FY 2024 outlook assumes approximately $0.15 of EPS benefit, primarily in the second half of the year, from closing underperforming\nFamily Dollar stores.\n FY 2024 outlook does not include any items that are part of our reconciliation between GAAP results and adjusted non-GAAP results.\n17\nAppendix: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFrom time-to-time, the Company discloses certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purposes of analyzing operating performance,\nfinancial position, liquidity, or cash flows. The non-GAAP financial measures we have disclosed include adjusted selling, general and administrative\nexpenses; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense rate; adjusted operating income (loss); adjusted operating income (loss) margin;\nadjusted net income; adjusted diluted earnings per share; adjusted effective tax rate; and free cash flow. The Company believes providing\nadditional information in these non-GAAP measures that exclude the unusual expenses described below is beneficial to the users of its financial\nstatements in evaluating the Company's current operating results in relation to past periods. In addition, the Company's debt covenants exclude the\nimpact of certain unusual expenses. The Company has included a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable\nGAAP measures in the following tables.\n1. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million charge to its legal reserve for West Memphis-related matters. In the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2023, an additional $26.7 million charge was recorded to the legal reserve for these matters. In the first quarter of fiscal\n2024, the existing reserve was reduced by $2.5 million based on updated information.\n2. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved\nidentifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance,\namong other factors. In connection with this portfolio optimization review, we closed approximately 600 Family Dollar stores in the first half of\nfiscal 2024 and incurred more than $24 million of costs including severance and retention expenses for impacted associates and other related\nclosure costs. This included the closure of approximately 110 Family Dollar stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and more than $6\nmillion of costs incurred.\n3. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma (\"DC 8\"). We incurred\nlosses for damaged inventory and property and equipment, which are fully insured and therefore not contemplated in the non-GAAP\nadjustments below. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we incurred $2.2 million of severance-related costs for employees at DC 8.\n4. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar\nsegment, which could include among others, a potential sale, spin-off or other disposition of the business. During the second quarter of fiscal\n2024, we incurred consulting and other expenses totaling $6.2 million related to the strategic review.\n18\nAppendix: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating\nIncome -\nDollar Tree Segment 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, 2024 July 29, 2023 August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023\nOperating income (GAAP) $ 342.0 8.4% $ 397.8 10.3% $ 864.3 10.5% $ 933.5 12.0%\nSG&A adjustments:\nAdd: Severance 2.2 -% - -% 2.2 -% - -%\nTotal adjustments 2.2 -% - -% 2.2 -% - -%\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 344.2 8.4% $ 397.8 10.3% $ 866.5 10.5% $ 933.5 12.0%\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating\nIncome (Loss) -\nFamily Dollar Segment 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, 2024 July 29, 2023 August 3, 2024 July 29, 2023\nOperating income (loss) (GAAP) $ ( 14.6) (0.4%) $ 11.8 0.3% $ 22.3 0.3% $ 20.6 0.3%\nSG&A adjustments:\nAdd: Store Closure Costs 4.8 0.1% - -% 21.6 0.3% - -%\nAdd/Deduct: Legal Reserve - -% - -% ( 2.5) -% 30.0 0.4%\nAdd: Strategic Review Costs 6.2 0.2% - -% 6.2 0.1% - -%\nTotal adjustments 11.0 0.3% - -% 25.3 0.4% 30.0 0.4%\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\n$ ( 3.6) (0.1%) $ 11.8 0.3% $ 47.6 0.7% $ 50.6 0.7%\n(Non-GAAP)\n19\nAppendix: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDiluted net income per share (GAAP) $ 0 .62 $ 0 .91 $ 2.00 $ 2 .26\nSG&A adjustments:\nAdd: Store Closure Costs 0.03 - 0.11 -\nAdd/Deduct: Legal Reserve - - (0.01) 0.14\nAdd: Strategic Review Costs 0.03 - 0.03 -\nAdd: Severance 0.01 - 0.01 -\nTotal adjustments 0.07 - 0.14 0.14\nProvision for income taxes on adjustments (0.02) - (0.04) (0.02)\nAdjusted diluted net income per share (Non-GAAP) $ 0 .67 $ 0 .91 $ 2.10 $ 2 .38\n20"

Business\nOverview\nWe are a leading operator of retail discount stores operating under the brand names of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada. At February 3, 2024, we\noperated 16,774 retail discount stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces. Over the long-term, we believe that the market can support more than 10,000 Dollar Tree\nstores and 15,000 Family Dollar stores across the United States, and approximately 1,000 Dollar Tree stores in Canada. We believe the convenience and value we offer are key\nfactors in serving and growing our base of loyal customers.\nWe operate in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. For discussion of the operating results of our reporting business segments, refer to “Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Segment Information” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nWe execute a dual-banner strategy that aims to offer the best of our brands in various store formats to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. Dollar Tree is the\nleading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the $1.25 price point, with a growing range of additional price points. Dollar Tree stores serve\ncustomers with a broad range of income levels in suburban locations, striving continuously to “Wow” the customer with a compelling, fun and fresh merchandise assortment\ncomprised of a variety of the things the customer wants and needs, all at incredible values in bright, clean and friendly stores. Family Dollar operates general merchandise retail\ndiscount stores providing customers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Family Dollar primarily serves a lower-than-\naverage income customer in urban and rural locations, offering great values on everyday items.\nWe are committed to growing our business through new store openings, expanded geographies, improved product offerings, store renovations and remodeling, investments\nin our workforce and other initiatives to modernize and optimize our stores, our supply chain and distribution network and our technology. These initiatives are discussed\nfurther below and in “Item 7.

Additionally, our people programs, as well as our\nmeaningful focus on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, reinforce our shared values and behaviors. For more information, see the “Our People” section below.\nDollar Tree\nThe Dollar Tree segment includes 8,415 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands, 15 distribution centers in the United States and two in\nCanada as of February 3, 2024. Our stores predominantly range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet. We continue to expand our brand assortment at the $1.25 price point to\nprovide greater value for our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. We are continuing to expand our multi-price product assortment, which began with\nour introduction of $3 and $5 Dollar Tree Plus product in select discretionary categories, expanded into $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a\nwide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product. Through a partnership with Instacart, our customers can shop online and receive same-day delivery from more\nthan 7,500 Dollar Tree stores, as of February 3, 2024, without having to visit a store.\nIn our Dollar Tree Canada stores, we generally sell items for $1.50(CAD) or less. Our revenue and assets in Canada are not material.\nWe strive to exceed our customers’ expectations of the variety and quality of products they can purchase by offering items we believe typically sell for higher prices\nelsewhere. Merchandise imported directly typically accounts for approximately 41% - 43% of our total retail value purchases, with the remaining merchandise purchased\ndomestically. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports and we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from\ndomestic vendors is imported. Our domestic purchases include basic, home, closeouts and promotional merchandise. We believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise\naffords our buyers flexibility that enables them to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations. In addition, direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from\na broad range of products and customize packaging, product sizes and package quantities that best meet our customers’ needs.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe carry approximately 8,000 items in our Dollar Tree stores, and as of the end of fiscal 2023 approximately 27% of our items were automatically replenished. The\nremaining items are either allocated to the stores or managed by direct store delivery (“DSD”) vendors. Through automatic replenishment, store-specific allocations and DSD\nvendors, each store is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base.\nWe maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these with\nseasonal, closeout and promotional merchandise. We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination\nand increase traffic in our stores. Closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10% of our purchases.\nThe merchandise mix in our Dollar Tree stores consists of:\n• Consumable merchandise, which includes everyday consumables such as household paper and chemicals, food, candy, health and personal care products, and in most\nstores, frozen and refrigerated food;\n• Discretionary merchandise, which includes the following:\n◦ Variety merchandise, which includes toys, durable housewares, gifts, stationery, party goods, greeting cards, softlines, arts and crafts supplies and other items;\nand\n◦ Seasonal goods, which include, among others, Christmas, Easter, Halloween and Valentine’s Day merchandise.\nFor information regarding the amounts and percentages of our net sales contributed by the above merchandise categories for the last three fiscal years, please refer toN ote\n13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nFamily Dollar\nThe Family Dollar segment includes 8,359 stores operating under the Family Dollar brand and ten distribution centers as of February 3, 2024. In our Family Dollar stores,\nwe sell merchandise at prices that generally range from $1.00 to $10.00. Historically, our stores have predominantly ranged from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. We are\ncontinuing to implement our store design initiatives at Family Dollar which provide significantly improved merchandise offerings and establish a minimum number of cooler\ndoors. We tailor space and assortment to local demographics with emerging formats including H2.5, our primary store format with 6,700 - 8,700 selling square feet, optimized\nlayout and expanded frozen and refrigerated doors; larger rural stores with more than 8,700 selling square feet and assortments that may include Dollar Tree product; and XSB\n(Extra Small Box), which has less than 6,700 selling square feet and adds elements of H2.5 optimized to our smaller stores, particularly in urban markets. As of February 3,\n2024, our customers can shop online via Instacart and receive same-day delivery from more than 7,300 Family Dollar stores without having to visit a store.\nOur Family Dollar stores provide customers with a quality, high-value assortment of basic necessities and seasonal merchandise. We offer competitively-priced national\nbrands from leading manufacturers alongside name brand equivalent-value, lower-priced private labels. We continue to introduce new private brands at Family Dollar, convert\ncontrol brands to private brands and align our “Family” brand message across key categories. We purchase merchandise from a wide base of suppliers and generally have not\nexperienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of merchandise. In fiscal 2023, we purchased approximately 15% of our merchandise at retail value through our\nrelationship with McLane Company, Inc., which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers. In addition, merchandise imported directly typically\naccounts for approximately 15% - 17% of our total retail value purchases. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports and we\nbelieve that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported.\nWhile the number of items in a given store can vary based on the store’s size, geographic location, merchandising initiatives and other factors, our typical Family Dollar\nstore generally carries approximately 11,800 items, and as of the end of fiscal 2023 approximately 75% of our items were automatically replenished. Across all of Family\nDollar’s formats we are expanding our SKUs, continuing to add cooler doors, increasing our standard shelf profile, and implementing planogram and category resets.\nThe merchandise mix in our Family Dollar stores consists of:\n• Consumable merchandise, which includes food and beverages, tobacco, health and personal care products, household chemicals, paper products, hardware and\nautomotive supplies, diapers, batteries, and pet food and supplies;\n• Discretionary merchandise, which includes the following:\n◦ Home products, which include housewares, home décor, giftware, and domestics, including comforters, sheets and towels;\n◦ Apparel and accessories merchandise, which includes clothing, fashion accessories and shoes; and\n7\nTable of Contents\n◦ Seasonal and electronics merchandise, which includes Christmas, Easter, Halloween and Valentine’s Day merchandise, personal electronics, including pre-paid\ncellular phones and services, stationery and school supplies, and toys.\nFor information regarding the amounts and percentages of our net sales contributed by the above merchandise categories for the last three fiscal years, please refer toN ote\n13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for\nclosure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of this portfolio\noptimization review, we plan to close approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024,\nand approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. Additionally, we identified approximately 30 underperforming Dollar Tree stores for\nclosure and plan to close each store at the end of the store's current lease term. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the store portfolio optimization review.\nMarketing & Retail Media\nWe believe the customer experience is important to the success of our business. Our marketing efforts are focused on providing value to our customers through advancing\nour capabilities and delivering on our brand promise of ‘Helping you do more.’ In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we launched a new app for Family Dollar with the goal of\noffering improved product discovery and engagement with our smart coupon program, as well as to provide opportunities for our vendor partners to market their products\nthrough our app. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement with a NASCAR Cup Series racing team, which will spotlight the\nDollar Tree and Family Dollar brands as well as the brands of our vendor partners.\nPurchasing\nWe believe our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy, which includes targeted\nmerchandise margin goals by category. We leverage our merchandising team to source products that can be sold in both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. We also believe\nour ability to negotiate with our vendor partners enables us to manage the margin impact of economic pressures. We primarily buy products on an order-by-order basis and have\nno material long-term purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost. Historically, no merchandise vendor has accounted for\nmore than 10% of total merchandise purchased by the company.\nDistribution\nA strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a low-cost operating structure. We currently operate 25 distribution centers in the\nUnited States, 15 of which are primarily dedicated to serving our Dollar Tree stores and ten distribution centers serve our Family Dollar stores. New distribution sites are\nstrategically located to reduce the distance between the distribution centers and stores, maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas. In fiscal 2024, we\nexpect to re-open our West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center and to complete a significant expansion of our Ocala, Florida distribution center which will include enhanced\nautomation. We continue to make investments in our trucking fleet and transportation management systems and a new RotaCart delivery process to streamline the truck\nunloading and store delivery process. A RotaCart is a wheeled container that allows quick, easy store deliveries loaded by merchandise family groups. The RotaCarts are\nnestable, allowing for easy return to the distribution centers.\nOur Dollar Tree stores receive approximately 90% of their inventory from our distribution centers and our Family Dollar stores receive approximately 70% of their\ninventory from our distribution centers. The remaining store inventory, primarily perishable consumable items and other vendor-maintained display items, are delivered directly\nto our stores from vendors or third party distributors. Approximately 15% of the merchandise in Family Dollar stores is distributed by McLane Company, Inc. For more\ninformation on our distribution center network, see “Item 2. Properties.”\nDistribution services in Canada are provided by a third party from facilities in British Columbia and Ontario.\nSeasonality\nFor information on the impact of seasonality, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.”\n8\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nWe operate in the discount retail sector, which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality,\nassortment and presentation, and customer service, including merchandise delivery and checkout options. Our competitors include dollar stores, mass merchandisers, online\nretailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, independently-operated discount stores, grocery stores and a wide variety of other retailers. These other retail\ncompanies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. We believe we differentiate ourselves\nfrom other retailers by providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost merchandise in attractively-designed stores that are conveniently located.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations within the United States and Canada. These laws and regulations relate to, among other\nthings, the operation of our facilities and the sale of products, including without limitation product and food safety, marketing and labeling; labor and employment, including\nwage and hour, benefits, healthcare and workplace safety; pricing; antitrust and fair competition; privacy and information security; tariff and trade; energy and environmental\nprotection; financial reporting and disclosure; licensing; intellectual property; and taxes. We routinely incur significant compliance-related costs, both direct and indirect, with\nrespect to these laws and regulations which may have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe are the owners of several trademarks including “Dollar Tree,” the “Dollar Tree” logo, “Family Dollar,” “Family Dollar Stores” and other names and designs of certain\nmerchandise sold in our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. Our trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their\nregistrations are properly maintained.\nOur People\nOur business success, customer satisfaction and employee engagement are built upon our dedicated associates who work and live in the communities we serve. Our goal is\nto provide a work environment that is welcoming and inclusive, offers competitive pay and benefits, supports growth and development, and affirms our corporate values. We\nrecruit and hire in the communities we serve using associate referrals, local job fairs and social media as well as local community service partners to provide part-time and full-\ntime jobs that can become lasting careers. Our Human Resources team, with oversight from our Board of Directors and its committees, develops and executes programs for\ncompensation and benefits, onboarding and training, professional and leadership development, performance management, recognition and succession planning.\nWe show care for our people by investing in their personal well-being and professional growth through a variety of people programs and initiatives, including:\n• Compensation, benefits and well-being. We are committed to providing market-competitive pay for all positions, and we are a pay-for-performance organization,\noffering performance-based compensation opportunities at nearly all levels of the organization, including certain hourly-paid positions. In the last year, we made\napproximately $175.0 million in annualized wage investments across the organization, which includes $60.5 million of statutorily required minimum wage increases.\nWe strive to ensure gender and racial pay equity for associates performing equal or substantially similar work. Eligible associates can participate in our Retirement\nSavings Plan, which provides a dollar-for-dollar match on the first 5% of associate contributions, and all associates can participate in our Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan. All full-time and part-time associates are eligible for health and welfare benefits, including medical, dental and vision. Associates may be eligible for other\nbenefits including educational assistance, disability and life insurance as well as paid maternity and parental leave. Financial support to associates recovering from\nnatural disasters and personal hardships as well as a scholarship program for associates with children pursuing higher education are also available. Associates are\noffered the flexibility to advance their payday earnings to meet their personal bills and expenses.\n• Talent development and retention. We believe in the growth and development of our associates and are committed to building a culture of learning that gives\nassociates the opportunity to enhance their skills at every stage of their career. To support this objective, we provide a multitude of professional and leadership\ndevelopment experiences, including online and instructor-led trainings, tuition reimbursement for graduate, undergraduate, General Educational Development\n(“GED”) and English as a Second Language classes, and discounted tuition at hundreds of colleges and universities for our associates and their families. Retention of\nour associates is a focus for all leaders and we continuously aim to improve our turnover rate. To identify high-potential individuals, leadership assesses talent at the\nstore manager level and above on a regular basis through structured talent reviews and succession planning paired with customized development plans. This focus on\ntalent resulted in more than 48,400 promotions in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023 we also started building our first\n9\nTable of Contents\nleadership academy, focusing on our field district managers and setting the stage for similar programs for other groups of leaders throughout the organization.\n• Diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). We believe our associates should mirror our highly diverse customer base and the communities we serve, and our DEI efforts\nstrive to inspire belonging both inside and outside our company. Our goal is to create and support a culture of inclusion within a diverse workforce where the unique\nskills and perspectives of our associates and customers are understood, respected and appreciated. To further this goal, we have continued to build on our DEI\nExecutive Council comprised of senior leaders from every department. The DEI Executive Council provides strategic and tactical leadership support to our Chief\nDiversity Officer (“CDO”) on all matters related to DEI. The CDO is charged with creating and implementing DEI-focused strategies consistent with our business\ngoals, catalyzing cultural change throughout the organization and driving accountability at the senior management level for progress on key DEI objectives. In\naddition, we provide associate training on DEI topics and have formed a number of associate resource groups (“ARGs”), including: Asian American Pacific Islander\nLeague, Black Advocate Alliance, Champions for Women, Hispanic Heritage Network, Pride, and Veterans Engaging Together in Service. Our objective is to build a\nplatform to encourage professional development, support community outreach, cultivate mentoring, attract diverse talent and promote cross-functional teamwork for\nall associates. Each ARG is supported by a senior executive sponsor who is a member of the DEI Executive Council, an executive leader and a Human Resources\npartner to ensure efforts are aligned with the business.\n• Workplace safety. Safety is a foundational part of our culture, embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Our expanded Asset Protection department, which\nincludes Environmental, Health and Safety and Workplace Violence teams leads our comprehensive safety programming across all areas of our enterprise.\nThroughout the organization, we operate with a commitment to “Safety First, Safety Always,” with the shared understanding that a safe working environment is the\nresponsibility of every associate. Through training and technology, we are able to implement measures that protect our associates and customers, and leverage\npredictive analytics to proactively identify and support stores in need of safety assistance. Furthermore, preventing incidents of workplace violence is a critical aspect\nof our safety program. Our comprehensive workplace violence prevention efforts focus on five foundational areas of training; investigation; response; prevention and\ncommunity outreach.\n• Communication and engagement. We believe that our associates are the most critical part of our business, and supporting an engaging culture where people can do\ntheir best work is a top priority for our leaders. Over the last year we have added new channels to foster two-way dialogue and ensure we are listening to our associates\nand taking action on their feedback. A comprehensive strategic communication plan has been put in place to ensure our associates across the organization hear directly\nfrom our executive leaders on a regular basis to remain aligned with key priorities. And Workplace, our internal communication and collaboration tool introduced in\nfiscal 2023, gives associates a voice as well as visibility into the great work and progress happening across the company. Our annual associate engagement survey and\nsemiannual pulse survey assess and highlight areas of focus that are important to our people, providing managers with quantitative and qualitative feedback directly\nfrom their teams. Our robust associate engagement survey process includes action planning to have meaningful impact on our continued cultural evolution.\nAs of February 3, 2024, we employed more than 211,800 associates, as follows:\nStore and Distribution Center Associates\nStore Support Center\nDollar Tree Family Dollar Associates Total\nFull-time Associates 29,997 32,844 3,053 65,894\nPart-time Associates 101,524 44,403 5 145,932\nTotal 131,521 77,247 3,058 211,826\nPart-time associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week, and the number of part-time associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs.\nWe consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\nAvailable Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\n13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website at www.dollartree.com as soon as reasonably practicable after electronic filing\nof such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\n10\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any failure to meet market expectations, including our comparable store net sales growth rate, earnings\nand earnings per share or new store openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. You should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together\nwith all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes. However, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in our SEC filings. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise. In such event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or\nprospects could be materially adversely affected.\nProfitability and Operational Risks\nOur profitability is vulnerable to increases in merchandise, shipping, freight and fuel costs, wage and benefit and other operating costs.\nFuture increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefit costs, ocean shipping rates, domestic freight costs, fuel and energy costs, duties and tariffs, and\nstore occupancy costs would reduce our profitability. We experienced material increases in wage rates and labor costs as well as in shipping rates, freight and fuel costs in prior\nyears, and we expect further increases in certain cost categories in fiscal 2024. In addition to pressures from a tight labor market, we have incurred additional costs as a result of\nrecent minimum wage increases by certain states and localities, and we expect additional minimum wage increases by states and localities in fiscal 2024. In addition, the federal\nminimum wage may increase depending on the outcome of legislation proposed in Congress, and the current administration has announced it will consider raising the minimum\nsalary for associates who currently have exempt status under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Separately, government or industry actions addressing the impact of climate change,\nor shifts in customer preferences for more sustainable products, or our adoption of goals or initiatives aligned with related stakeholder expectations may result in increases in\nour merchandise or operating costs.\nIn our Dollar Tree segment, we raised our primary price point on merchandise to $1.25 in fiscal 2021. We also continue to implement our multi-price initiative which\nprovides our customers with additional categories priced, for example, at $3, $4 and $5. Although we have increased our price points at our Dollar Tree stores, our ability to\nadjust our product assortment, to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases is critical to maintaining our profitability\nlevels. Supply chain constraints and higher commodity costs could make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of certain products and could negatively affect our\nproduct assortment and merchandise costs. We can give no assurance that we will be able to adjust our product assortment, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable\nstore net sales in the future. Although Family Dollar, unlike Dollar Tree, can more easily raise the price of merchandise, customers may buy fewer products if prices were to\nincrease. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of the effect of economic factors\non our operations.\nHigher costs and disruptions in our distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to import or transport merchandise to our distribution centers and store, pick and ship merchandise to our stores in a safe, timely and\ncost-effective manner, and we are relying on a number of initiatives to improve upon our logistics execution, including new management systems. In addition to our internal\ndistribution network, we also rely heavily on third parties including ocean carriers and truckers. Some of the factors that have had and could have an adverse effect on our\ndistribution network or costs are:\n• Efficient operations and management. Distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are complex and difficult to operate efficiently. If we fail to\nexecute properly, we may not be able to deliver merchandise at the quality and in the quantities and at the times demanded to successfully meet our customers’\ndemand. We have also experienced and could continue to experience challenges in attracting and retaining an adequate and reliable workforce. Although we have\noffered enhanced wages in certain markets to address the shortage of labor at our distribution centers, such measures have increased our costs and are expected to\ncontinue to increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability.\n• Shipping costs. We have previously experienced significant changes in freight costs. Ocean shipping and other freight costs could increase because of shocks or\ndisruptions in the global supply chain and as freight contracts terminate or renew. A significant increase in our freight costs could have a material adverse impact on\nour business and results of operations. A return to more normalized costs/rates may lag a decrease in market rates based on the timing of freight contract terms. We\nhave multi-year contracts expiring in 2025 that cover approximately 54% of our import purchase volume.\n11\nTable of Contents\n• Trucking and diesel fuel costs. We have experienced significant increases in trucking costs in recent years due to a truck driver shortage and other factors. The truck\ndriver shortage also required us to increase our use of more expensive surge carriers to transport our merchandise. We have also experienced volatility in diesel fuel\ncosts and are expecting increases to continue in fiscal 2024 and may worsen, for example, because of the impact of international events such as trade restrictions on\nRussia on oil prices.\n• Shipping disruptions. We have experienced disruptions in the global supply chain, including issues with shipping capacity, port congestion and pandemic-related port\nclosings and ship diversions. In addition, our supply chain may be disrupted because of other international events such as armed conflict, war, economic sanctions or\nacts of terrorism. Current tensions in the Red Sea and traffic restrictions through the Panama Canal are causing global supply chain disruptions that could increase\nocean shipping costs and transit times. Our receipt of imported merchandise has been and may in the future be disrupted or delayed because of these or other factors.\nDelays could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix, overall sales, and merchandise margins, especially at Dollar Tree.\n• Labor disagreement. Labor disagreements, disruptions or strikes, including at ports, rail networks, transportation companies, or other parts of our distribution network\nmay result in lost sales due to shipping delays or disruptions in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase our costs.\n• Vulnerability to natural or man-made disasters, including climate change. A fire, explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution or store support\nfacilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. Some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes, hurricanes,\ntornadoes or floods, and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and patterns may increase our operating costs, disrupt manufacturing or\nour supply chain, change customer buying patterns, result in closures of our stores or distribution and store support centers and impede physical access to our stores.\n• Direct-to-store deliveries. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain consumable merchandise, including frozen and refrigerated products. To the extent that\nsupply chain disruptions and higher costs affect our suppliers, we may be subject to delays or reductions in deliveries and higher costs for merchandise.\nWe may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related or other issues.\nWe may stop selling or recall certain products, including our private label brands, for safety-related or other issues, including product contamination, product content,\nimproper manufacturing or distribution processes, improper testing, product mislabeling or product tampering. We may also stop selling or recall products if the products, the\noperations of our suppliers, or our operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including food, drug and cosmetic safety laws, or raise potential health and safety-related\nissues, including improper storage, product mishandling, contamination or other adulteration, or when products or their contents could cause injury, illness or death. Any recall\nmay require significant management attention, and we could experience significant costs, lost sales, compliance or enforcement actions by governmental authorities which could\nresult in fines or other penalties, and/or product liability legal claims and consumer lawsuits. Recalls may also subject us to public claims of false or deceptive advertising and\nother criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a regulatory enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our\nreputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, any product recall may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring\nfurther management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.\nWe could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending because of concerns about the quality and safety of our products or our brand standards.\nWe could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending if our customers become concerned about the quality and safety of the products we sell. The sale of\nprivate brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans. The sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or\nincreases certain risks, such as: product liability claims and product recalls; disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains; supplier labor and\nhuman rights issues, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. Failure to appropriately address these\nrisks could materially and adversely affect our private brand initiatives, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n12\nTable of Contents\nInflation or other adverse change or downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability.\nA deterioration in economic conditions could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as\nprofitably. Adverse economic conditions such as a recession could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater\nmarkdowns, or reduce our profitability due to lower margins. Other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include inflation, higher\nunemployment, consumer debt levels, trade disputes, as well as adverse climate or weather conditions, worsening or new epidemics, terrorism, or international tensions,\nincluding armed conflict and economic sanctions.\nFurthermore, factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell most profitably. In fiscal 2023,\nwe continued to experience a material shift in consumer purchasing from higher-margin discretionary merchandise to lower-margin consumable goods. Factors that could\nreduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include inflation in food, housing, fuel or other energy costs, increased unemployment,\nincreases in interest rates, lack of available credit, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, increasing healthcare costs, and changes in government subsidies such as\nunemployment and food assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”). If consumer spending on the goods we sell declines as a\nresult, there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nMany of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, also affect our\nability to implement our corporate strategy effectively and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely\naffect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.\nRisks associated with merchandise supply could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are dependent on our vendors, including direct ship vendors, to supply suitable merchandise in a timely and efficient manner at favorable costs. If a vendor fails to\ndeliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties, or if we are unable to source an expanded assortment of appropriate product to meet our merchandising\nstrategies, we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used.\nWe rely on the timely availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices. Merchandise imported directly typically accounts for approximately 41% - 43% of our\nDollar Tree segment’s total retail value purchases and approximately 15% - 17% of our Family Dollar segment’s total retail value purchases. In addition, we believe that a\nsignificant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. Imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and result in higher profit\nmargins. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits. Risks associated with our\nreliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as:\n• duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, including Section 301 tariffs;\n• raw material shortages, work stoppages, government restrictions, strikes and political unrest, including any impact on vendors or shipping arising from epidemics;\n• economic crises in the United States or abroad and international disputes or conflicts, including military confrontation, blockade, war and economic sanctions;\n• changes in currency exchange rates or government policies and local economic conditions, including inflation (including energy prices and raw material costs) in the\ncountry of origin;\n• potential changes to international trade agreements or the failure of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with other countries; and\n• changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and their relations with the United States.\nAmong our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from China or an increase\nin the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits. While the United States scaled back punitive Section 301 tariffs on certain Chinese imports based on an\nagreement reached with China in 2020, the political outlook remains uncertain. The imposition of any new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports or the taking of other actions against\nChina in the future, and any responses by China, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales or an increase in our cost of merchandise,\nwhich would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOur growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.\nExisting store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors, including merchandise quality, relevance and availability, store\noperations and customer satisfaction. In addition, increased competition could adversely affect our sales. We have embarked on several initiatives to increase our sales and\nprofitability, some of which remain in the early stages. At the same time, the company recently concluded a comprehensive performance review of its store portfolio and\nannounced the closure of approximately 970 Family Dollar and 30 Dollar Tree stores. For more information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nExpanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out and open or expand stores in suitable\nlocations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms. We also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw\nsales away from our existing stores. Obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever-increasing challenge.\nIn addition, our expansion is dependent upon the company and its third-party developers’ abilities to acquire land, obtain financing, and secure necessary permits and\napprovals. We have experienced higher commodity and other costs associated with the build-out of new stores and the renovation of existing stores. We have also experienced\ndelays in new store openings and the renovation of existing stores due to inspection, permitting and contractor delays. In addition, we have experienced delays in new store\nopenings due to limitations on the availability of certain fixtures and equipment. We anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future, which\ncould adversely affect our sales and profitability. Further, we may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell.\nOur gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell. For example, some of our consumable products carry higher costs than\nother goods, so our gross profit margin will be negatively impacted as the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products increases. Imported merchandise and\nprivate label goods generally carry lower costs than domestic goods. Our product mix is affected by the supply of goods, including imported goods, and could be negatively\nimpacted by various factors, including those described under “Higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and\nprofitability” on page 11.\nIn our Family Dollar segment, our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such\nmerchandise at profitable and appropriate prices. A sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at Family Dollar could suffer.\nWe are continuing to refine our pricing strategy at Family Dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability.\nOur inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at Family Dollar could have a negative effect on our business.\nIn addition, our Family Dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items, and the number of such items has been increasing. We believe our success in\nmaintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including our pricing, costs, quality, customer perception and timely development and\nintroduction of new products. We may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and, as a result, our business and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Additionally, the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our non-private brand suppliers.\nOur business is seasonal, and adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our full-year financial results.\nOur highest sales periods are during the Christmas and Easter seasons, and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income\nduring the fourth quarter. In anticipation, we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores and help ship product from our distribution centers.\nLead times for seasonal product purchases are longer and could result in inventory markdowns if sales do not meet expectations. A reduction in sales during these periods could\nadversely affect our operating results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year. Untimely merchandise\ndelays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect. When Easter is observed earlier in the year, the selling season is shorter and, as a result, our sales\ncould be adversely affected. Easter was observed on April 9, 2023, and will be observed on March 31, 2024.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFailure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results.\nRisk of loss or theft of assets, including inventory shrinkage, is inherent in the retail business and has recently reached historically high rates. Loss may be caused by error\nor misconduct of associates, customers, vendors or other third parties including through organized retail crime and professional theft, and may be further impacted by\nmacroeconomic factors, including the enforcement environment, or may be the result of damage or destruction of our inventory by natural disasters. We have experienced\ncharges in the past, and our inability to cost-effectively prevent and/or minimize the loss or theft of assets, or to accurately predict and accrue for the impact of those losses,\ncould adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have risks related to the security of our facilities including risks of personal injury to customers or associates.\nWe operate stores and other facilities in locations subject to a risk for crimes of break-ins, theft, property damage, and interpersonal violence, which may include an active\nshooter or mass casualty/damage event. While we have instituted programs aimed at reducing these risks, particularly of workplace violence, no security or safety program is\n100% effective, and there is a risk that they will not prevent the occurrences of such crimes or related harms. Any such incidents of violence could have a negative effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, associate relations or customer reputation.\nWe face significant pressure from competitors which may reduce our sales and profits.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive with respect to price, customers, store locations, merchandise quality, product assortment, service offerings, product sourcing,\nlabor, and market share. The marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising\nstrategies, including mobile and online shopping. To remain competitive, we may be required to change our product offering or lower our prices, but our ability to do so may be\nlimited with the result that we could see lower sales or reduced profitability.\nWe expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. Some of our current or potential competitors\nhave greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. The substantial growth in e-commerce has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors,\nnew business models, and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. We cannot guarantee that\nwe will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, and we believe that doing so may require substantial capital expenditures, for\nexample in technology. Our ability to effectively compete will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and execute on our strategic initiatives. Please see “Item 1.\nBusiness” for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage our organizational talent and capacity, including attracting and retaining qualified associates and key\npersonnel.\nOur growth and performance are dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel for both Dollar Tree and Family\nDollar. At our stores and distribution centers, we must recruit, develop, train, and retain qualified and diverse associates in relatively large numbers, while also working to\ndecrease turnover in these positions. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of\nqualified personnel, unemployment levels, wage rates and salary levels (including the heightened possibility of increased federal, state and/or local minimum wage rates/salary\nlevels), health and other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations (including those relating to employee benefit programs such as\nhealth insurance and paid leave programs), labor activism, associate safety issues, associate expectations and productivity, and our reputation and relevance within the labor\nmarket. If we are unable to attract, develop and retain adequate numbers of qualified associates, our operations, customer service levels, legal and regulatory compliance, and\nsupport functions could suffer. In addition, to the extent a significant portion of our associate base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor and other related costs could\nincrease. The potential financial impact of union organization is further compounded by the possibility of federal agencies adopting or imposing changes to existing labor law\nthat could facilitate union organizing. We currently do not have any employees represented by unions. Our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is\nconstrained by our pricing model, and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business.\nSuccessful execution of our plans and strategies also depends on the efforts of key management personnel. The labor market for these executives and other key personnel is\nnationwide in scope and intensely competitive. The loss of such personnel, or the inability to hire, train, motivate and retain them, or to manage changes to our organizational\nstructure and capacity, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial condition. In addition, failure to develop an adequate\nsuccession plan for senior positions could reduce our organizational capabilities and competitive advantage during a transition. Turnover in such positions can disrupt progress\nin implementing business strategies, result in a loss of institutional knowledge, cause greater workload demands for remaining team members and divert attention away from\nkey areas of the business, or otherwise negatively impact the company’s growth prospects or future operating results.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, landlords, contractors, and external\nbusiness partners. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations\nand cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships\nbetween the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing\nthese relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal,\nreputational and operational risk.\nIn fiscal 2023, we purchased and delivered approximately 15% of our merchandise for our Family Dollar segment, and to a lesser extent for our Dollar Tree segment,\nthrough our relationship with McLane Company, Inc., which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers. We also rely on third parties to deliver frozen\nand refrigerated product, as well as chocolate in the summer, to our Dollar Tree stores.\nRisks Relating to Strategic Initiatives\nWe may not be successful in implementing or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives, and our plans for implementing such initiatives may be altered or\ndelayed due to various factors, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners to drive productive sales growth and improve operating\nefficiency, including, among others:\n• We continue to expand our Dollar Tree brand assortment at the $1.25 price point and expand our multi-price product assortment.\n• Our initiatives at Family Dollar provide tailored store formats and significantly improved merchandise offerings.\n• Our comprehensive store portfolio optimization review to improve profitability by identifying candidates for closure or re-bannering.\n• Across both banners, we have initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced training, and other projects to support our workforce as well as initiatives to\noptimize and modernize our stores.\n• Our supply chain initiatives include optimizing our transportation network and distribution methods.\n• We continue our significant investments in our technology across our business, including our store network and point-of-sale, merchandising and supply chain.\nThe implementation, timing and results of these complex strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may require that we make significant\nestimates and assumptions in our planning. These initiatives place significant demands on our accounting, financial, information technology, and other systems, and on our\nbusiness overall. We are dependent on our management’s ability to oversee these initiatives effectively and implement them successfully. If our estimates and assumptions\nabout our initiatives are incorrect, or if we miscalculate the resources or time, we need to complete them or fail to execute on them effectively, our pursuit of these initiatives\nmay increase our costs and reduce our margins and profitability.\nTo be effective, our strategies have and will continue to require significant investment in cross-functional operations and management focus, along with supporting\ninvestments. If we are unable to attract and retain employees or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our efforts, implement improvements\nto systems in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if initiatives related to our multi-priced merchandise\nat Dollar Tree, new store concepts and merchandise offerings at Family Dollar, and improved customer experience do not appeal to our customers or if we are unable to\nconsistently meet our brand execution promises in a cost-effective manner, we may experience a loss of customer confidence or lost sales, which could adversely affect our\nreputation and results of operations.\nA failure to properly execute our plans and business strategies, delays in executing our plans and business strategies, increased costs associated with executing on our plans\nand business strategies, or failure to identify alternative strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe have incurred losses due to impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated\nannually for impairment. An evaluation is also performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 the company initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, and its recently announced decisions to close\napproximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores and approximately 30 underperforming Dollar Tree stores has led to additional impairments of related assets. The\nFamily Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the Family\nDollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. Please refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nShould we experience business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends, we could recognize additional impairments to our goodwill,\nintangible assets and other long-lived assets. We monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our impairment analysis, and if business or other market conditions\ndevelop that are materially different than we currently anticipate, we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation. Any reduction in or impairment of assets will result in a\ncharge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we\nrecorded a $1,069.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a $950.0 million non-cash trade name impairment charge, and a $503.9 million non-cash store asset\nimpairment charge. For additional information on recent impairments, please refer to Note 15 and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nWe rely on computer and technology systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems, including because of\na cyberattack, could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and, in certain cases, those of third-party service providers to support nearly all key functions in our business,\nincluding managing inventory, operating our stores, processing credit card and customer transactions and summarizing results. Our ability to effectively manage our business\nand coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the capabilities, confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability\nto successfully acquire and integrate upgraded or replacement systems as needed to support our business requirements and strategic initiatives. We also rely on third-party\nproviders and platforms for many of these computer and technology systems and support.\nAlthough we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available\nto us. This may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors, including through malicious software, ransomware and other\ncyberattacks, which may originate from state actors and may increase during times of international tensions. Failures may also be caused by various other factors, including\npower outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, obsolescence or failure of vendor support, flaws in\nthird-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers.\nTo support the growth of our business, we are making substantial investments in our information technology systems. Transitioning to these new or upgraded processes and\nsystems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. Implementation is also highly dependent on the coordination of numerous associates, contractors and\nsoftware and system providers. While these efforts have resulted in improvements to our operational systems, we expect to continue to incur expenses to implement additional\nimprovements and upgrades to our systems. Many of these expenditures have been and may continue to be incurred in advance of the realization of any direct benefits to our\nbusiness. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful at improving our operational systems, or that our efforts will result in the anticipated benefits to us. We may also\nexperience difficulties in implementing or operating our new or upgraded operational or IT systems, including, but not limited to, ineffective or inefficient operations,\nsignificant system failures, system outages, delayed implementation and loss of system availability, which could lead to increased implementation and/or operational costs, loss\nor corruption of data, delayed shipments, excess inventory and interruptions of operations resulting in lost sales and/or profits. If our information technology systems, upgrades\nand associated change management are not adequate to support our business and our strategic initiatives, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and our business may become less competitive.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe potential unauthorized access to our systems could disrupt operations or lead to the theft of data which may violate privacy laws and could damage our business\nreputation, subject us to negative publicity, litigation and costs, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nMany of our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems, and for\nadministrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, contain personal, financial or other confidential\ninformation that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers.\nWe are exposed to persistent and substantial risks from cybersecurity threats, as the number of cyberattacks targeting retailers and corporate networks grows, and the\nvolume, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions and threats from around the world increase daily. Both we and our vendors have experienced data security\nincidents; however, to date, these incidents have not been material to our results of operations. The security measures that we and/or our third-party partners put in place cannot\nprovide absolute security to prevent harm to our systems or safeguard our customers’ personal information (including debit and credit card information), our associates’ private\ndata, suppliers’ data, and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information.\nCybercriminals, who may include well-funded state actors or organized criminal groups, are rapidly evolving their cyberattack techniques and tactics, which are becoming\nincreasingly more sophisticated and challenging to detect. We and/or our third-party suppliers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate, detect, and appropriately respond\nto cybersecurity attacks, including data security breaches and data loss.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the\ncollection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data of customers, associates, or others. These laws permit regulators to assess potentially\nsignificant fines for data privacy violations and may create a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations. Our efforts to comply with consumer\nprivacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial\npenalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.\nLikewise, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the Payment\nCard Industry Security Standards Council. As a Level 1 Merchant, we are subject to assessment and attestation for PCI-DSS compliance on an annual basis. A failure to meet\nand maintain compliance with PCI-DSS requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment, which would materially impact our\nability to sell our products. In addition, our credibility and reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected, which could result in our\ncustomers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. Non-compliance with PCI-DSS requirements also may subject us\nto recurring and accumulating fines until compliance is achieved. Considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be\ndeemed to be non-compliant. We are currently in compliance with the PCI-DSS standards.\nMoreover, significant additional capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to continue to strengthen our overall cybersecurity posture and prevent\nfuture security breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and services (e.g., credit-monitoring services) for those whose data\nhas been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully\nlimit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nThe unavailability of information technology systems on which we rely or the failure of those systems or software to perform as required to support our business needs for\nany reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such events, could disrupt our business, decrease performance, and increase overhead costs. If we, our vendors, or\nother third parties with whom we do business experience significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents, we could be\nsubject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to\nprotect their information, stop using our loyalty programs, or stop shopping with us altogether. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nLegal, Regulatory and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Risks\nLegal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation and other proceedings involving associates, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others\nthrough private actions, class actions, derivative actions, governmental investigations, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, arbitrations or other similar actions.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, our operations and/or the products we sell are subject to regulatory oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, states’ attorneys-general, and other federal, state, local and applicable foreign governmental authorities. Where\nsuch authorities believe that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, they may require prompt corrective action, and/or proceed directly to other\nforms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations in one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain\nviolations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products, assessing civil or criminal sanctions or penalties, and requiring enhancements to our compliance\nprograms or reporting requirements. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively selling our products and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nFor example, we recently resolved a previously disclosed investigation by the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) regarding a historical rodent issue at Family\nDollar’s West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center (“DC 202”) and the related adulteration of products regulated by the FDA. Under this resolution, a Family Dollar\nsubsidiary pled guilty to a one count misdemeanor violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331(k), 333(a)(1) for causing FDA-regulated products to become\nadulterated and paid $200,000 in fines and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $41,475,000 to the United States. For a discussion of other impacts of this resolution,\nsee also “Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise\nadversely affect us” below.\nOur products could also cause illness or injury, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. Product liability, personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us\nrelating to product adulteration, product tampering, mislabeling, recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell, or with respect to our handling or storage\nof such products. Recent such matters have led to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees\nand other expenses. A significant product liability, consumer fraud, or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory compliance or enforcement action or a product recall\ncould materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is\nunsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our reputation. We\nseek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our vendors, where appropriate, or insurance coverage, and if we do not have adequate contractual\nindemnification or insurance available, such claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Our ability to obtain the benefit of\ncontractual indemnification from vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors, for example because the\nvendors are overseas or lack financial resources. Our litigation-related expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our financial\ncondition and/or results of operations even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nThe outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate\namounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these matters, if decided adversely to us or settled\nby us, may result in an expense that may be material to our consolidated financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business\noperations are required. If we experienced a material loss arising from these matters, we could also become subject to shareholder derivative suits and securities litigation. The\ncost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings, including arbitrations, may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation, including\nlitigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements, which could negatively affect customer perception of our business,\nregardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nFor a discussion of current legal matters, please see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Contingencies.”\nOur failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely\naffect us.\nWe operate in an increasingly regulated environment across a large and diverse geographic footprint, and we devote substantial resources to ensure effective compliance\nwith numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations. The complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs continue to increase due to additional\nlegal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operations, and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts. New or revised laws, regulations, orders, policies and\nrelated interpretations and enforcement practices, including product and food safety, marketing, labeling or pricing; information security and privacy; artificial intelligence;\nlabor and employment; employee wages and benefits; health and workplace safety (including Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules); imports and customs;\ntaxes; bribery; climate change; and environmental compliance, may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially\nincrease our cost of doing business.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf our programs do not adequately anticipate regulatory expectations or requirements, or if we fail to appropriately design and maintain an effective enterprise compliance\nprogram and system of controls to prevent and detect non-compliance, including implementing and communicating a strong culture of compliance, there is a possibility any\nfailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would subject us to enhanced legal risks and adverse outcomes. Violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely\nor incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties (including loss of licenses, eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as SNAP\nor significant fines), class action or other litigation, governmental investigation or action and reputational damage. As part of our recent resolution of the DOJ investigation\nregarding DC 202, we agreed to implement improved internal controls, compliance codes, policies, and procedures, many of which were already underway or completed, and to\nmake periodic reports to the DOJ for three years. The failure to properly manage our overall compliance program and fully comply with our obligations could adversely affect\nour ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation, and negatively impact our financial position and results of\noperations.\nNew laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, various municipalities have begun regulating the placement or proximity of our\nstores or may place requirements on labor relations or the types of products we sell. In addition, the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with\nclimate change and the proposed transition to a low carbon economy, including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate or tax greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly\nincrease our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products. These laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to, requirements relating to\nhazardous waste materials, recycling, single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility, use of refrigerants, carbon pricing or carbon taxes, product energy efficiency\nstandards and product labeling.\nIn addition, significant changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage increases, health care, labor relations laws or\nworkplace safety, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. An increase in federal corporate tax rates also could adversely affect our profitability.\nChanges in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, product and food safety, energy or environmental protection, and tariff and other\ntrade restrictions, among others, could cause our expenses to increase or result in product recalls.\nOur business is subject to evolving disclosure requirements and expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters that could expose us to\nnumerous risks.\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to social responsibility, climate change and other ESG practices. We risk damage to our brand and reputation,\nincluding risk to our plans for profitable growth, if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as worker safety and welfare, diversity and inclusion, environmental\nstewardship, support for local communities, and corporate governance and transparency. Adverse incidents could impact the value of our brand, the cost of our operations and\nrelationships with associates, customers or investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results.\nIn addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, associates, and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters and related disclosures. These changing rules,\nregulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time\nand attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting,\nmeasuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s\nproposed climate-related reporting requirements. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and\nsocial investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and\nexpensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the\naccuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on\nstandards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to mature, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. If we\nare unable to meet our ESG-related goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, if our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or\ninaccurate, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or\npurchase products from a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness and Our Common Stock\nOur inability to access credit or capital markets, a downgrade of our credit ratings and/or increases in interest rates could negatively affect our financing costs, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe rely on internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program to fund our seasonal working capital requirements for\nexisting and new stores, distribution network programs and other capital projects. In addition, we have $3.45 billion of senior notes outstanding as of February 3, 2024.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and our credit ratings. Changes in the credit\nand capital markets, including as a result of financial market disruptions, rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions, could increase the cost of\nfinancing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Further, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly,\nour cost of financing. Our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. A\ndowngrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to credit and capital markets, limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us, result in more restrictive\nfinancial and other covenants in our debt agreements and would likely significantly increase our overall financing costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to access financial markets when needed, on favorable terms or at all, whether to refinance our existing indebtedness on or before maturity or to fund our\ncapital expenditures or working capital needs not satisfied by cash flows from operations, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nIn addition, we have exposure to future interest rates based on variable rates under our revolving credit facility and issuances under our commercial paper program and to\nthe extent we raise additional debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations or otherwise. Significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could\nmaterially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results.\nOur business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and\nmanagement team are committed to acting in the best interests of all our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in\nseeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful. Shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to\neffect change in the future, through various strategies that could include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, and litigation. Responding to these actions\nmay be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management, and associates, and impact our relationship with\ninvestors, vendors, and other third parties. Shareholder engagement also may result in changes to our business plans, operations, strategies, initiatives, governance,\nmanagement, and risk factors. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from these actions of shareholders could also affect the market price and volatility\nof our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond our control, include the\nperceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business; changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts, investors or us; trading activity by our large\nshareholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations; actions or\nannouncements by us or our competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions or changes; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In\naddition, the stock market in general has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our\ncommon stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.\nCertain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his/her best interest.\nThese provisions, among other things, provide that only the Board of Directors, the chairman or vice chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer or shareholders who\nown 15% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders; establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of\ncandidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings; and permit the Board of Directors, without further action of the\nshareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock. However, we believe that these provisions allow our\nBoard of Directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n21\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe understand the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. Our business operations leverage\ninformation technology infrastructure and third-party vendors and systems which makes us susceptible to various cyber threats. We have implemented a comprehensive\ncybersecurity risk management program to mitigate these risks and safeguard our assets.\nWe have measures in place to prevent, detect, and manage material risks from unauthorized access to our electronic information systems. These include various controls,\ntechnologies, and processes that protect confidential, proprietary, business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business\noperation.\nWe also consider cybersecurity, along with other business risks, within our enterprise risk management framework. Our assessment, identification and management of\ncybersecurity and data privacy risks are reported as part of our regular enterprise risk assessments, security audits and risk management programs. In addition, we leverage\nrecognized consulting firms to conduct application security and penetration testing assessments annually. We also require employees with access to information systems,\nincluding all corporate employees, to undertake cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\nOur cybersecurity program utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework along with risk-based analysis and judgment, to choose the most\neffective security controls to address potential risks. We consider various factors such as likelihood and severity of risk, impact on our organization and others if a risk\nmaterializes, feasibility and cost of controls, and the effects of controls on our operations and others.\nBecause we rely on third-party providers and platforms for many of our computer and technology systems and support, we use a variety of processes and tools to address\ncybersecurity threats related to the use of third-party technology and services, including pre-acquisition diligence, imposition of contractual obligations, and performance\nmonitoring. As a part of our monitoring, we regularly obtain System Organization and Control Reports (SOC Reports) for key third-party financial systems.\nAs part of our overall strategic initiatives, we have made significant investments in internal and external resources to support and enhance our technology infrastructure over\nthe next several years. As part of this technology transformation, we plan to continue growing our information security team, enhance our cyber response plan and data privacy\npolicies and evolve our procedures around third-party risk management.\nNo material cybersecurity incidents occurred in fiscal 2023, but future incidents cannot be predicted. Additionally, in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading\n“Cybersecurity and Technology Risks,” forward-looking cybersecurity threats that could have a material impact on our business are discussed. Those sections of Item 1A\nshould be read in conjunction with this Item 1C.\nAlthough we have operational safeguards in place, we still face significant risks from cybersecurity threats, as the number of cyberattacks targeting retailers and corporate\nnetworks grows, and the volume, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions, and threats from around the world increase daily. We (and third parties upon\nwhom we rely) may be unable to implement security controls fully, continuously, and effectively as intended. As described above, we utilize a risk-based approach that focuses\non proactively preventing security risks followed by prompt detection and containment of risks identified. Security controls, no matter how well designed or implemented, may\nonly mitigate, and not fully eliminate risks. In addition, events, when detected by security tools or third parties, may not always be immediately understood or acted upon. If our\ntechnology systems, networks, or information are compromised by malicious software, ransomware, or other cyberattacks, we could lose critical data or confidential\ninformation of our customers, vendors or associates, experience disruptions in our ability to distribute and sell merchandise and manage inventories, incur substantial\nremediation costs and/or become subject to negative publicity, costly government actions or litigation.\nNotwithstanding the deliberate approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material\nadverse effect on us. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.\nGovernance\nOur Audit Committee, which includes a member with cybersecurity experience, oversees our management of risks relating to information security and data privacy. At\nleast semiannually, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing our risk exposures related to information security and data privacy with management.\nThese management updates are designed to inform the Audit Committee of any potential risks relating to information security or data privacy and any relevant mitigation or\nremediation tactics being implemented. In addition, as part of our regular enterprise risk management assessments, cybersecurity risks are reported to and assessed by the\nEnterprise Risk Committee, comprised of senior leadership from key business functions.\n22\nTable of Contents\nTo more effectively prevent, detect and respond to information security threats, we have a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is\nresponsible for our overall information security, cyber risk, and business continuity. The CISO brings over 25 years of extensive experience in information technology and\ninformation security and serves as the designated executive leader for cyber or data-related incident response activities. Our CISO’s experience includes leading cybersecurity\nprograms for Fortune 100 companies.\nIn addition to the CISO, the Chief Information Officer and Chief Legal Officer are responsible for overseeing risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy. Our Chief\nInformation Officer’s experience includes more than 25 years of leading all information technology strategies and operations and oversight of IT systems for various Fortune\n100 companies, and our Legal Department has personnel specializing in data privacy and cybersecurity who assist our team in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.\nWe have a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan that is integrated into our crisis management program. The plan provides protocols for evaluating and responding to\ncybersecurity incidents, including incident disclosure and reporting, notification to senior management and relevant committees, and meeting external reporting obligations. The\nplan is reviewed and updated regularly by our CISO and Chief Legal Officer to ensure its continued effectiveness. We recently performed tabletop exercises where we\nperformed walkthroughs of cyber incident situations to test our response plan. We plan to continue testing on a periodic basis going forward.\nItem 2. Properties\nAs of February 3, 2024, we operated 16,526 stores across the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia and operated 248 stores within five Canadian\nprovinces.\nThe Dollar Tree segment includes 8,415 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands with stores predominantly ranging from 8,000 - 10,000\nselling square feet. The Family Dollar segment includes 8,359 stores operating under the Family Dollar brand with stores predominantly ranging from 6,000 - 8,000 selling\nsquare feet. For additional information on store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, see “Item 7. Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Overview.”\nWe lease the vast majority of our stores and expect to lease the majority of our new stores as we expand. Our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term, generally\nbetween five and ten years, with options to extend; in some cases we have initial lease terms of up to fifteen years. We believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to\npursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions. As current leases expire, we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals, if desired,\nfor present store locations, or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area.\nOur network of distribution centers is strategically located throughout the United States to support our stores. As of February 3, 2024, we operated 25 distribution centers in\nthe United States occupying a total of 23.2 million square feet, 15 of which are primarily dedicated to serving our Dollar Tree stores and ten of which serve our Family Dollar\nstores. Except for 0.4 million square feet of our distribution center in San Bernardino, California and short-term leases for offsite facilities, all of our distribution center capacity\nis owned.\nEach of our distribution centers use advanced material handling equipment, warehouse management systems, and radio frequency to track our inventory and ensure\nefficient operations. With the exception of three of our facilities, each of our distribution centers in the United States also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems.\nSignificant investments are underway to improve climate control conditions in our distribution centers.\nDistribution services in Canada are provided by a third party from facilities in British Columbia and Ontario.\nOur store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia is located in an approximately 0.5 million square foot office tower that we own.\nFor more information on financing of our new, expanded and renovated stores, and distribution centers, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Funding Requirements.”\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we have been involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims\nrelated to our business. For information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, please see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption\n“Contingencies.” For a further description of certain of these matters and their impact, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”: “Legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition” on page 18 and “Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could\nincrease our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us” on page 19.\n23\nTable of Contents\nItem 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market® under the symbol “DLTR.” As of March 18, 2024, we had 2,045 shareholders of record.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Under the existing Board repurchase\nauthorization, we may repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions with financial institutions. The repurchase\nauthorization does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased 3,905,599, 4,613,696 and 9,156,898 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of $504.3 million, $647.5 million and $950.0 million in fiscal\n2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The fiscal 2023 share repurchases occurred prior to the fourth quarter and the cost incurred includes the applicable excise tax. As\nof February 3, 2024, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our existing $2.5 billion Board repurchase authorization.\nStockholder Matters\nWe anticipate that substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future will be retained for the development and expansion of our business, the\nrepayment of indebtedness and, as authorized by our Board of Directors, the repurchase of stock. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in fiscal\n2024.\n25\nTable of Contents\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph sets forth the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock during the five fiscal years ended February 3,\n2024, compared with the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Distribution & Retail Index.

As you read Management’s Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes, included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a leading operator of more than 16,700 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations through two reporting segments. Our Dollar Tree segment is the\nleading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of $1.25, with additional offerings at $3, $4 and $5 price points. Our\nFamily Dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient\nneighborhood stores.\nOur net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores. Second is the\nperformance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation and changes in the product\nassortment, pricing, or quality. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only\nthose stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded, relocated\nor remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. Stores that have been re-\nbannered (i.e., Family Dollar stores converted to Dollar Tree stores, or vice versa) are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable\nstore net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand. Sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable store net sales are referred\nto as non-comparable store sales and consist of sales from new stores open fifteen months or less and stores that are closed permanently or expected to be closed for more than\n90 days.\nAnnual Results\nFinancial highlights for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, include:\n• Net sales increased 8.0% to $30,581.6 million, due to a 4.6% enterprise-wide comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $1,184.5 million at non-comparable\nstores. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $559.3 million of the total net sales increase.\n• Gross profit increased 4.3% to $9,309.6 million as a result of our net store growth and the 53rd week. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 110 basis\npoints to 30.4%, primarily due to higher shrink, distribution and markdown costs, partially offset by lower freight costs and occupancy costs. Excluding $86.2 million of\ndistribution and markdown costs related to the store portfolio optimization review, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 80 basis points.\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3,514.5 million or 52.5%, primarily due to a $1,069.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a $950.0\nmillion non-cash trade name impairment charge, a $503.9 million non-cash store asset impairment charge, and $56.7 million in DC 202-related litigation charges.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 980 basis points to 33.4%. Excluding the impairment and litigation charges\nnoted above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 125 basis points primarily due to higher store-based payroll\nexpenses, unfavorable development of general liability claims, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses.\n• Operating income (loss) was ($881.8) million and as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 1,080 basis points to (2.9)% primarily due to the current year impairments\nand litigation charges noted above. Excluding the impairments and litigation charges, the operating income (loss), as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 210 basis\npoints.\n• The effective tax rate decreased to (1.0)% compared to 23.5% in the prior year primarily due to the current year goodwill impairment charge which is not tax deductible.\n• Net income (loss) was ($998.4) million, or ($4.55) per diluted share, compared to $1,615.4 million, or $7.21 per diluted share.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAt February 3, 2024, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. The average size of stores opened in fiscal\n2023 was approximately 9,300 selling square feet for the Dollar Tree segment and 9,360 selling square feet for the Family Dollar segment. A breakdown of store counts and\nsquare footage by segment for the years ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 is as follows:\nYear Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nDollar Tree Family Dollar Total Dollar Tree Family Dollar Total\nStore Count:\nBeginning 8,134 8,206 16,340 8,061 8,016 16,077\nNew stores 333 308 641 131 333 464\nRe-bannered stores 15 (15) — (5) 9 4\nClosings (67) (140) (207) (53) (152) (205)\nEnding 8,415 8,359 16,774 8,134 8,206 16,340\nRelocations 31 89 120 28 92 120\nSelling Square Feet (in millions):\nBeginning 70.5 61.6 132.1 69.7 59.2 128.9\nNew stores 3.1 2.9 6.0 1.1 3.1 4.2\nRe-bannered stores 0.1 (0.1) — — 0.1 0.1\nClosings (0.6) (1.0) (1.6) (0.4) (1.1) (1.5)\nRelocations — 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.4\nEnding 73.1 63.7 136.8 70.5 61.6 132.1\nStores are included as re-banners when they close or open, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization\nreview, including identifying stores as candidates for closure, re-bannering, or relocation. See the “Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments” section below and Note 16 to\nour consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nFiscal 2023 ended on February 3, 2024 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 added approximately $559.3 million in\nsales. Fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 which ended on January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, each included 52 weeks.\nThe percentage change in comparable store net sales for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows, based on a 53-week\ncomparison for both years:\nYear Ended February 3, 2024\nSales Growth Change in Customer Traffic Change in Average Ticket\nConsolidated 4.6 % 5.4 % (0.8) %\nDollar Tree Segment 5.8 % 7.4 % (1.5) %\nFamily Dollar Segment 3.2 % 2.5 % 0.7 %\nComparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded, relocated and remodeled stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when\nwe open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.\nNet sales per selling square foot is calculated based on total net sales for the preceding 12 months as of the end of the reporting period divided by the average selling square\nfootage during the period. Selling square footage excludes the storage, receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately 20% of the total square footage of our\nstores. We believe that net sales per selling square foot more accurately depicts the productivity and operating performance of our stores as it reflects the portion of our footprint\nthat is dedicated to selling merchandise. Net sales per selling square foot for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023 and January 29,\n2022 is as follows:\n28\nTable of Contents\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nDollar Family Dollar Family Dollar Family\nTree Dollar Total Tree Dollar Total Tree Dollar Total\nNet sales per selling\nsquare foot $234 $220 $227 $220 $214 $217 $203 $212 $207\nThe 53rd week in fiscal 2023 contributed $4 to the total net sales per selling square foot. See our “Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments” below for more\ninformation on the initiatives that are driving our comparable store net sales growth and net sales per selling square foot growth.\nStrategic Initiatives and Recent Developments\nWe continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners to drive productive sales growth, improve operating efficiency,\ninvest in technology, and expand our culture of service to our associates. These initiatives include, among others, the following:\nDollar Tree Merchandising. We continue to expand our brand assortment at the $1.25 price point to provide greater value to our customers and increase customer traffic\nand store productivity. We are continuing to expand our multi-price product assortment, which began with the introduction of $3 and $5 Dollar Tree Plus product in select\ndiscretionary categories, expanded into $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a wide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product. We\nare currently taking actions to improve operating efficiencies and prepare for expanded multi-price products within our stores, including raising shelf heights, implementing\nspace productivity, and rightsizing assortments.\nFamily Dollar Merchandising and Store Portfolio Optimization Review. Our store design initiatives at Family Dollar provide significantly improved merchandise offerings\nand establish a minimum number of cooler doors. We tailor space and assortment to local demographics with emerging formats including H2.5, our primary store format with\noptimized layout and expanded frozen and refrigerated doors; larger rural stores where assortments may include Dollar Tree product; and XSB (Extra Small Box), which adds\nelements of H2.5 optimized to our smaller stores, particularly in urban markets. As of February 3, 2024, we have more than 1,890 stores across these three formats.\nAcross all of Family Dollar’s formats we are expanding our SKUs, continuing to add cooler doors, increasing our standard shelf profile, and implementing planogram and\ncategory resets. We continue to introduce new private brands at Family Dollar, convert control brands to private brands and align our “Family” brand message across key\ncategories.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying\nstores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of this\nportfolio optimization review, we plan to close approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of\nfiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. Additionally, we identified approximately 30 underperforming Dollar Tree\nstores for closure and plan to close each store at the end of the store's current lease term.\nIn connection with the store portfolio optimization review, we incurred $503.9 million of non-cash impairment charges which are included in “Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses” within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of $152.2 million of property, plant and equipment impairment charges\nand $351.7 million of operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges. In addition, we recorded $80.6 million of inventory markdowns and $5.6 million of capitalized\ndistribution cost impairment within “Cost of sales” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the stores expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2024.\nWe also incurred $4.3 million in third party consulting fees related to the portfolio optimization review which are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses”\nwithin the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOur Workforce & Our Workplace. Across both of our banners, we are investing in our talent, including initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced\ntraining, and attractive career opportunities to deliver an enhanced associate experience, reduce turnover, and improve our store standards and efficiencies and ultimately the\ncustomer experience. Additional initiatives include projects to optimize and modernize our stores, with a focus on improving store appearance, delivering consistent experiences\nacross all stores, and driving positive sales trends.\nSupply Chain Optimization. Our supply chain initiatives include enhancing our distribution and transportation network, including investments in our trucking fleet,\ntransportation management systems, a new distribution center with enhanced automation to improve efficiency, and a new RotaCart delivery process to streamline the truck\nunloading and store delivery process. Significant investments are also underway to improve climate control conditions in our distribution centers.\n29\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Investment. We continue our multi-year plan for significant investment in our technology across our business, including our store network and point-of-sale,\nmerchandising and supply chain. We believe these improvements can promote operational efficiencies and deliver an elevated customer experience.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations and year-over-year changes are discussed in the following section. Note that gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less\ncost of sales) divided by net sales. The selling, general and administrative expense rate, operating income (loss) margin and net income (loss) margin are calculated by dividing\nthe applicable amount by total revenue. Basis points, as referred to below, are a percentage of net sales for expense categories within gross profit, and are a percentage of total\nrevenue for all other expense categories. A 100 basis point increase equals 1.00% and a 1 basis point increase equals 0.01%.\nThe following table contains results of operations data for the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022:\nYear Ended\n(in millions, except percentages) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nRevenues\nNet sales $ 30,581.6 $ 28,318.2 $ 26,309.8\nOther revenue 22.2 13.5 11.4\nTotal revenue 30,603.8 28,331.7 26,321.2\nExpenses\nCost of sales 21,272.0 19,396.3 18,583.9\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, excluding\nGoodwill impairment 9,144.6 6,699.1 5,925.9\nGoodwill impairment 1,069.0 — —\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 10,213.6 6,699.1 5,925.9\nOperating income (loss) (881.8) 2,236.3 1,811.4\nInterest expense, net 106.8 125.3 178.9\nOther expense, net 0.1 0.4 0.3\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (988.7) 2,110.6 1,632.2\nProvision for income taxes 9.7 495.2 304.3\nNet income (loss) $ (998.4) $ 1,615.4 $ 1,327.9\nGross profit margin 30.4 % 31.5 % 29.4 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense rate 33.4 % 23.6 % 22.5 %\nOperating income (loss) margin (2.9) % 7.9 % 6.9 %\nInterest expense as a percentage of total revenue 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.7 %\nIncome (loss) before income taxes as percentage of\ntotal revenue (3.2) % 7.4 % 6.2 %\nEffective tax rate (1.0) % 23.5 % 18.6 %\nNet income (loss) margin (3.3) % 5.7 % 5.0 %\nNet Sales\nYear Ended Percentage Change\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022\nNet sales $ 30,581.6 $ 28,318.2 $ 26,309.8 8.0 %\nComparable store net sales change 4.6 % 5.9 % 1.1 %\nThe increase in net sales from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was a result of the comparable store net sales increases in the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments, and net sales\nof $1,184.5 million at non-comparable stores. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $559.3 million of the total net sales increase.\n30\nTable of Contents\nEnterprise comparable store net sales increased 4.6% in fiscal 2023, as a result of a 5.4% increase in customer traffic, partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in average ticket.\nThis increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods. Comparable store net sales increased 5.8% in the Dollar Tree segment and increased 3.2% in the Family Dollar\nsegment.\nGross Profit\nYear Ended Percentage Change\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022\nGross profit $ 9,309.6 $ 8,921.9 $ 7,725.9 4.3 %\nGross profit margin 30.4 % 31.5 % 29.4 % (1.1) %\nThe decrease in gross profit margin from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was a result of the net of the following:\n• Shrink costs increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to unfavorable physical inventory results.\n• Distribution costs increased approximately 40 basis points primarily due to a higher amount of costs capitalized during the prior year resulting from increasing\ninventory levels in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments during that period, and higher distribution center payroll costs recognized during the current year\nin the Dollar Tree segment.\n• Merchandise cost, which includes freight, increased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to re-investment in value-product assortments during the current year\nafter transitioning to the $1.25 price point during the prior year at Dollar Tree, and cost increases due to inflation; as well as higher sales of lower margin consumable\nmerchandise, partially offset by lower freight costs.\n• Markdowns increased approximately 15 basis points primarily due to $80.6 million of inventory reserves for the approximately 600 Family Dollar stores that are\nprojected to close in the first half of fiscal 2024 as a result of the store portfolio optimization review. This increase was partially offset by increased markdown\nallowances on the Family Dollar segment and higher clearance markdowns during the prior year on the Dollar Tree segment in connection with the transition to a\nhigher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.\n• Occupancy costs decreased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of\nsales in the current year.\nWe expect continued pressure on gross profit margin due to unfavorable shrink results in the near term.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYear Ended Percentage Change\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses $ 10,213.6 $ 6,699.1 $ 5,925.9 52.5 %\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpense rate 33.4 % 23.6 % 22.5 % 9.8 %\nThe increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a $1,069.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment\ncharge, a $950.0 million non-cash trade name impairment charge, and a $503.9 million non-cash store asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2023 as further discussed in\nNote 15 and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. All of the impairment charges were in the Family Dollar reporting unit with the exception of $10.8 million of\nstore asset impairment charges in the Dollar Tree reporting unit. In addition, there were $56.7 million in DC 202-related litigation charges in the Family Dollar reporting unit\nduring fiscal 2023. Excluding the goodwill, trade name, and store asset impairment charges and the DC 202-related litigation charges noted above, the selling, general and\nadministrative expense rate increased 125 basis points in fiscal 2023 as a result of the following:\n• Payroll expenses increased approximately 70 basis points primarily due to wage investments and minimum wage increases in store payroll, partially offset by leverage\nfrom the comparable store net sales increase.\n31\nTable of Contents\n• Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 40 basis points primarily due to unfavorable development of general liability claims,\nincreases in professional fees, and higher information technology system costs, partially offset by Family Dollars’ prior year long-lived asset impairments. During\nfiscal 2023, general liability claims began to develop and pay out at amounts significantly higher than anticipated. As a result, we increased our actuarially determined\ngeneral liability accruals which led to an approximately 25 basis point increase in our general liability expenses. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates and\nAssumptions” later in this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information on the calculation\nof our Self-Insurance Liabilities.\n• Store facility costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers\nand associates, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.\n• Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 5 basis points primarily due to capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements,\npartially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of sales in the current year.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nYear Ended Percentage Change\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022\nOperating income (loss) $ (881.8) $ 2,236.3 $ 1,811.4 (139.4)%\nOperating income (loss) margin (2.9)% 7.9 % 6.9 % (10.8)%\nOperating income (loss) margin decreased to (2.9)% in fiscal 2023 compared to 7.9% in fiscal 2022, resulting from the decrease in gross profit margin and the increase in\nthe selling, general and administrative expense rate, as described above.

Our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree\nand Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews to analyze performance and\nallocate resources.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment’s net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). The CODM reviews these metrics\nfor each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income (loss), as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the\nCODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation. Corporate, support\nand other consists primarily of store support center costs and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia that are considered shared\nservices and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. The Family Dollar segment operating income\n(loss) includes advertising revenue, which is a component of “Other revenue” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDollar Tree\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of the Dollar Tree segment:\nYear Ended Percentage Change\nFiscal 2023 vs.\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2022\nNet sales $ 16,770.3 $ 15,405.7 $ 13,922.1 8.9 %\nGross profit 6,008.9 5,775.5 4,603.6 4.0 %\nGross profit margin 35.8 % 37.5 % 33.1 % (1.7) %\nOperating income $ 2,278.8 $ 2,536.0 $ 1,607.0 (10.1) %\nOperating income\nmargin 13.6 % 16.5 % 11.5 % (2.9) %\nNet sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased $1,364.6 million, or 8.9%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to an increase in comparable store net sales of 5.8%,\nand net sales of $467.1 million from non-comparable stores. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $307.0 million of the total net sales increase. Customer traffic increased\n7.4% and average ticket decreased 1.5% in fiscal 2023 based on a 53-week comparison for both periods.\nGross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 35.8% in fiscal 2023 from 37.5% in fiscal 2022. The decrease is due to the net of the following:\n• Merchandise cost, which includes freight, increased approximately 85 basis points primarily due to re-investment in value-product assortments during the current year\nafter transitioning to the $1.25 price point during the prior year and cost increases due to inflation; as well as higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise,\npartially offset by lower freight costs.\n• Distribution costs increased approximately 65 basis points primarily due to a higher amount of costs capitalized during the prior year resulting from increasing\ninventory levels during that period, and higher distribution center payroll costs recognized during the current year.\n• Shrink costs increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to unfavorable physical inventory results.\n• Markdowns decreased approximately 5 basis points primarily due to higher clearance markdowns during the prior year in connection with the transition to a higher\nvalue assortment at the $1.25 price point.\n• Occupancy costs decreased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of\nsales in the current year.\nOperating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 13.6% in fiscal 2023 from 16.5% in fiscal 2022 as a result of the gross profit margin decrease noted\nabove and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. The selling, general and administrative expense rate increased to 22.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to\n21.0% in fiscal 2022 as a result of the following:\n• Payroll expenses increased approximately 65 basis points primarily due to wage investments and minimum wage increases in store payroll, partially offset by leverage\nfrom the comparable store net sales increase.\n• Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to unfavorable development of general liability claims.\nDuring fiscal 2023, general liability claims began to develop and pay out at amounts significantly higher than anticipated. As a result, we increased our actuarially\ndetermined general liability accruals which led to an approximately 25 basis point increase in our general liability expenses. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Assumptions” later in this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information on the\ncalculation of our Self-Insurance Liabilities.\n33\nTable of Contents\n• Store facility costs increased approximately 25 basis points primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers\nand associates, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.\n• Depreciation and amortization expense was unchanged as a percentage of total revenue, as capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements were\noffset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of sales in the current year.\nFamily Dollar\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of the Family Dollar segment:\nYear Ended Percentage Change\nFiscal 2023 vs.\n(dollars in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Fiscal 2022\nNet sales $ 13,811.3 $ 12,912.5 $ 12,387.7 7.0 %\nGross profit 3,300.7 3,146.4 3,122.3 4.9 %\nGross profit margin 23.9 % 24.4 % 25.2 % (0.5) %\nOperating income\n(loss) $ (2,663.5) $ 127.5 $ 543.1 (2,189.0) %\nOperating income\n(loss) margin (19.3) % 1.0 % 4.4 % (20.3) %\nNet sales for the Family Dollar segment increased $898.8 million, or 7.0%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to a comparable store net sales increase of 3.2%, and\nnet sales of $717.5 million at non-comparable stores. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $252.3 million of the total net sales increase. Customer traffic increased 2.5%\nand average ticket increased 0.7% in fiscal 2023 based on a 53-week comparison for both periods.\nGross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased to 23.9% in fiscal 2023 compared to 24.4% in fiscal 2022. The decrease is due to the net of the following:\n• Shrink costs increased approximately 60 basis points primarily due to unfavorable physical inventory results.\n• Markdowns increased approximately 35 basis points primarily resulting from $80.6 million of inventory reserves for the approximately 600 Family Dollar stores that\nare projected to close in the first half of fiscal 2024 as a result of the store portfolio optimization review. This increase was partially offset by increased markdown\nallowances.\n• Distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to a higher amount of costs capitalized in the prior year resulting from increasing inventory\nlevels during that period.\n• Occupancy costs decreased approximately 25 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of\nsales in the current year.\n• Merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to lower freight costs, partially offset by cost increases and higher\nsales of lower margin consumable merchandise.\nOperating income (loss) margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased to (19.3)% in fiscal 2023 from 1.0% in fiscal 2022 resulting from the gross profit margin decrease\nnoted above and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. The selling, general and administrative expense rate increased to 43.2% in fiscal 2023 from\n23.4% in fiscal 2022 primarily due to a $1,069.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a $950.0 million non-cash trade name impairment charge, and a $493.1 million\nnon-cash store asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2023 as further discussed in Note 15 and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there were\n$56.7 million in DC 202-related litigation charges in the Family Dollar reporting unit during fiscal 2023. Excluding the goodwill, trade name, and store asset impairment\ncharges and the DC 202-related litigation charges noted above, the selling, general and administrative expense rate increased 120 basis points in fiscal 2023 as a result of the\nfollowing:\n• Payroll expenses increased approximately 75 basis points primarily due to wage investments and minimum wage increases in store payroll.\n• Store facility costs increased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our\ncustomers and associates, partially offset by higher costs in the prior year associated with a product recall related to issues at DC 202.\n34\nTable of Contents\n• Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to unfavorable development of general liability claim,s\npartially offset by prior year long-lived asset impairments. During fiscal 2023, general liability claims began to develop and pay out at amounts significantly higher\nthan anticipated. As a result, we increased our actuarially determined general liability accruals which led to an approximately 20 basis point increase in our general\nliability expenses. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions” later in this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” for more information on the calculation of our Self-Insurance Liabilities.\n• Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 5 basis points primarily due to capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements,\npartially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of sales in the current year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, enhance and grow our distribution network, operate our existing stores, maintain and\nupgrade our technology, and support our other strategic initiatives. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in\nthe months of September and October. We have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing and new stores and have funded our distribution network\nprograms and other capital projects from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program.\nThe following table compares cash flow-related information for the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 2,684.5 $ 1,614.8 $ 1,431.5\nInvesting activities (2,107.6) (1,253.8) (1,019.9)\nFinancing activities (530.0) (686.8) (836.5)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1,069.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to improving inventory levels, partially offset by\nlower current year earnings, net of non-cash items. Inventory decreased $335.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of $1,085.4 million during fiscal 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $853.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 due to higher capital expenditures in the current year.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $156.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower payments for stock repurchases in the current\nyear.\nFor detail on our long-term and short-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of “Funding Requirements” below, as well asN ote 5 and Note 6 to\nour consolidated financial statements.\nShare Repurchases\nWe repurchased 3,905,599, 4,613,696 and 9,156,898 shares of common stock on the open market in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, for\n$504.3 million, $647.5 million and $950.0 million, respectively. At February 3, 2024, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our existing $2.5 billion Board repurchase\nauthorization.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2024 to total approximately $650.0 million to $675.0 million, which includes\ncapital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs. Our total estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, including\nplanned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, store renovations, supply chain and information technology investments, and other property improvements. We believe\nthat we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations, our commercial\npaper program and borrowings under our credit facilities.\nOur material contractual obligations consist of long-term and short-term borrowings and related interest payments and operating lease obligations. Additionally, we have\ncommitments related to ocean shipping contracts, software license and support agreements, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our\nstores. Other commitments include letters of credit for imported merchandise, standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and\nsurety bonds that serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. For additional information regarding these obligations, including\namounts outstanding at February 3, 2024, refer to Note 5, Note 6 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). To\nprepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable,\nbut that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop\nand support a range of alternative estimated amounts. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we\nconsider critical.\nInventory Valuation\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Merchandise Inventories,” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower\nof cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average\nbasis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the\nretail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or\nmarket when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.\nInventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly\naffect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink\nand markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.\nWe estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover\nmerchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside\nof our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for\nmarkdowns compared with actual results.\nOur accrual for shrink is based on the shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.\nThese estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken\nbetween January and October of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 3, 2024 is based on estimated shrink for most of fiscal 2023, including the fourth\nquarter. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and, historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nOur management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying\ninventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.\n36\nTable of Contents\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nThe liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general liability and auto are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions.\nSemiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing these liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. These actuarial valuations are\nestimates based on our claims experience for current and prior periods, exposure and severity factors, historical loss development factors, and other actuarial assumptions and\nthe related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change.\nManagement’s estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the\nnet total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our self-insurance liabilities associated with workers’\ncompensation, general liability and auto are recorded within “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to\n$363.5 million and $318.2 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to general liability claims beginning to develop and\npay out at amounts significantly higher than anticipated, resulting in higher actuarially determined accruals.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. These assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more\nfrequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to,\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada. Goodwill has been assigned to the\nreporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. We have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative\nimpairment test. In connection with the fiscal 2023 annual impairment evaluation, management’s qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the Family Dollar reporting unit was less than its carrying value. There were no indicators that the fair value of the Dollar Tree or Dollar Tree Canada reporting units\nwere less than their carrying value. Therefore, management performed a quantitative assessment of both the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name.\nWe estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. Under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair\nvalue based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and adjusted for a control\npremium. Under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current\nmarket conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows), in arriving at the fair value of the reporting\nunit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThe Family Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the\nFamily Dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may\ndiffer significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. Critical assumptions that are used as part of a quantitative Family Dollar\ngoodwill evaluation include:\n• The potential future revenue, EBITDA and cash flows of the reporting unit.T he projections use management’s assumptions about economic and market conditions\nover the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. The resulting revenue,\nEBITDA and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business\nplan period. These operating plans include anticipated investments in associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased\nsupply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing, and enhancements to our technology infrastructure. We believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our\nfiscal 2023 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair\nvalue.\n• Selection of an appropriate discount rate. Calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a\nweighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical\ncapital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. We engaged third\nparty experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our Family Dollar reporting unit. The weighted-\naverage cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 10.5% for our fiscal 2023 analysis.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOur evaluation of goodwill resulted in an impairment charge of $1,069.0 million in fiscal 2023 related to the Family Dollar reporting unit. Our evaluation of goodwill did\nnot result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2023 goodwill impairment was driven primarily by the Family Dollar reporting unit’s\nbelow plan performance, management’s store portfolio optimization review and the continued refinement of our transformational strategies which impact long-term growth\nrates between the segments.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Family Dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-\nlived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. We estimate the fair\nvalue of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including\nestimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which\nare inherently uncertain. The discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount rate used for the Family Dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently\nhigher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit.\nOur evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name resulted in an impairment charge of $950.0 million in fiscal 2023. Our evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name did not\nresult in impairment charges being recorded during fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2023 trade name impairment was driven primarily by a decrease in the royalty rate\nassumption based on lower future growth rates and operating income margin assumptions for the Family Dollar reporting unit.\nFor additional information related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer toN ote 2 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements under the caption “Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets” and Note 15. For additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key\nassumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere\nwithin this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future,\nwe may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies and our assessment of recently issued accounting standards.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes, diesel fuel cost changes and inflation.\nWe may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose\nother than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to our revolving credit facility and borrowings under our commercial paper program. At February 3, 2024, there were no\nborrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or the commercial paper program.\nInflation Risk\nThe primary inflationary factors impacting our business include changes to the costs of merchandise, transportation (including the cost of diesel fuel), and labor. If these\ninflationary pressures become significant, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases on the Family Dollar banner or through adjustments to\nour product assortment, improvements in operational efficiencies or increases in our comparable store net sales on the Dollar Tree banner. Our inability or failure to do so could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n38\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nEvaluation of estimated self-insurance liability\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company considers actuarial assumptions to estimate its self-insurance liability. As of February 3, 2024,\nthe Company recorded an estimated liability of $363.5 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimated self-insurance liability as a critical audit matter. The estimation process involves auditor judgment and actuarial expertise to\nevaluate the actuarial methods and assumptions that are used to estimate future claim payments. Specifically, the evaluation includes the assumptions related to the loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates which are primarily driven by historical claims paid and incurred data.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal\ncontrols over the Company’s self-insurance liability estimation process. This included controls related to (1) the selection of the actuarial methods, and the development of the\nloss development factors and expected loss rates used to calculate the liability, and (2) the completeness and accuracy of historical claims paid and incurred data. We assessed\nthe Company’s estimate of the liability by testing a selection of certain data, including claims data, utilized by the Company’s actuary by comparing it to relevant\ndocumentation. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n40\nTable of Contents\n• assessing the Company’s actuarial methods by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial methodologies; and\n• evaluating the Company’s actuarial estimates and assumptions related to the loss development factors and expected loss rates, by comparing them to generally accepted\nactuarial methodologies and the Company’s historical data and trends.\nTrade name intangible asset and goodwill impairment\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs trade name intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis\nand when events and changes in circumstances indicate possible impairment of these assets. To estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name intangible asset (Family\nDollar trade name), the Company uses the relief-from-royalty method. To estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit for its impairment testing of goodwill\n(Family Dollar goodwill), the Company uses a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. The impairment charges for the year ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 were $950.0 million for the Family Dollar trade name and $1,069.0 million for the Family Dollar goodwill.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s impairment testing of the Family Dollar trade name and goodwill as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and\nspecialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name, specifically the revenue growth\nrates, discount rate, and company-specific royalty rate, as well as the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit, specifically the revenue growth rates and discount rate.\nMinor changes to these assumptions could have had a significant effect on the fair values determined and the resulting assessment of the carrying value of the Family Dollar\ntrade name and goodwill.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal\ncontrols over the goodwill and intangible asset impairment process, including controls related to the determination and development of the identified assumptions. We assessed\nthe Company’s ability to forecast by comparing the Company’s historical forecasts to actual results. We evaluated the revenue growth rates by comparing them to historical\nresults and performing sensitivity analyses. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n• evaluating the revenue growth rates by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable companies\n• assessing the discount rates by comparing them to a range of discount rates developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies\n• assessing the company-specific royalty rate by comparing it to publicly available market data for comparable licensing agreements.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1987.\nVirginia Beach, Virginia\nMarch

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nUnless otherwise stated, references to “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Dollar Tree, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a\nconsolidated basis.\nWe are a leading operator of discount retail stores in the United States and Canada.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dollar Tree, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and were prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. All amounts stated herein are in U.S. Dollars.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. References to “fiscal 2023” relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3,\n2024. References to “fiscal 2025,” “fiscal 2024,” “fiscal 2022,” and “fiscal 2021” relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended January 31, 2026, February 1, 2025, January 28, 2023,\nand January 29, 2022, respectively.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during\nthe reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 includes $304.2 million and $317.2 million, respectively, of investments primarily in money market\nsecurities which are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 305 “Cash and Cash Equivalents,” we\nconsider all highly-liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due from financial institutions for\nthe settlement of debit card and credit card transactions process within three business days, and therefore are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nMerchandise Inventories\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 330 “Inventory,” merchandise inventories at our distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on a\nweighted-average cost basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation\nof inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.\nCosts directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized as merchandise inventories. Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized into inventory\namounted to $299.8 million and $298.6 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\n47\nTable of Contents\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment,” property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:\nBuildings 39 to 40 years\nBuilding improvements 20 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment, software 3 to 15 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of remaining lease term or related asset life\nDepreciation is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the exception of depreciation\nrelated to our merchandising and distribution-related assets which are included in “Cost of sales” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCapitalized Interest\nWe capitalize interest on borrowed funds during the construction of certain property and equipment based on our weighted average borrowing rates in place while the\nprojects are in progress. We capitalized $5.9 million, $3.8 million and $1.1 million of interest costs in the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022,\nrespectively.\nInsurance Reserves and Restricted Cash\nWe utilize a combination of insurance and self-insurance programs, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain\nrisks, including workers’ compensation, general liability and auto. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by\nconsidering claims experience, exposure and severity factors, historical loss development factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Our self-insurance liabilities associated with\nworkers’ compensation, general liability and auto are recorded within “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and\namounted to $363.5 million and $318.2 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nDollar Tree Insurance, Inc., a South Carolina-based wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of ours, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the\nretained workers’ compensation, general liability and auto exposures. Pursuant to South Carolina insurance regulations, Dollar Tree Insurance, Inc. maintains certain levels of\ncash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures.\nWe also maintain certain cash balances related to our insurance programs which are held in trust and restricted as to withdrawal or use. These amounts are reflected in\n“Restricted cash” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $72.3 million and $68.5 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nLease Accounting\nOur lease portfolio primarily consists of leases for our retail store locations, vehicles and trailers, as well as distribution center space and equipment. In accordance with\nASC Topic 842 “Leases,” we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether\nwe obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months, we\ndetermine the initial classification and measurement of the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. ROU\nassets represent our right to control the underlying assets under lease, over the contractual term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets based on the present value of future minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. Inputs to the\ncalculation of our incremental borrowing rate include the valuations and yields of our outstanding senior notes and their credit spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates,\nadjusted to a collateralized basis by estimating the credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification. Most leases include one or more\noptions to renew and the exercise of renewal options is at our sole discretion. We do not include renewal options in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are\ndeemed to be reasonably certain. Operating lease expense for lease payments not yet paid is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The operating lease ROU\nasset is reduced by lease incentives, which has the effect of lowering the operating lease expense. Operating lease ROU assets are periodically reviewed for impairment losses.\nWe use the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10 “Property, Plant, and Equipment - Overall,” to determine whether an ROU asset is impaired, and if\nso, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe have real estate leases that typically include payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, as well as payments for real estate taxes\nand insurance which are not considered components of the lease. These payments are generally variable and based on actual costs incurred by the lessor. These costs are\nexpensed as incurred as variable lease costs and excluded for the purpose of calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. A smaller number of real estate leases contain fixed\npayments for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the ROU asset and lease\nliability. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments\nadjusted periodically for inflation. These payments are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees\nor material restrictive financial covenants.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review our long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to\nfuture net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any.\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recorded charges of $511.5 million, $39.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, to write down certain assets, including\n$358.7 million, $20.1 million and $3.9 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, to write down operating lease ROU assets. The fiscal 2023 impairment\ncharges include $152.2 million of store asset impairment charges and $351.7 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment charges recorded in connection with the store\nportfolio optimization review as discussed further in Note 16. Fiscal 2022 includes $14.0 million for West Memphis distribution center asset impairments. These charges are\nrecorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets, including the Family Dollar trade name, are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually. In addition,\ngoodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets are tested on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been\nincurred. For both goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets, we have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not\nthat an impairment exists. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment in any given year and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. We\nperform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year. Our reporting units are determined in accordance\nwith the provisions of ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.”\nWhen a quantitative impairment test is performed for the Family Dollar trade name, we compare the fair value, based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty\nmethod, to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nSubsequent to the evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name for impairment, we evaluate the Family Dollar goodwill for impairment. When a quantitative test is\nperformed, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. We recognize goodwill\nimpairment for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million and a non-cash trade name impairment charge of\n$950.0 million, both related to the Family Dollar reporting unit. Refer toN ote 15 for additional information on the results of the trade name and goodwill impairment tests.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" Net sales consist of the net sales of merchandise in our stores.\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of merchandise comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers. Revenue is\nrecognized when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of promised products to our customers, which occurs at a point in time. Sales taxes imposed on\nour revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gift cards that we issue to customers are recorded as\ncontract liabilities until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. We record reductions to revenue for discounts and estimated customer returns. Historically,\nour customer returns have not been material.\n49\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales\nWe include the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution costs, and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.\nVendor Allowances\nWe receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts, cooperative advertising,\nmarkdowns, scandowns and volume rebates. We have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. In accordance with ASC\nSubtopic 705-20 “Accounting for Consideration Received from a Vendor,” we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or defer the payment over the\nperiod the related merchandise is sold. If the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to the\ncost of merchandise.\nPre-Opening Costs\nWe capitalize certain internal labor costs related to new, expanded, renovated, relocated and re-bannered stores after the project becomes probable and only when the costs\nare directly attributable to the preparation of the store-related assets for their intended use. We expense all other pre-opening costs related to our stores and distribution centers,\nas incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs as they are incurred and they are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” within the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. Advertising costs, net of cooperative advertising recoveries from vendors, were $109.6 million, $99.5 million and $93.9 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal\n2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\nfor the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered\nor settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change. Deferred\ntax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. We consider all available\npositive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is\noften dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be\nrealized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. Income taxes\ninclude the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position.\nSettlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change\nto the effective tax rate.\nWe have made the policy election to record any liability associated with Global Intangible Low Tax Income (\"GILTI\") in the period in which it is incurred.\nWe include interest and penalties in the provision for income tax expense and income taxes payable. We do not provide for any penalties associated with tax contingencies\nunless they are considered probable of assessment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all stock-based compensation awards\ngranted to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the service period. In addition, this guidance requires that excess tax benefits\nrelated to stock-based compensation awards be reflected as operating cash flows. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair market value of stock\noption awards and grant date fair value for restricted stock units. We use the \"simplified method\" to estimate the expected life of options, as permitted by accounting guidance.\nThe \"simplified method\" calculates the expected life of a stock option equal to the time from grant to the midpoint between the vesting date and contractual term, taking into\naccount all vesting tranches. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield for the U.S. Treasury bill with a maturity equal to the expected life of the stock option. Expected\nvolatility is based on our historical average. Compensation expense is recognized net of forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the total vesting period, which is the implied\nrequisite service period, or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. Compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the implied\nrequisite service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable. We issue new shares upon exercise of stock options and upon vesting of restricted\nstock units.\n50\nTable of Contents\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $96.7 million, $110.4 million and $79.9 million, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for\nfurther details on stock-based compensation.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 260 “Earnings Per Share,” basic net income (loss) per share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average\nnumber of shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive potential shares and has been\ncomputed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding. Dilutive potential shares include all outstanding\nstock options and unvested restricted stock units after applying the treasury stock method.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currencies of certain of our international subsidiaries are the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. In accordance with ASC\nTopic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters,” foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated\nbalance sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. Capital accounts are translated at historical\nforeign currency exchange rates. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders’ equity in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments that arise from foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions, primarily driven by intercompany transactions,\ndenominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in “Other expense, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. These\nadjustments have not historically been significant.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-04 \"Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs\n(Subtopic 405-50)\" (\"ASU 2022-04\") which requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs used in connection with the purchase of goods and services\nalong with information about their obligations under these programs, including a rollforward of those obligations. We adopted ASU 2022-04 for fiscal 2023 on a retrospective\nbasis, except for the amendments relating to the rollforward requirement, which are required to be adopted for fiscal 2024 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 14 for a discussion of our supply chain finance program.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) which requires\ndisclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to\nthe chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires entities to disclose the title and\nposition of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and allocating resources. Further, it requires\nthat all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 be provided in interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a\nretrospective basis for annual periods beginning in fiscal 2024 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”) which requires entities to\ndisclose specific categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as disaggregated disclosure of income taxes paid, pretax\nincome and income tax expense by jurisdiction. The standard also removes certain disclosure requirements that currently exist under Topic 740. ASU 2023-09 is effective on a\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning in fiscal 2025, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n51\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consists of the following:\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nLand $ 247.9 $ 242.6\nBuildings 1,796.7 1,631.6\nLeasehold improvements 3,646.9 3,227.9\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 5,899.2 5,261.7\nConstruction in progress 1,184.8 633.8\nTotal property, plant and equipment 12,775.5 10,997.6\nLess: accumulated depreciation 6,631.4 6,025.4\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net $ 6,144.1 $ 4,972.2\nDepreciation expense was $819.1 million, $737.4 million, and $672.0 million for the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consist of the following:\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nTaxes (other than income taxes) $ 292.3 $ 253.7\nCompensation and benefits 247.3 143.9\nInsurance 143.4 131.1\nOther 384.2 289.0\nTotal other current liabilities $ 1,067.2 $ 817.7\nNote 4 - Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nCurrent taxes:\nFederal $ 222.2 $ 322.0 $ 271.1\nState 46.1 50.2 56.3\nForeign — 0.1 0.1\nTotal current taxes 268.3 372.3 327.5\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal (225.3) 88.1 50.3\nState (39.2) 30.3 (76.5)\nForeign 5.9 4.5 3.0\nTotal deferred taxes (258.6) 122.9 (23.2)\nProvision for income taxes $ 9.7 $ 495.2 $ 304.3\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“2022 Tax Act”) was enacted into law. A key provision of the 2022 Tax Act is a 15% minimum tax on adjusted\nfinancial statement income. We do not expect any impact to our effective tax rate as a result of the new 15% minimum tax under the 2022 Tax Act.\n52\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate follows:\nYear Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nEffect of:\nGoodwill impairment (22.7) — —\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit (1.0) 3.7 3.7\nNon-deductible expenses (1.0) 0.1 0.1\nWork Opportunity Tax Credit 3.0 (1.4) (1.8)\nDeferred tax rate change — 0.7 (3.8)\nOther, net (0.3) (0.6) (0.6)\nEffective tax rate (1.0)% 23.5 % 18.6 %\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million related to Family Dollar goodwill, as further discussed inN ote 15. The\npurchase of Family Dollar was a stock acquisition, and carryover basis applied for tax purposes. The goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for federal or state tax\npurposes and therefore there is no tax benefit related to the impairment.\nReinvestment of Unremitted Earnings\nSubstantially all of our current year foreign cash earnings in excess of working capital and cash needed for strategic investments are not intended to be indefinitely\nreinvested offshore. Therefore, the tax effects of repatriation for applicable state taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such cash earnings have been provided for in the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have the intent and ability to reinvest substantially all of the non-cash unremitted earnings of our non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state taxes or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the\namounts used for income tax purposes.\n53\nTable of Contents\nSignificant components of our net deferred tax assets (liabilities) follow:\nFebruary 3, January 28,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating lease liabilities $ 1,800.4 $ 1,703.5\nNet operating losses, interest expense and credit carryforwards 72.8 69.3\nAccrued expenses 35.7 31.0\nAccrued compensation expense 39.3 33.9\nState tax election 13.1 14.3\nOther 4.7 2.5\nTotal deferred tax assets 1,966.0 1,854.5\nValuation allowance (17.3) (4.0)\nDeferred tax assets, net 1,948.7 1,850.5\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease ROU assets (1,639.7) (1,630.9)\nOther intangibles (529.1) (760.4)\nProperty and equipment (571.8) (509.2)\nPrepaids (35.8) (25.9)\nInventory (4.4) (14.8)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (2,780.8) (2,941.2)\nDeferred income taxes, net $ (832.1) $ (1,090.7)\nAt February 3, 2024, we had certain state tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $72.8 million. Some of these\ncarryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2043.\nA valuation allowance of $17.3 million, net of federal tax benefits, has been provided principally for certain state credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon\nthe availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we\nbelieve it is more likely than not the remaining existing deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which carrybacks are available or in which we generate\nnet taxable income.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”) for fiscal 2023 and we have been accepted into the program for fiscal 2024. This program\naccelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal tax returns have been examined and all issues have\nbeen settled through the fiscal 2021 tax year. In fiscal 2020, we participated in the CAP under the IRS’s bridge year program and as a result, the IRS will not be completing an\naudit on the fiscal 2020 tax return at this time. Several states completed their examinations during fiscal 2023. In general, fiscal 2020 and forward are within the statute of\nlimitations for state tax purposes. The statute of limitations is still open prior to fiscal 2020 for some states.\nThe balance for unrecognized tax benefits at February 3, 2024 was $22.0 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at February 3, 2024 that, if recognized,\nwould affect the effective tax rate was $17.4 million (net of the federal tax benefit).\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits:\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nBeginning Balance $ 17.4 $ 20.9\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 5.6 2.3\nAdditions, based on tax positions related to current year 2.3 4.0\nSettlements (0.3) (0.1)\nLapses in statutes of limitation (3.0) (9.7)\nEnding balance $ 22.0 $ 17.4\nIt is possible that tax reserves will be reduced for audit settlements and statute expirations within the next 12 months. At this point it is not possible to estimate a range\nassociated with the resolution of these audits. We do not expect any change to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of February 3, 2024, we have recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $2.5 million.\nNote 5 – Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nAt February 3, 2024, we have commitments totaling $190.9 million through fiscal 2025 related to ocean shipping contracts and commitments of $364.2 million through\nfiscal 2034 related to agreements for software licenses and support, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores.\nLetters of Credit\nWe have $425.0 million in trade letters of credit with various financial institutions, under which $133.2 million was committed to these letters of credit issued for routine\npurchases of imported merchandise at February 3, 2024.\nSurety Bonds\nWe have issued various surety bonds that primarily serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. These bonds total 1$59.1\nmillion and are committed through various dates through fiscal 2029.\nContingencies\nWe are defendants in ordinary, routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business, including employment-related matters; infringement of intellectual property\nrights; personal injury/wrongful death claims; real estate matters; environmental and safety issues; and product safety matters. Legal proceedings may also include class,\ncollective, representative and large cases and arbitrations, including those described below. We will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. We do not believe that any of\nthese matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or liquidity. We cannot give assurance, however, that one or\nmore of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the quarter or year in which they are reserved or resolved.\nWe assess our legal proceedings monthly and reserves are established if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Many, if not\nsubstantially all, of our legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and the measurement of any loss can be\ncomplex and subject to judgment. With respect to the matters noted below where we have determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, we are unable to\nreasonably estimate the amount or range of the possible loss at this time due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding legal proceedings.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and\nunanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Management’s assessment of legal proceedings could change\nbecause of future determinations or the discovery of facts which are not presently known. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these proceedings may be substantially\nhigher or lower than currently estimated.\n55\nTable of Contents\nActive Matters\nDC 202-related Matters\nOn February 11, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued Form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at Family Dollar’s West\nMemphis, Arkansas distribution center (“DC 202”) and the related distribution of adulterated product, as well as other processes and procedures that required remediation. In\nconnection therewith, we initiated a retail-level product recall of FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture-regulated products stored and shipped from DC 202 from January 1,\n2021 through February 18, 2022 (the “Recall”), temporarily closed DC 202 for extensive cleaning, temporarily closed the affected stores to permit the removal and destruction\nof inventory subject to the Recall, ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the Recall, ceased the direct shipment of FDA-regulated products from DC 202, and initiated\ncorrective actions. In June 2022, we stopped shipping to stores from DC 202 and have since disposed of all of the subject inventory that was in the facility.\nBeginning in February 2022, 14 putative class actions were filed against us primarily related to issues associated with DC 202 described above. The lawsuits are proceeding\nin federal court in Tennessee using the federal court’s multi-district litigation process, sought class action status, and allege violations of the Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana,\nTennessee, Alabama and Missouri consumer protection laws, breach of warranty, negligence, misrepresentation, deception and unjust enrichment related to the sale of products\nthat were alleged to be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions at DC 202. Plaintiffs sought damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive\ndamages and replacement or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts),\nincluding equitable and injunctive relief. As a result of a mediation held in April 2023, the parties reached a claims made settlement whereby one class member per household\nmay receive a $25 Family Dollar gift certificate. On October 27, 2023, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. Notice of the settlement and how to submit a\nclaim was given beginning November 10, 2023. The period for filing a claim, opting out of the settlement or filing an objection to the settlement ended on January 9, 2024. A\nhearing on final approval of the settlement is scheduled for April 5, 2024.\nOn March 1, 2022, a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to us by the Eastern District of Arkansas requesting the production of information, documents and records\npertaining to pests, sanitation and compliance with law regarding certain of our procedures and products. In connection with this matter, we investigated the condition of FDA-\nregulated product shipped from DC 202 and related matters and cooperated fully with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigation, including producing documents\nand providing additional information. As previously reported by the company on its Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 26, 2024, Family Dollar Stores, LLC (“Family\nDollar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, has entered into a Plea Agreement (the “Plea Agreement”) in connection with the DOJ investigation. Subject to the terms\nand conditions of the Plea Agreement, Family Dollar pled guilty to a one count misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act for causing FDA-regulated\nproducts to become adulterated while such articles were held in DC 202. Under the Plea Agreement, Family Dollar agreed to pay $200,000 in fines and a forfeiture money\njudgment in the amount of $41,475,000, which relates to the value of the adulterated FDA-regulated products that were held in DC 202.\nThe Plea Agreement was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas at a hearing on February 26, 2024, and resolves the federal\ncriminal investigation of Family Dollar. Subject to Family Dollar’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plea Agreement, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of\nArkansas and the DOJ have agreed not to bring further criminal charges against Family Dollar for any acts or conduct arising out of the events covered by the Plea Agreement.\nNo criminal charges were brought against Dollar Tree in connection with this matter. As part of the Plea Agreement, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar agreed to adopt a new or to\nmodify their existing compliance program as it relates to the warehousing and distribution to stores of food, drugs, devices and cosmetics. In addition, the company has agreed\nto make certain reports to the DOJ in connection with its compliance program during the three-year term.\nOn April 28, 2022, the Attorney General for the State of Arkansas filed a complaint in state court alleging violations of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, gross\nnegligence and negligence, strict liability in tort, unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy related to the sale of products that may have been contaminated by virtue of rodent\ninfestation and other unsanitary conditions at DC 202. The State of Arkansas is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, disgorgement, damages, civil penalties, punitive damages\nand suspension or revocation of our authorization to do business in Arkansas. We filed a motion to dismiss the State's claims, and it is too early to determine a likely outcome in\nthe matter.\nAs previously disclosed, we recorded a charge of $30.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with respect to DC 202-related matters which included a proposed\nsettlement of 14 putative consumer class actions and a potential resolution of the DOJ investigation. As a result of Family Dollar entering into the Plea Agreement, we recorded\nan additional charge of $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 bringing the accrual to $56.7 million. At the present time, we are unable to estimate the amount of\nadditional incremental loss, if any, which may result when the remaining matters are finally resolved. However, we do not believe the resolution of the State of Arkansas\ncomplaint or the final settlement of private civil litigation related to DC 202 will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or liquidity.\n56\nTable of Contents\nTalc Product Matters\nMultiple personal injury lawsuits are pending in state court in Illinois, New York, Texas, and New Jersey against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar or both alleging that certain\ntalc products that we sold caused cancer. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages, damages for loss of consortium, and attorneys’ fees and costs.\nAlthough we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss, given the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurances regarding\nthe outcome of pending or future cases. Future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be material, and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance.\nIn addition, although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases, it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to fulfill\ntheir obligations to us.\nAcetaminophen Matters\nSince August 2022, more than 50 personal injury cases have been filed in federal court against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, or both, on behalf of minors alleging that their\nmothers took acetaminophen while pregnant, that the acetaminophen interfered with fetal development such that plaintiffs were born with autism and/or ADHD, and that we\nknew or should have known of the danger, had a duty to warn and failed to include appropriate warnings on the product labels. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and/or\nexemplary damages, restitution and disgorgement, economic damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. These cases, which originated in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia,\nLouisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas, along with other cases against many other defendants, were consolidated into multi-district\ncourt litigation in the Southern District of New York. Recently, the court disqualified all of plaintiffs’ experts and, on that basis dismissed all the cases which had been filed at\nthe time of that decision, including all cases currently filed against us.\nNote 6 - Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nShort-term borrowings and long-term debt at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 consist of the following:\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nShort-Term Borrowings:\nUnsecured commercial paper notes $ — $ —\n$1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility — —\nTotal Short-Term Borrowings $ — $ —\nLong-Term Debt:\n4.00% Senior Notes, due 2025 $ 1,000.0 $ 1,000.0\n4.20% Senior Notes, due 2028 1,250.0 1,250.0\n2.65% Senior Notes, due 2031 800.0 800.0\n3.375% Senior Notes, due 2051 400.0 400.0\nDebt discount and issuance costs (23.7) (28.4)\nTotal Long-Term Debt $ 3,426.3 $ 3,421.6\nLess: Current portion $ — $ —\nNon-current portion of long-term debt $ 3,426.3 $ 3,421.6\nMaturities of long-term debt are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year (in millions)\n2024 $ —\n2025 1,000.0\n2026 —\n2027 —\n2028 1,250.0\nThereafter 1,200.0\nTotal $ 3,450.0\n57\nTable of Contents\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn July 2023, we established a commercial paper program to issue unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities up to3 97 days from the date of issue, up to a\nmaximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. We expect to use the net proceeds of note issuances for general corporate purposes. Our\nRevolving Credit Facility will serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes outstanding under the program. The notes rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured\nand unsubordinated indebtedness. We issued $1,070.5 million principal amount of notes during fiscal 2023 and incurred interest expense of $2.6 million related to these notes.\nAs of February 3, 2024, no notes were outstanding under the program.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn December 8, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and the financial institutions from time to\ntime party thereto, providing for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), of which up to $350.0 million is available for letters of credit. At\nFebruary 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility of $4.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively. The Revolving\nCredit Facility matures on December 8, 2026, subject to extensions permitted under the Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.125%, subject to adjustment based on\n(i) our public debt rating and (ii) our leverage ratio. At February 3, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 6.55%. We pay certain commitment fees in connection\nwith the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility allows voluntary repayment of outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty, other than\ncustomary “breakage” costs with respect to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) loans. There is no required amortization under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, and subject to certain significant baskets and exceptions,\nrestrict our ability to incur subsidiary indebtedness, incur liens, sell all or substantially all of our (including our subsidiaries’) assets and consummate certain fundamental\nchanges. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. The Credit Agreement provides\nfor certain events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be declared due and payable and the\ncommitments thereunder to be terminated.\nIn connection with entry into the Credit Agreement, we terminated all commitments and fulfilled all obligations under our existing credit agreement dated April 19, 2018.\nSenior Notes\nFiscal 2018 Offering\nOn April 19, 2018, we completed the registered offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), $1.0 billion\naggregate principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028\nNotes” and together with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”).\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 2, 2018 (the “Indenture”), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by\nthe First Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 19, 2018 (the “First Supplemental Indenture”).\nThe Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future debt and other obligations that are not, by\ntheir terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.\nThe 2023 Notes were scheduled to mature on May 15, 2023 and bore interest at the rate of3 .70% annually. We redeemed the 2023 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2021 as\ndiscussed in “Repayments of Long-Term Debt” below. The 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025 and bear interest at the rate of 4.00% annually. The 2028 Notes mature on May\n15, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.20% annually. We are required to pay interest on the Notes semiannually, in arrears, on May 15 and November 15 of each year to\nholders of record on the preceding May 1 and November 1, respectively.\nWe may redeem the Notes of each series in whole or in part, at our option, at any time and from time to time prior to March 15, 2025 in the case of the 2025 Notes and\nFebruary 15, 2028 in the case of the 2028 Notes (the date with respect to each such series, the “Applicable Par Call Date”), in each case, at a “make-whole” price described in\nthe First Supplemental Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, we may\nredeem the Notes of the applicable series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof.\n58\nTable of Contents\nIn the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to any series, the holders of the Notes of such series may require us to\npurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,\nto, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture limits our ability and that of our subsidiaries, subject to significant baskets and exceptions, to incur certain secured debt.\nThe First Supplemental Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to\nbecome or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.\nFiscal 2021 Offering\nOn December 1, 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.65% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) and\n$400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Senior Notes due 2051 (the “2051 Notes” and, together with the 2031 Notes, the “New Notes”).\nThe New Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 1, 2021 (the “Second Supplemental\nIndenture”).\nThe New Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future debt and other obligations that are\nnot, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the New Notes.\nThe 2031 Notes mature on December 1, 2031 and bear interest at the rate of2 .650% per annum. The 2051 Notes mature on December 1, 2051 and bear interest at the rate\nof 3.375% per annum. We are required to pay interest on the New Notes semiannually, in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding\nMay 15 and November 15, respectively.\nWe may redeem the New Notes of each series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to (i) in the case of the 2031 Notes, September 1, 2031, and (ii) in\nthe case of the 2051 Notes, June 1, 2051 (the date with respect to each such series, the “Applicable Par Call Date”), in each case, at a “make-whole” price described in the\nSecond Supplemental Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, we may redeem\nthe New Notes of the applicable series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof.\nIn the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) with respect to any series, the holders of the New Notes of such\nseries may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their New Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such New Notes, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture limits our ability and that of our subsidiaries, subject to significant baskets and\nexceptions, to incur certain secured debt. The Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued\ninterest on the New Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.\nRepayments of Long-term Debt\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we used the proceeds from the offering of the New Notes discussed above to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 Notes. We incurred a\nredemption premium of $43.8 million in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes and accelerated the expensing of $2.7 million of amortizable non-cash deferred\nfinancing and original issue discount costs, which are reflected in “Interest expense, net” within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended\nJanuary 29, 2022.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of February 3, 2024, we were in compliance with the debt covenants for both our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.\nNote 7 - Leases\nOur lease portfolio primarily consists of leases for our retail store locations, vehicles and trailers, as well as distribution center space and equipment.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe lease cost for operating leases that was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nOperating lease cost $ 1,713.0 $ 1,652.8 $ 1,602.8\nVariable lease cost 450.3 428.8 417.8\nShort-term lease cost 20.0 10.8 5.6\nTotal lease cost* $ 2,183.3 $ 2,092.4 $ 2,026.2\n*Excludes sublease income, which is immaterial\nThere are no residual value guarantees that exist, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by leases.\nAs of February 3, 2024, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nFiscal Year (in millions)\n2024 $ 1,622.3\n2025 1,572.2\n2026 1,336.3\n2027 1,074.3\n2028 786.4\nThereafter 1,499.5\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 7,891.0\nLess interest 930.4\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 6,960.6\nThe future lease payments above exclude $415.7 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced as of February 3, 2024.\nInformation regarding the weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for operating leases is as follows:\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 5.7 5.7 5.9\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.1 % 3.6 % 3.4 %\nThe following represents supplemental information pertaining to our operating lease arrangements:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,852.1 $ 1,559.7 $ 1,579.8\nNote 8 - Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3\nmeasurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n60\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their\nplacement within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are\nsubject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). We review certain store assets for evidence of impairment. The fair\nvalues are determined based on the income approach, in which we utilize internal cash flow projections over the life of the underlying lease agreements discounted based on our\nrisk-adjusted rate. These measures of fair value, and related inputs, are considered a Level 3 approach under the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 under the caption\n“Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of” and Note 16 for further information regarding the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2023,\nfiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at carrying value, and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. Refer toN ote 2 under the caption\n“Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets” and Note 15 for further information regarding the process of determining the fair value of these assets and the impairment\ncharges recorded in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Restricted cash” and “Accounts payable” as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets\napproximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The carrying values of our Revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under our commercial paper program\napproximate their fair values.\nThe aggregate fair values and carrying values of our long-term borrowings were as follows:\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nCarrying Carrying\n(in millions) Fair Value Value Fair Value Value\nLevel 1\nSenior Notes $ 3,140.0 $ 3,430.1 $ 3,162.8 $ 3,426.7\nThe fair values of our Senior Notes were determined using Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are available.\nNote 9 - Shareholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share. No preferred shares are issued and outstanding at February 3, 2024 and\nJanuary 28, 2023.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nWe periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Under the existing Board repurchase\nauthorization, we may repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions with financial institutions. The repurchase\nauthorization does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased 3,905,599, 4,613,696 and 9,156,898 shares of common stock on the open market in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, for\n$504.3 million, $647.5 million and $950.0 million, respectively. At February 3, 2024, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our existing $2.5 billion Board repurchase\nauthorization.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nFixed Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan permitted us to grant to our employees, consultants and directors up to4 .0 million shares of our common stock plus any shares available\nunder former plans which were previously approved by the shareholders. The plan permitted us to grant equity awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, service-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance bonuses, performance-based restricted stock units\n(“PSUs”), non-employee director stock options and other equity-related awards. As of March 17, 2021, the plan was no longer available for new grants of awards, but all\noutstanding awards that were granted under the plan prior to March 17, 2021 continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the plan and applicable award agreements.\nEffective June 10, 2021, the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan was replaced and superseded by the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”). The Omnibus Plan permits us\nto grant up to 6.5 million shares of our common stock to our employees, consultants and directors. The form of equity awards authorized for grant under the Omnibus Plan are\nsubstantially the same as those permitted by the predecessor plan.\nAny restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs awarded are subject to certain general restrictions. The restricted stock shares or units may not be sold, transferred, pledged or\ndisposed of until the restrictions on the shares or units have lapsed or have been removed under the provisions of the Omnibus Plan. In addition, if a holder of restricted shares\nor units ceases to be employed by us, any shares or units in which the restrictions have not lapsed will be forfeited.\nPrior to July 1, 2023, the 2013 Director Deferred Compensation Plan permitted our directors to defer all or a portion of fees for Board or Board committee service until a\nfuture date, at which time they may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, or receive all or a portion of such fees in non-statutory stock options. Deferred fees that are\npaid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. Deferred amounts to be paid in common stock are determined by dividing the deferred fee amount by the\nclosing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of deferral. The number of options issued to a director will equal the deferred fee amount divided by 33% of the\nprice of a share of our common stock. The exercise price will equal the fair market value of our common stock at the date the option is issued. The options are fully vested when\nissued and have a term of 10 years. The 2013 plan expired on June 30, 2023. All amounts deferred by directors pursuant to the terms of the 2013 plan on or before June 30, 2023\nwill continue to be administered in accordance with the terms of the 2013 plan and applicable deferral elections.\nBeginning July 1, 2023, our non-employee directors are permitted to defer all or a part of fees earned for his or her service as a director pursuant to our Non-Employee\nDirector Deferred Compensation Program, which operates in conjunction with, and under the authority of, the Omnibus Plan. Pursuant to this program, cash fees may be\ndeferred into either a cash account or a phantom stock account, and annual equity awards for service as a director may be deferred into the director’s phantom stock account.\nDeferred fees that are paid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. Deferred amounts to be paid in common stock are determined by dividing the\ndeferred fee amount by the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of deferral.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nCost of sales $ 22.4 $ 19.7 $ 18.3\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 74.3 90.7 61.6\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 96.7 $ 110.4 $ 79.9\nExcess tax benefit on stock-based compensation recognized\nin the provision for income taxes $ 3.9 $ 9.8 $ 8.5\nRestricted Stock\nWe issue RSUs to employees and officers and issue PSUs to certain of our officers. We recognize expense based on the estimated fair value of the RSUs or PSUs granted\nover the requisite service period, which is generally three years, on a straight-line basis or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. For PSUs, the\ncompensation expense recorded is re-evaluated at each reporting period and adjusted, as necessary, based on the probability of achieving the performance criteria.\n62\nTable of Contents\nRSUs\nThe fair value of RSUs is determined based on our closing stock price on the grant date.T he following table summarizes the status of RSUs as of February 3, 2024 and\nchanges during the year then ended:\nWeighted Average Grant\nNumber of RSUs Date Fair Value\nNonvested at January 28, 2023 868,720 $ 123.99\nGranted 550,132 141.70\nVested (486,439) 110.56\nForfeited (93,227) 141.20\nNonvested at February 3, 2024 839,186 $ 141.45\nThe total fair value of the RSUs vested during the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was $53.8 million, $51.5 million and $56.8\nmillion, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs granted in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $141.70, $158.05 and $109.01,\nrespectively. As of February 3, 2024, there was $65.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding RSUs which is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.\nPSUs\nHistorically, we have granted PSUs that have a service and performance condition. The fair value of these awards is determined based on our closing stock price on the\ngrant date. In fiscal 2023, we granted PSUs that cliff vest at the end of three years and that contain a market condition modifier, in addition to having a service and performance\ncondition. The market condition modifier can adjust the number of shares that vest under the award based on a comparison of our total shareholder return to that of a designated\npeer group over the performance period. The fair value of these awards incorporating the market condition was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation\nmodel with the following weighted average assumptions:\nFiscal 2023\nExpected term (in years) 2.8\nExpected stock price volatility 34.5 %\nDividend yield — %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.82 %\nThe expected stock price volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our common stock over a period matching the expected term of the awards granted.\nThe dividend yield reflects that we have never paid cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury zero-\ncoupon securities with maturities that approximate the expected term of the awards.\nThe following table summarizes the status of PSUs as of February 3, 2024 and changes during the year then ended:\nWeighted Average Grant\nNumber of PSUs Date Fair Value\nNonvested at January 28, 2023 154,823 $ 125.84\nGranted 122,419 129.24\nVested (96,508) 89.81\nForfeited (30,584) 129.29\nNonvested at February 3, 2024 150,150 $ 147.29\nThe total fair value of the PSUs vested during the years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was $8.7 million, $44.5 million and $17.3 million,\nrespectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the PSUs granted in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $129.24, $159.57 and $95.04, respectively. As of\nFebruary 3, 2024, there was $3.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these PSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period\nof 1.1 years. We assess the probability of the achievement of the remaining performance targets at the end of each reporting period and based on that assessment, cumulative\nadjustments may be recorded in future periods.\n63\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nHistorically, we have not used stock options broadly as part of our compensation strategy. In fiscal 2023, we began to issue stock options to certain key executives. These\nawards generally have a ten-year term and vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the employees’ continued employment\nwith the company through each vesting date. Stock options granted in fiscal 2023 had a fair value of $4.9 million.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2022, we granted a one-time award of options to purchase2 ,252,587 shares of our common stock at a fair value of $135.6 million to the Executive\nChairman of the Board, who was also appointed Chief Executive Officer of the company effective January 29, 2023. The grant of options was subject to the terms and\nconditions of a five-year Executive Agreement. The option award has a ten-year term and is scheduled to vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of the\ngrant date, subject to the Executive Chairman’s continued employment with the company through each vesting date.\nOptions granted in fiscal 2021 were immaterial.\nStock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the executive stock options granted in fiscal 2023 and the assumptions used for the\nfiscal 2022 award granted to the Executive Chairmain are as follows:\nFiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nExpected term (in years) 6.0 6.5\nExpected stock price volatility 36.3 % 34.1 %\nDividend yield — % — %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.81 % 2.15 %\nThe simplified method was used to estimate the expected term of the options due to our lack of historical option exercise experience and the “plain vanilla” characteristics\nof the option awards. The simplified method results in an expected term equal to the average of the weighted average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The\nexpected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period matching the expected term of the options granted. The dividend yield\nreflects that we have never paid cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with\nmaturities that approximate the expected term of the options.\nPrior to July 1, 2023, certain of our directors elected to defer their compensation into stock options under the 2013 Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These options\nvested immediately and were expensed on the grant date.\nThe following tables summarize information about options outstanding at February 3, 2024 and changes during the year then ended:\nWeighted Average Aggregate Intrinsic\nPer Share Exercise Weighted Average Value\nNumber of Shares Price Remaining Term (Years) (in millions)\nOutstanding at January 28, 2023 2,276,937 $ 156.46\nGranted 85,447 137.93\nExercised (1,207) 77.59\nForfeited (1,075) 143.55\nOutstanding at February 3, 2024 2,360,102 $ 155.84 8.1 $ 1.5\nExercisable at February 3, 2024 475,810 $ 153.92 7.9 $ 1.1\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively. As of\nFebruary 3, 2024, there was $87.5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of 3.1 years.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the calculations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:\nYear Ended\n(in millions, except per share data) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nBasic net income (loss) per share:\nNet income (loss) $ (998.4) $ 1,615.4 $ 1,327.9\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 219.5 223.2 227.9\nBasic net income (loss) per share $ (4.55) $ 7.24 $ 5.83\nDiluted net income (loss) per share:\nNet income (loss) $ (998.4) $ 1,615.4 $ 1,327.9\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 219.5 223.2 227.9\nDilutive impact of share-based awards (as determined by applying the\ntreasury stock method) — 0.9 1.1\nWeighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares\noutstanding 219.5 224.1 229.0\nDiluted net income (loss) per share $ (4.55) $ 7.21 $ 5.80\nFor the years ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, share-based awards of 2.9 million shares and 3.0 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended January 29, 2022, substantially all of the outstanding share-\nbased awards were included in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding.\nNote 12 – Employee Benefit Plan\nDollar Tree Retirement Savings Plan\nWe maintain a 401(k) plan which is available to all full-time, United States-based employees who are at least1 8 years of age. Eligible employees may make elective salary\ndeferrals. We make contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar match on the first five percent of employee contributions to eligible employees who have completed one year\nof service in which they have worked at least 1,000 hours.\nContributions to and reimbursements by us of expenses of the plan were recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nCost of sales $ 9.9 $ 8.6 $ 8.2\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 26.0 23.1 20.6\nTotal $ 35.9 $ 31.7 $ 28.8\nAll eligible employees are immediately vested in any company match contributions under the 401(k) plan.\nNote 13 – Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\nWe operate more than 16,700 retail discount stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces. Our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree\nand Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our CODM regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.\n65\nTable of Contents\nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment’s net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). The CODM reviews these metrics\nfor each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income (loss), as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the\nCODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation. Corporate, support\nand other consists primarily of store support center costs and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia that are considered shared\nservices and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. The Family Dollar segment operating income\n(loss) includes advertising revenue, which is a component of “Other revenue” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInformation for our segments, as well as for corporate, support and other, including the reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes, is as follows:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nNet sales:\nDollar Tree $ 16,770.3 $ 15,405.7 $ 13,922.1\nFamily Dollar 13,811.3 12,912.5 12,387.7\nConsolidated net sales $ 30,581.6 $ 28,318.2 $ 26,309.8\nGross profit:\nDollar Tree $ 6,008.9 $ 5,775.5 $ 4,603.6\nFamily Dollar 3,300.7 3,146.4 3,122.3\nConsolidated gross profit $ 9,309.6 $ 8,921.9 $ 7,725.9\nOperating income (loss):\nDollar Tree $ 2,278.8 $ 2,536.0 $ 1,607.0\nFamily Dollar (2,663.5) 127.5 543.1\nCorporate, support and other (497.1) (427.2) (338.7)\nConsolidated operating income (loss) (881.8) 2,236.3 1,811.4\nInterest expense, net 106.8 125.3 178.9\nOther expense, net 0.1 0.4 0.3\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ (988.7) $ 2,110.6 $ 1,632.2\nDepreciation and amortization expense:\nDollar Tree $ 370.5 $ 338.8 $ 316.0\nFamily Dollar 440.4 402.4 369.8\nCorporate, support and other 30.4 26.8 30.2\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization expense $ 841.3 $ 768.0 $ 716.0\n66\nTable of Contents\nAs of\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Data:\nGoodwill:\nDollar Tree $ 423.3 $ 423.6\nFamily Dollar 490.5 1,559.5\nConsolidated goodwill $ 913.8 $ 1,983.1\nTotal assets:\nDollar Tree $ 10,315.9 $ 9,914.6\nFamily Dollar 11,037.0 12,562.2\nCorporate, support and other 670.6 545.3\nConsolidated total assets $ 22,023.5 $ 23,022.1\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment:\nDollar Tree $ 993.5 $ 548.7\nFamily Dollar 995.2 605.2\nCorporate, support and other 112.6 94.9\nConsolidated additions to property, plant and equipment $ 2,101.3 $ 1,248.8\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe following table summarizes net sales by merchandise category for our segments:\nYear Ended\n(in millions) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nDollar Tree segment net sales by\nmerchandise category:\nConsumable $ 7,915.6 47.2 % $ 6,978.8 45.3 % $ 6,334.5 45.5 %\nVariety 7,781.4 46.4 % 7,456.3 48.4 % 6,794.0 48.8 %\nSeasonal 1,073.3 6.4 % 970.6 6.3 % 793.6 5.7 %\nTotal Dollar Tree segment net sales $ 16,770.3 100.0 % $ 15,405.7 100.0 % $ 13,922.1 100.0 %\nFamily Dollar segment net sales by\nmerchandise category:\nConsumable $ 11,086.1 80.3 % $ 10,036.2 77.7 % $ 9,446.5 76.3 %\nHome products 930.0 6.7 % 982.5 7.6 % 1,033.9 8.3 %\nApparel and accessories 673.4 4.9 % 732.2 5.7 % 781.5 6.3 %\nSeasonal and electronics 1,121.8 8.1 % 1,161.6 9.0 % 1,125.8 9.1 %\nTotal Family Dollar segment net sales $ 13,811.3 100.0 % $ 12,912.5 100.0 % $ 12,387.7 100.0 %\nNote 14 – Supply Chain Finance Program\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we implemented a supply chain finance program, administered through a financial institution, which provides participating suppliers\nwith the opportunity to finance payments due from us. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to finance one or more invoices of ours prior to their scheduled\ndue dates at a discounted price with the financial institution.\n67\nTable of Contents\nOur obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decision to finance amounts under these\narrangements. As such, the outstanding payment obligations under our supply chain financing program are included within “Accounts payable” in the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and within “Cash flows from operating activities” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of February 3, 2024, our outstanding payment obligations under this program were $11.8 million.\nNote 15 – Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets\nImpairments\nIn connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter, and as a result of the anticipated store closures\ndescribed in Note 16, we determined it was more likely than not that an impairment loss had been incurred with respect to the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name, and\nproceeded to perform a quantitative impairment test of both assets. We estimated, with the assistance of a third party specialist, the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name\nbased on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. The significant estimates used in the relief-from-royalty method, which are level 3 inputs, include a\ncompany-specific royalty rate, our weighted average cost of capital adjusted by a company-specific risk premium and trade name premium. The valuation date for the Family\nDollar trade name was November 25, 2023. The results of the impairment test showed that the carrying value of the Family Dollar trade name exceeded its estimated fair value\nresulting in the recognition of a $950.0 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which is recorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSubsequent to the Family Dollar trade name and long-lived asset impairment tests, we estimated, with the assistance of a third party specialist, the fair value of the Family\nDollar reporting unit using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow method,\nwhich are level 3 inputs, include our weighted average cost of capital adjusted by a company-specific risk premium, long-term rates of growth and profitability for the Family\nDollar reporting unit, working capital effects, and changes in market conditions, consumer trends and strategy. The market multiple method utilized comparable public\ncompany revenue and profitability multiples to estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit. The valuation date for the Family Dollar reporting unit was November\n25, 2023. The annual goodwill impairment evaluation in 2023 showed that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in the\nrecognition of a $1,069.0 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe annual goodwill and nonamortizing intangible asset impairment evaluations in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 did not result in impairment.\nWe have recorded cumulative goodwill impairment charges totaling $4,109.0 million, all of which relate to the Family Dollar reporting unit and recorded during the fourth\nquarters of fiscal 2023 ($1,069.0 million), fiscal 2019 ($313.0 million), and fiscal 2018 ($2,727.0 million).\nGoodwill\nGoodwill allocated to our reportable segments and changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 are as\nfollows:\n(in millions) Dollar Tree Family Dollar Total\nBalance at January 29, 2022 $ 424.9 $ 1,559.5 $ 1,984.4\nForeign currency translation adjustments (1.3) — (1.3)\nBalance at January 28, 2023 423.6 1,559.5 1,983.1\nForeign currency translation adjustments (0.3) — (0.3)\nGoodwill impairment — (1,069.0) (1,069.0)\nBalance at February 3, 2024 $ 423.3 $ 490.5 $ 913.8\nNote 16 – Store Portfolio Optimization Review\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for\nclosure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of this portfolio\noptimization review, we plan to close approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024,\nand approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. Additionally, we identified approximately 30 underperforming Dollar Tree stores for\nclosure and plan to close each store at the end of the store's current lease term.\n68\nTable of Contents\nWe performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis on each individual store’s asset group, and determined that certain store asset groups had net carrying values that\nexceeded their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Accordingly, we estimated the fair values of the asset groups based on a discounted cash flow method. For stores that\nare closing in the first half of fiscal 2024, we estimated the remaining fair value of the asset groups taking into account our ability to generate sublease income or lease\ntermination benefits prior to the end of the lease term. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow methodology, which are based on level 3 inputs, include our\nexpectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The valuation date for estimating the fair value of the long-lived assets for these stores was November 25, 2023.\nAs a result of the impairment test for the long-lived assets, we incurred $503.9 million of non-cash impairment charges which are included in “Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses” within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of $152.2 million of property, plant and equipment impairment charges\nand $351.7 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment charges. The operating lease ROU asset impairment does not relieve us of our monthly cash payment obligations\nunder the lease. We will pursue lease terminations or subleases where practicable. In addition, we recorded $80.6 million of inventory markdowns and $5.6 million of\ncapitalized distribution cost impairment within “Cost of sales” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the stores expected to close in the first half of\nfiscal 2024. We also incurred $4.3 million in third party consulting fees related to the portfolio optimization review which are included in “Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses” within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n69\nTable of Contents\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter\nhow well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply our\njudgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management has carried out, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of February 3, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and functioning effectively to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our\nmanagement conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of February 3, 2024, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears below.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nWe are undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating our core merchandise, warehouse management, point-of-sale, and human capital\nmanagement systems. These updates are expected to continue over the next few years and management will continue to evaluate the design and implementation of our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting as the transformation continues. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n70\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nDollar Tree, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Dollar Tree, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for\neach of the years in the three‑year period ended February 3, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 20,\n2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nVirginia Beach, Virginia\nMarch 20, 2024\n71\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

(the “Company”) believes thati t is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which provides for ther ecoupment of certain executive compensation in certain events (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended( the “Exchange Act”) and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Board will disclose the circumstances of any recoupment required by law or determined by it to be in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders. Any determinations required hereunder shall be made by Pthoeli cByo, aarnd “oarc, cifo uson tdinegsi grensattaetdem, beyn tt”h ein Ccloumdepse nasnayt iroenqC uoimremd aicttceoeu onft itnhge rBeostaartde manedn ta tnoy c sourcrehc dt eatne remrrionra tiino np rsehvaiollu bsely f iinssaul eadn dfi nbainndciinagl sotant eamll eanfftse cthteadt iinsd imviadtuearlisa.l tCoo tvheer epdre Evixoeucsultyi visessu Tehdi sf iPnoalniccyia la pstpaltieems eton ttsh,e o Cr othmatp wanoyu’lsd c ruersruelnt ti nan ad m foartmereiarl m exisesctautteivmee onftf iifc ethrse (ewrriothri nw ethree comrereacntiendg ionf tRheu lceu 1rr0eDnt- 1p eurniodde ro trh lee fEt xucnhcaonrgreec Atecdt iann tdh eth ceu lrirsetinntpg e srtiaondd.ards of the Nasdaq Stock Market) (“Covered Executives”).R ecoupment; Accounting RestatementI n the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reportingr equirement under the securities laws, the Board reasonably promptly will require recoupment of any erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement and such additional periods as may be required under Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act or the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Recoupment under this Policy will be required on a “no fault” basis, without regard to whether any misconduct occurred or a Covered Executive’s responsibility for the erroneous financial statements. For purposes of this\n\n2 Incentive Compensation For purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means incentive-based compensation (within the meaning of Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market), including, without limitation, any of the following;p rovided that, such compensation is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of -one or more financial reporting measures: • Cash bonuses; • Other short- and long-term cash awards; • Stock options; • Stock appreciation rights; • Restricted stock;• Restricted stock units; • Performance stock units; and• Other stock-based awards.F inancial reporting measures include any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, or any measure derived wholly or in part from such measures (including non-GAAP financialm easures), or the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return. Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery The amount of erroneously awarded compensation to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid, as determined by the Board. For Incentive Compensation based on the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return, if the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return. Method of Recoupment The Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping IncentiveC ompensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation: • requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid; • seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n\n3 • offsetting, to the extent required for compliance with Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“409A”), against any compensation otherwise owed or payable byt he Company to the Covered Executive at the time such compensation would otherwise be payable; • withholding future incentive compensation awards and equity awards; • cancelling (at a time permissible under 409A, if applicable) outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or • taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.N o Indemnification The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation under this Policy. Interpretation The Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make alld eterminations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It isi ntended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Effective Date This Policy, as amended, is effective as of April 15, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date. Amendment; Termination The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary.
