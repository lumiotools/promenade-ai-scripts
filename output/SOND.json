Receives Notification of Deficiency from Nasdaq Related to Delayed Filing of Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\n\nNovember 26, 2024 at 8:00 AM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9416/pdf)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Sonder Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SOND) (“Sonder” or the “Company”)** today announced that it received an expected deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on November 20, 2024 (the \"Notice\"). The Notice indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) as a result of its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Q3 Form 10-Q”), as described more fully in the Company's Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing (the “Form 12b-25”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on November 14, 2024. The Listing Rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC.\n\nIn accordance with Nasdaq’s listing rules, the Company has 60 calendar days after the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. Following receipt of such plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Q3 Form 10-Q’s due date, or until May 19, 2025, for the Company to regain compliance. The Company intends to submit a compliance plan to Nasdaq and take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules as soon as practicable.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the filing of the Q3 Form 10-Q was delayed due to the matters described in the Form 12b-25, including to allow the Company sufficient time to complete its customary accounting and internal control processes and procedures. While the Company can provide no assurances as to timing, the Company will continue to work diligently to complete and file the Q3 Form 10-Q as soon as practicable. The Nasdaq also provided the Company with an amended compliance letter that does not include a requirement that it be subject to a Panel Monitor.\n\n**_About Sonder_**\n\nSonder (NASDAQ: SOND) is a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler.

(NASDAQ: SOND or “Sonder”), a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartment-style accommodations serving the modern traveler, today announced that the Company has met all required closing conditions and is actively in the process of completing the convertible preferred equity transaction whereby a consortium of investors purchased approximately $43 million of a newly designated series of convertible preferred equity (the “Preferred Equity”). $14.7 million of the $43 million Preferred Equity was purchased on or about August 13, 2024, $12.8 million was purchased on or about November 7, 2024, and the Company expects that the remainder of the Preferred Equity will be purchased in the near term.\n\nThe additional liquidity will support the Company’s long-term profitable growth and the integration efforts under the recently announced [strategic licensing agreement with Marriott International](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a4plX_5NOfPZtQVmLit0H1BJXWQ3XdBb7NHK0jLI9w2g9dxYKVlm6qa7MirYPtoIc95ywGlsMnWv8_L_M6OmAHIGDOyboHPhseCpjUCZIPy7LArwDSWdkYMGseEektO7W51msPr0TzRBlBUuEOeHSWDtRqNksMSY3fGQR3hXLRFnAEiEmQxUuc2qb-ZTu7WZ_4tRwH9znxPnYowr_Ud1mGkFsh-X8kUhWFD7Yvm6pxRnwg9X3NJjqlQvh-k3AhN_J5Aj_Bom21Tug4kCwkO06w==). With this Preferred Equity transaction, as well as the previously announced balance sheet actions taken, Sonder will enhance its liquidity profile by approximately $146 million to support its long-term profitable growth.\n\nFrancis Davidson, Co-Founder and CEO of Sonder, said, “We are making meaningful progress executing against our growth plans, including completing the first phase of our integration with Marriott International with Sonder now listed as a Marriott Bonvoy® brand featured on Marriott International’s direct channels. With closing the second tranche of our preferred equity investment nearly complete, we are moving forward with a significantly stronger balance sheet and access to an additional $146 million in capital.”\n\n**Executive Leadership Transitions**\n\nSonder also announced the following changes to its executive leadership team:\n\n  * Dominique Bourgault, Sonder’s Chief Financial Officer, will step down from Sonder to pursue other opportunities, effective December 2, 2024. Adam Bowen, Sonder’s Chief Accounting Officer, will also depart the Company on December 31, 2024. The Company has initiated a search process with a leading search firm to identify a successor for the CFO role.\n  * Katherine Potter, Sonder’s Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, will step down from the Company, effective November 22, 2024, to accept another opportunity. Vanessa Barmack, Sonder’s Associate General Counsel, will serve as interim General Counsel and will assume responsibility for the Company’s Legal function.\n\n\n\nDavidson continued, “Dom, Katie and Adam have been true partners and each continue to make meaningful contributions to the critical work underway to fortify our financial position and reposition the Company for long-term growth. Sonder has accomplished notable recent milestones across our finance, legal and people functions, and Katie, Dom and Adam have been integral to each and I wish them nothing but the best. With the critical pieces of the transformation behind us and an incredibly talented and deep team, we have full confidence that our transition plans will be seamless and that the future of Sonder is bright.”\n\nBourgault said, “I am deeply proud of the transformational achievements we have made across the Company and the finance organization to position Sonder for success as it enters the next phase of its growth. I have full confidence in the team’s ability to execute Sonder’s strategy going forward.”\n\nPotter said, “Our legal and people functions have made tremendous strides in the past year and we have successfully supported the initiatives underway across the business, particularly the recently announced transformational transactions. I look forward to seeing all that the team will accomplish in the future.”\n\nAs disclosed on November 4, 2024, Sonder filed its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. With these filings now complete, the Company is now current on all financial reporting following the restatement of Sonder’s 2022 and 2023 financial information and is now in full compliance with all Nasdaq requirements.\n\n**About Sonder**\n\nSonder (NASDAQ: SOND) is a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler.

Receives Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter; Has Requested Hearing Before Hearings Panel\n\nOctober 7, 2024 at 4:18 PM EDT\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9306/pdf)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Sonder Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SOND, “Sonder” or the “Company”)** today announced that it has received a letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that since it remains delinquent in filing its Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2024 (the “Forms 10-Q”), respectively (the “Delinquent Filings”), the Staff has determined that the Company is non-compliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Previously, the Staff granted the Company an exception until September 30, 2024, to file all delinquent periodic reports. Additionally, the Company was previously deemed delayed on the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”); however, the Company has since filed the 2023 Form 10-K on September 27, 2024, and the Staff determined that the Company complies with respect to the 2023 Form 10-K. As a result of the Delinquent Filings, the Company’s common stock and warrants are subject to suspension in trading on October 10, 2024, and delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company appeals and requests a hearing before a Hearings Panel (“Hearings Panel”) by 4:00 Eastern Time on October 8, 2024.\n\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company submitted an appeal to Nasdaq requesting a hearing before a Hearings Panel at which it intends to present its plan to regain and thereafter maintain compliance with all applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. The appeal automatically suspends any potential delisting through at least October 23, 2024, 15 calendar days from the date the request for hearing was due. In connection with its request for a hearing, however, the Company has also requested a stay of the suspension of trading and delisting of its common stock and warrants, pending the later hearing and decision of the Hearings Panel. The Company has been informed that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. The Company intends to file the Forms 10-Q in the next 30-45 days. A panel will notify the Company by October 18, 2024, of its decision to allow the Company to continue to trade on Nasdaq pending the later hearing and a decision by the Hearings Panel. There can be no assurance that the panel will grant the Company’s request for continued listing or stay the delisting of its common stock and warrants and there can be no assurance that the Company will file the Forms 10-Q by the hearing’s scheduled date.\n\n**_About Sonder_**\n\nSonder (NASDAQ: SOND) is a leading global brand of premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler.
