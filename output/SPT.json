If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.\n\nThe Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating income, net loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net income per share, or operating margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Non-GAAP operating margin, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income per share and non-GAAP operating margin and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items. These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe financial results and business highlights will be discussed on a conference call and webcast scheduled at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today, November 7, 2024.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term model,” “may,” “medium to longer term goals,” “might” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q4 2024 and full year 2024 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, have and could continue to adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand; and risks related to ongoing legal proceedings. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, as well as any future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being heightened as a result of the current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\n**Non-GAAP gross profit.** We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from our acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. (the “Tagger acquisition”). We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP gross profit to exclude amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition.\n\n**Non-GAAP gross margin.** We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Non-GAAP operating income (loss).** We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\n**Non-GAAP operating margin.** We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income (loss).** We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.** We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.\n\n**Non-GAAP free cash flow.** We define non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest, is not available for strategic initiatives. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to acquisition-related costs associated with the Tagger acquisition (which are not applicable for the periods presented) and cash paid for interest on our revolving line of credit.\n\n**Non-GAAP free cash flow margin.** We define non-GAAP free cash flow margin as non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses.** Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses are defined as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively, less stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors with insight into day-to-day operating expenses given that these measures eliminate the effect of stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\n**Key Business Metrics**\n\n**Annual recurring revenue (“ARR”).** We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period. We believe ARR is an indicator of the scale of our entire platform while mitigating fluctuations due to seasonality and contract term.\n\n**Remaining performance obligations (“RPO”).** RPO, or remaining performance obligations, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods.\n\n**Current remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”).** cRPO, or current RPO, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in the next 12 months.\n\n**Number of customers.** We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe that the number of customers using our platform is an indicator of our market penetration.\n\n**Number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR.** We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\n**Number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR.** We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with large customers and attract sophisticated organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\n**Dollar-based net retention rate.** We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\n**Dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers.** We calculate dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers by dividing the ARR from all customers excluding ARR from customers that we have identified or that self-identified as having less than 50 employees as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st of the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We used dollar-based net retention excluding SMB customers to evaluate the long-term value of our larger customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nWhile we no longer believe that ARR and number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s business, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity.\n\n**Availability of Information on Sprout Social’s Website and Social Media Profiles**\n\nInvestors and others should note that Sprout Social routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Sprout Social Investors website.

          "content": "Investor\nPresentation\n3Q FY24\nDisclaimers\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In some cases, you can identify\nforward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term operating model,” “medium to long-term goals,” “may,” “might” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,”\n“project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These\nstatements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q4 2024, 2024, medium term, and long-term financial outlook and\nperformance against our multi-year financial framework, our medium to longer term goals, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies, including our investments in research and development. By their nature, these\nstatements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking\nstatements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others; we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our\nproducts, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or\ncertain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we\nmay be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve\nthe expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential\nfuture bank failures and ongoing overseas conflicts, have and could continue to adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to\ngenerate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely\nimpacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; changing regulations relating to privacy, information security\nand data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand; and risks related to ongoing legal proceedings. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and\nresults to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, as supplemented by any future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being\nheightened as a result of the ongoing and current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time\nthose statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were\nmade, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided in this presentation certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures\ninternally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other\ncompanies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with\nGAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been\nprovided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this presentation, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations. The Company cannot provide reconciliations between its forecasted non-GAAP measures and the most\ncomparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items. These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future\nfinancial results.\nCustomer Metrics and Market Data\nThis presentation includes useful customer metrics and other data, which are defined at the back of this presentation. Unless otherwise noted, information in this presentation concerning our industry, including industry statistics and forecasts,\ncompetitive position and the markets in which we operate is based on information from independent industry and research organizations, other third-party sources and management estimates. Management estimates are derived from publicly\navailable information released by independent industry analysts and other third party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and are based on assumptions made by us upon reviewing such data, and our experience in, and knowledge\nof, such industry and markets, which we believe to be reasonable. Projections, forecasts, assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the industry in which we operate and our future performance are necessarily subject to uncertainty\nand risk due to a variety of factors. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by independent industry and research organizations, other third parties or other publicly available information.\nAccordingly, we make no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of that information nor do we undertake to update such information after the date of this presentation.\n2023 Investor Presentation 2\n3Q FY2024 Results\nFin Reporting Signoff:\nNAME: Brian Flynn\nDATE: 10/24/2024\n26% 20%\nACV Growth Revenue Growth\n~30,000\nCustomers in 100+ countries\n99% 77%\nSubscription Gross Profit\nRevenue\n*All financial metrics are as of or for the quarter ended 9/30/24.

We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period.\nNon-GAAP gross profit. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger Media, Inc. acquisition. We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors\nconsistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP\ngross profit to exclude amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition.\nNon-GAAP gross margin. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP\noperating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and\namortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with our acquisition of Tagger and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the\nTagger acquisition.\nNon-GAAP operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances\nfrom business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based\ncompensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in\nconnection with our acquisition of Tagger, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets\nfrom the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of\noperations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our\ndefinition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with our acquisition of Tagger, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with\nour acquisition of Tagger.\nNon-GAAP free cash flow. Non-GAAP free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or\nrepresent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment,\nacquisition-related costs and interest, is not available for strategic initiatives. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to acquisition-related costs associated with our acquisition of Tagger and cash paid for interest on our revolving line of credit.\nNon-GAAP free cash flow margin (Non-GAAP FCF Margin). We define non-GAAP free cash flow margin as non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\nDollar-based net retention rate. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the organic ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the organic ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or\nexpansion during the period but excludes organic ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\nAverage Contract Value (ACV). We define ACV as the ending period total ARR divided by the ending period total customer count.\nLTV:CAC. We calculate the lifetime value of our customers and associated customer acquisition costs for a particular year by comparing (i) gross profit from net new ARR for the year divided by one minus the estimated subscription renewal rate to (ii) total sales and marketing expense incurred in the preceding year.\nNumber of customers. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity.\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of\nour ability to scale with our customers. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure\nof our ability to scale with large customers and attract sophisticated organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\nWe calculated our current >$55B Served Addressable Market estimate as follows: (i) utilized data from The US SBA, The US Census Bureau, The OECD and Statista to estimate the total number of businesses in the United States and globally in each of our served market segments (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB); (ii)\nutilized internal data and third party estimates to estimate of the number of such businesses that require a social media management platform (the “Target Businesses”); (iii) calculated the average of our ACV and our estimate of our direct competitors’ ACVs in each segment; and (iv) multiplied the estimated average\nsegment ACVs by the estimated number of Target Businesses in each applicable segment.\nWe calculated our >$120B Total Addressable Market estimate using the methodology above. We then used internal estimates informed by research from the Harris Poll to determine the projected business presence on social media in 2025 that will require a social media management platform, multiplied by our internal\nprojected average segment ACVs in 2025 for Sprout Social and its direct competitors in the applicable segment.\nCurrent Penetration of our Served Addressable Market. We estimate the current total revenue of SPT and each of our primary competitors and divide by our current SAM to determine current market penetration.\nRemaining performance obligations (“RPO”). RPO, or remaining performance obligations, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods.\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”). cRPO, or current RPO, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in the next 12 months.\n36"

Exhibits 53\nSIGNATURES 54\n1\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) not based on historical facts are “forward-looking\nstatements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements\ninclude statements about Sprout Social, Inc.’s (“Sprout Social”) plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook,\ntrends, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual\nfinancial results, performance, achievements or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-\nlooking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “anticipate,”\n“believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term model,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “plan,”\n“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions\nintended to identify forward-looking statements, as they relate to Sprout Social, our business and our management. Forward-\nlooking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Sprout Social\nand our management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain. These\nforward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and stockholders should not place\nundue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements\ncontained in this Quarterly Report. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others, the risks,\nuncertainties and factors set forth under “Part I—Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I—Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and the risks\nand uncertainties related to the following:\n• our ability to attract, retain, and grow customers;\n• our future financial performance, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, ability to\ngenerate positive cash flow, and ability to achieve and maintain profitability;\n• our ability to access third-party APIs and data on favorable terms;\n• our ability to increase spending of existing customers;\n• the evolution of the social media industry, including technological advances and adapting to new regulations and use\ncases;\n• the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies into our products, which may lead to increased governmental or\nregulatory scrutiny;\n• our ability to innovate and provide a superior customer experience;\n• our ability to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable laws\nand regulations;\n• our ability to successfully adapt our sales, success, and compliance efforts to the demands of sophisticated enterprise\ncustomers;\n• our ability to maintain and enhance our brand;\n• our estimates of the size of our market opportunities;\n• the effects of increased competition from our market competitors or new entrants to the market;\n• our ability to securely maintain customer and other third-party data;\n2\n• our ability to comply with existing, modified or new laws and regulations applying to our business, including data privacy\nand security regulations;\n• our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;\n• worldwide economic conditions, including the macroeconomic impacts of high levels of inflation, high interest rates and\nongoing overseas conflict, and their impact on demand for our platform and products;\n• our ability to acquire, invest in, and integrate other businesses or technologies into our business or achieve the expected\nbenefits of such acquisitions and technologies;\n• our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel;\n• our ability to manage our substantial debt in a way that does not adversely affect our business; and\n• the other factors set forth in our Annual Report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\non Form 10-K under Part I—Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nThese factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual financial results, performance,\nachievements or prospects to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of our forward-looking statements. Other\nunknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting\non our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. Forward-looking statements\nspeak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake or assume any obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, laws or other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to\nthe extent required by applicable laws. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that\nwe will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nIn addition, statements such as \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant\nsubject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this report. While we believe such\ninformation provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nSprout Social, Inc. (“Sprout Social” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, began operating on April 21, 2010 to\ndesign, develop and operate a web-based comprehensive social media management tool enabling companies to manage and\nmeasure their online presence. Customers access their accounts online via a web-based interface or a mobile application. Some\ncustomers also purchase the Company’s professional services, which primarily consist of consulting and training services. The\nCompany’s fiscal year end is December 31. The Company’s customers are primarily located throughout the United States, and a\nportion of customers are located in foreign countries. The Company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes were prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the applicable regulations of the United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The Company has prepared the\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a basis substantially consistent with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and these unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods\npresented but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the full year or any future period. The\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial\nstatements as of that date but does not include all disclosures including certain disclosures required by GAAP on an annual basis.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nfiled with the SEC on February 23, 2024.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that its management believes are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s estimates and judgments include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated period of benefit for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, the incremental borrowing\nrate for operating leases, calculation of allowance for credit losses, valuation of assets and liabilities acquired as part of business\ncombinations, useful lives of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, commitments and contingencies and\nlitigation, among others. The Company is not aware of any events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates\nand judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of November 8, 2024, the date of issuance of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n12\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 - “Nature of Operations and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 23, 2024. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nexcept as noted below.\nSales Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.\nSales commissions are paid on initial contracts with new customers and for expansion of contracts with existing customers.\nCommissions are not paid on customer renewals. Sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of benefit. The Company has historically estimated such period of benefit to be three years.\nOn an annual basis, the Company assesses the expected period of benefit by taking into consideration the products sold,\nmix of customers, expected customer life, expected contract renewals, technology life cycle and other factors. Based on the\nassessment performed during the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated the period of benefit from three years to five years.\nThis change in accounting estimate was effective January 1, 2024 and is being accounted for prospectively in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in amortization period\nresulted in a $3.4 million and $11.5 million reduction to sales and marketing expense, respectively, or an increase of $0.06 and\n$0.20 per share basic and diluted, respectively. The effects of this change in estimate were calculated based on the carrying value\nof deferred commissions as of December 31, 2023.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No.\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve\nreportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures for significant segment expenses. All\ndisclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for entities with a single reportable segment. The ASU is effective for the\nCompany’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, and interim periods thereafter, and should be applied on a retrospective basis\nto all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating these new disclosure requirements and\ndoes not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nto enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU will be effective for the Company\nbeginning with its annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025 and allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a\nretrospective option. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures.\n13\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n2. Revenue Recognition\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on geographic region in Note 8 - “Segment and Geographic\nData” of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) and based on the subscription versus\nprofessional services and other classification on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, as it believes these best\ndepict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue is recorded upon establishment of unconditional right to payment under non-cancellable contracts and\nis recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in advance in monthly,\nquarterly, semi-annual and annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the\ncompounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, timing and size. The amount of revenue recognized during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $70.1 million and\n$53.5 million, respectively. The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that\nwas included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $127.1 million and $87.7 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, including amounts already invoiced and amounts contracted but not yet invoiced, $311.5\nmillion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations, of which 71% is expected to be\nrecognized in the next 12 months, with the remainder thereafter.\n3. Operating Leases\nThe Company has operating lease agreements for offices in Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; Santa Monica,\nCalifornia; Dublin, Ireland; and Kraków, Poland. The Chicago lease expires in January 2028, the Seattle lease expires in January\n2031, the Santa Monica lease expires in January 2025, the Dublin lease expires in June 2025, and the Kraków lease expires in\nDecember 2029. These operating leases require monthly rental payments ranging from approximately $14,000 to $280,000.\nUnder the terms of the lease agreements, the Company is also responsible for its proportionate share of taxes and operating\ncosts, which are treated as variable lease costs. The Company’s operating leases typically contain options to extend or terminate\nthe term of the lease. The Company currently does not include any options to extend leases in its lease terms as it is not\nreasonably certain to exercise them. As such, it has recorded lease obligations only through the initial optional termination dates\nabove.\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for an office in Kraków, Poland. For accounting\npurposes under ASC 842, the lease commenced on August 30, 2024, resulting in the recording of a $0.6 million right-of-use\noperating lease asset and operating lease liability. The lease has an expected expiration date of December 2029.\n14\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nThe following table provides a summary of operating lease assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 8,003\nLiabilities\nOperating lease liabilities 3,913\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 12,835\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 16,748\nThe following table provides information about leases on the condensed consolidated statements of operations (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 703 $ 677 $ 2,076 $ 1,973\nVariable lease expense 863 893 2,575 2,679\nWithin the condensed consolidated statements of operations, operating and variable lease expense are recorded in\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Cash payments related to operating leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 were $6.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term\nis 4.4 years and the weighted-average discount rate is 5.6%.\nRemaining maturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nYears ending December 31,\n2024 $ 940\n2025 4,551\n2026 4,567\n2027 4,692\n2028 1,577\nThereafter 2,619\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 18,946\nLess: imputed interest (2,198)\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 16,748\n4. Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of the Company’s annual\neffective tax rate, excluding jurisdictions for which no tax benefit can be recognized due to valuation allowances. The Company’s\neffective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance related to the Company’s\nfederal and state deferred tax assets.\n15\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nThere is no provision for domestic income taxes because the Company has historically incurred operating losses and\nmaintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany recognized an immaterial provision related to foreign income taxes.\nThe Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets\nand whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary. The Company’s three-year cumulative loss position was significant\nnegative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The weight given to positive and negative evidence is\ncommensurate with the extent such evidence may be objectively verified. Given the weight of objectively verifiable historical\nlosses from operations, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. The Company may be\nable to reverse the valuation allowance when sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance.\n5. Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company,\nthe banks and other financial institutions or entities party thereto as lenders and MUFG Bank, LTD. as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), maturing\non August 1, 2028. Borrowings under the Facility may be used to finance acquisitions and other investments permitted under the\nterms of the Credit Agreement, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had an outstanding balance of $30.0 million under the Facility.\nBorrowings under the Facility may be designated as SOFR Loans or ABR Loans (each as defined in the Credit\nAgreement), subject to certain terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement, and bear interest at a rate of either (i) SOFR\n(subject to a 1.0% floor), plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25% based on the Company’s liquidity or (ii) ABR\n(subject to a 2.0% floor) plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% based on the Company’s liquidity. The Facility also includes\na quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Facility of 0.30% or 0.35% based on the Company’s liquidity. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, the borrowings under the Facility were designated as SOFR Loans and the weighted\naverage interest rate in effect for the outstanding balance was approximately 8.16%.\nDebt issuance costs associated with the Facility were recorded to Other assets, net within the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets and are being amortized as interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the Facility.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary conditions to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants, and\ncustomary events of default. The customary conditions also include restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur liens, incur\nindebtedness, make or hold investments, execute certain change of control transactions, business combinations or other\nfundamental changes to its business, dispose of assets, make certain types of restricted payments or enter into certain related\nparty transactions, subject to customary exceptions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants as to (i)\nminimum liquidity, requiring the maintenance, at all times and measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, of cash and cash\nequivalents of not less than the greater of (x) $30 million and (y) 30% of the total revolving commitments, and (ii) minimum\nrecurring revenue growth, requiring recurring revenue growth for the trailing four fiscal quarter period, measured at the end of\neach fiscal quarter, of not less than 115% of the actual recurring revenue for the same period in the prior fiscal year. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement.\n16\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n6. Incentive Stock Plan\nStock-based compensation expense is included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 1,059 $ 971 $ 2,890 $ 2,329\nResearch and development 7,493 5,020 18,979 12,949\nSales and marketing 8,962 8,570 24,527 22,346\nGeneral and administrative 5,672 4,452 15,454 11,421\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 23,186 $ 19,013 $ 61,850 $ 49,045\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has non-cancellable minimum guaranteed purchase commitments for primarily data and services. Material\ncontractual commitments as of September 30, 2024 that are not disclosed elsewhere are as follows (in thousands):\nYears ending December 31,\n2024 $ 2,223\n2025 6,800\n2026 2,672\n2027 611\n2028 —\nThereafter —\nTotal contractual obligations $ 12,306\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time in the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to various legal matters such as\nthreatened or pending claims or proceedings.\nBeginning on May 13, 2024, the Company and certain of its executives were named in two putative securities fraud class\naction cases filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting claims under Sections 10(b) and\n20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The first action, captioned Munch v. Sprout Social, Inc., et al. (the “Munch\nAction”), was filed on May 13, 2024 and alleges that the defendants made false or misleading statements and omissions of fact\nrelating to the Company’s business, operations and prospects, including (i) purported integration challenges arising from the\nCompany’s August 2023 acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. (“Tagger”), (ii) the Company’s ability to service (and the viability of its\nstrategic plan to focus on) the enterprise market, and (iii) as a result, the Company’s 2024 financial guidance was required to be\nadjusted downward. The plaintiff in the Munch\n17\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nAction seeks damages and costs on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders and alleges a class period beginning on\nNovember 3, 2023 and ending on May 2, 2024. The second case, captioned City of Hollywood Police Officers’ Retirement System\nv. Sprout Social, Inc., et al. (the “City of Hollywood Action” and, together with the Munch Action, the “Securities Actions”) was filed\non July 2, 2024. It asserts claims under the same statutory provisions based on substantially similar allegations of misconduct as\nthe Munch Action, but alleges a class period beginning on November 3, 2021 and ending on May 2, 2024.\nOn July 12, 2024, three purported Company stockholders, including the named plaintiffs in the Securities Actions, filed\nmotions to consolidate the Securities Actions and for appointment as lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995. Those motions remain pending. Based on a scheduling order entered by the Court in the first-filed Munch Action, the\nappointed lead plaintiff will have sixty days following a ruling on these motions to file a consolidated amended and/or consolidated\ncomplaint, after which Defendants will have sixty days to respond.\nOn September 3, 2024, a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit captioned Hannaway v. Sprout Social, Inc. et al., was\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Company’s directors and certain officers (the\n“Derivative Action” and, together with the Securities Actions, the “Actions”). The Derivative Action alleges that the defendants\nfailed to disclose (or misrepresented) facts about the Company’s business, operations and prospects, including that (i) the\nCompany’s sales and revenue results were not indicative of its growth as it transitioned to an enterprise sales cycle, (ii) the\nCompany was unable to sell to enterprise customers and thus overpaid for, and faced integration challenges with respect to,\nTagger, and (iii) as a result, the Company faced longer sales cycles and a slowing pipeline, requiring a downward revision of its\n2024 guidance. Based on these purported disclosure deficiencies and related alleged misconduct, plaintiff asserts federal claims\nunder Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 21D of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9, and state law claims for breach of fiduciary\nduties, unjust enrichment, corporate waste, aiding and abetting and insider selling, and seeks damages in an unspecified amount\non the Company’s behalf. On October 23, 2024, the court in the derivative action entered a stipulation and order staying the\nderivative action until the earliest of (i) entry of a final, non-appealable order on any summary judgment motions in the Securities\nActions; (ii) a settlement or other mediated resolution in the Securities Actions; or (iii) as otherwise agreed to by the Parties.\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in the Actions. The outcomes of these actions are\nsubject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The\nCompany could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these actions and may not prevail. The Company\ncurrently is not able to estimate the possible cost from these matters, as these actions are currently at an early stage, and the\nCompany cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these actions or the possible amount of any damages that the\nCompany may be required to pay. Such amounts could be material to the Company’s financial statements. The Company has not\nestablished any reserve for any potential liability relating to these actions. It is possible that the Company could, in the future,\nincur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages.\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company often includes standard indemnification provisions in its arrangements\nwith third parties, including vendors, customers, investors, and the Company’s directors and officers. Pursuant to these\nprovisions, the Company may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred. It is not possible to\ndetermine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of\n18\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. Historically, the\nCompany has not incurred any significant costs as a result of such indemnifications.\n8. Segment and Geographic Data\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its chief\nexecutive officer, who reviews financial information for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance\nand allocating resources. The Company’s CODM evaluates financial information on a consolidated basis. As the Company\noperates as one operating segment, all required segment financial information is found in the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nLong-lived assets by geographical region are based on the location of the legal entity that owns the assets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no significant long-lived assets held by entities outside of the United\nStates.\nRevenue by geographical region is determined by location of the Company’s customers. Revenue from customers\noutside of the United States was approximately 27% and 28% for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographical region is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmericas $ 81,482 $ 67,052 $ 236,982 $ 188,475\nEMEA 15,965 14,164 46,982 39,718\nAsia Pacific 5,191 4,316 14,854 11,866\nTotal $ 102,638 $ 85,532 $ 298,818 $ 240,059\n9. Net Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of\ncommon stock for each period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock\nequivalents, which includes stock options and restricted stock units. Because the Company incurred net losses each period, the\nbasic and diluted calculations are the same. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common stock,\nas both Class A and Class B stockholders are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\n19\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents the calculation for basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except share and per\nshare data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders $ (17,087) $ (23,013) $ (47,554) $ (46,350)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 57,179,710 55,831,230 56,742,498 55,508,195\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.30) $ (0.41) $ (0.84) $ (0.83)\nThe following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per\nshare for each period, as the impact of including them would have been anti-dilutive.\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options outstanding — 27,010\nRSUs outstanding 4,904,516 3,820,734\nTotal potentially dilutive shares 4,904,516 3,847,744\n20\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n10. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon the exit price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as\ndetermined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. Inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair\nvalues are classified based on a three-level hierarchy, as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices\nin markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe following tables present information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value and indicate the fair\nvalue hierarchy of the valuation inputs used (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nMarketable Securities:\nCorporate bonds $ — $ 8,125 $ — $ 8,125\nU.S. agency securities — 500 — 500\nTotal assets $ — $ 8,625 $ — $ 8,625\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nMarketable Securities:\nCommercial paper $ — $ 33,287 $ — $ 33,287\nCorporate bonds — 9,906 — 9,906\nU.S. Treasury securities — 495 — 495\nU.S. agency securities — 4,289 — 4,289\nAsset-backed securities — 367 — 367\nTotal assets $ — $ 48,344 $ — $ 48,344\nMarketable securities are classified within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are\ndirectly or indirectly observable in the market.\nThe carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash held in banks, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities and are\nexcluded from the fair value tables above.\nFor the periods presented, the Company held investment-grade marketable securities which were accounted for as\navailable-for-sale securities.

Business Combinations\nTagger Media, Inc.\nOn August 2, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of all the outstanding equity of Tagger, an influencer marketing\nand social intelligence platform. The Company acquired Tagger in order to expand into the influencer marketing category.\nTagger’s platform enables marketers to discover influencers, plan and manage campaigns, analyze competitor strategies, report\non trends and measure return on investment.\nThe Company acquired Tagger for a total final purchase consideration of $144 million in cash, which incorporates the\nimpact of various customary adjustments such as working capital, cash and indebtedness. The Company funded the purchase\nconsideration with a combination of cash on hand and $75 million borrowed under the Facility further described in Note 5 -\n“Revolving Line of Credit” of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report).\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, and is\nprimarily attributable to expanded market opportunities from integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company’s\nofferings. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions. The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in\nthousands):\nAugust 2, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,648\nAccounts receivable 2,979\nOther current and noncurrent assets 932\nIntangible assets 27,800\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities (1,758)\nDeferred revenue (3,243)\nNet assets acquired, excluding Goodwill 31,358\nGoodwill 112,405\nTotal consideration $ 143,763\nCash and cash equivalents acquired (4,648)\nCash paid for acquisition of business, net of cash acquired $ 139,115\nThe Company engaged a third-party valuation expert to aid its analysis of the acquired identifiable intangible assets. All\nestimates, key assumptions and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by the Company. While the Company chose to\nutilize a third-party valuation expert for assistance, the fair value analysis and related valuations reflect the conclusions of\nmanagement and not those of any third party.\n23\nSprout Social, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nThe fair values of the acquired technology and the trademark identified intangible assets were determined utilizing the\nrelief from royalty method under the income approach. The fair values of the customer relationships were valued using the multi-\nperiod excess-earnings method. The Company applied judgment which involved the use of assumptions with respect to revenue\ngrowth rates, customer attrition rate, discount rate, royalty rate, obsolescence rate and total operating expenses.\nAcquired intangible assets are being amortized over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

The\nacquisition has increased the Company’s power, breadth and automation of social listening, messaging, and customer care\ncapabilities with added sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and artificial-intelligence (AI).\nThe total final purchase consideration for the acquisition was $8.3 million, consisting of approximately $6.8 million in cash\npaid at the closing of the acquisition and a holdback of $1.5 million in cash to be paid as purchase consideration after the one-\nyear anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, assuming no claims by the Company against the holdback amount for post-\nclosing purchase price adjustments or indemnification matters. The purchase price holdback was paid in full in January 2024.\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, and is\nprimarily attributable to expected post-acquisition synergies from integrating the technology into Sprout’s platform. The goodwill is\nnot deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This\ndiscussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of\nvarious factors, including those set forth under Part I—Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and in other parts of this Quarterly Report. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)Z\nSprout Social is a powerful, centralized platform that provides the critical business layer to unlock the massive commercial\nvalue of social media. We have made it increasingly easy to standardize on Sprout Social as the centralized system of record for\nsocial and to help customers maximize the value of this mission critical channel. Currently, approximately 30,000 customers\nacross more than 100 countries rely on our platform.\nIntroduced in 2011, our cloud software brings together social messaging, data and workflows in a unified system of\nrecord, intelligence and action. Operating across major networks, including X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, Instagram,\nTikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, Glassdoor and YouTube, and commerce platforms Facebook Shops, Shopify and\nWooCommerce, we provide organizations with a centralized platform to manage their social media efforts across stakeholders\nand business functions. Virtually every aspect of business has been impacted by social media, from marketing, sales, commerce\nand public relations to customer service, product and strategy, creating a need for an entirely new category of software. We offer\nour customers a centralized, secure and powerful platform to manage this broad, complex channel effectively across their\norganization.\nWe generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our social media management platform under a software-as-a-\nservice model. Our subscriptions can range from monthly to one-year or multi-year arrangements and are generally non-\ncancellable during the contractual subscription term. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning\non the date the product is made available to customers, which typically begins on the commencement date of each contract. We\nalso generate revenue from professional services related to our platform provided to certain customers, which is recognized at the\ntime these services are provided to the customer. This revenue has historically represented less than 1% of our revenue and is\nexpected to be immaterial for the foreseeable future.\nOur tiered subscription-based model allows our customers to choose among three core plans to meet their needs. Each\nplan is licensed on a per user per month basis at prices dependent on the level of features offered. Additional product modules,\nwhich offer increased functionality depending on a customer’s needs, can be purchased by the customer on a per user per month\nbasis.\nWe generated revenue of $102.6 million and $85.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, representing growth of 20%. We generated revenue of $298.8 million and $240.1 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing growth of 24%. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nsoftware subscriptions contributed 99% of our revenue.\nWe generated net losses of $17.1(cid:0)(cid:3)million and $23.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $23.2 million and $19.0 million, respectively. We generated\nnet losses of $47.6 million and $46.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which\nincluded stock-based compensation expense of $61.9 million and $49.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue investing in\nthe growth of our business and, as a result, generate net losses for the foreseeable future.\n26\nImpact of Macroeconomic Conditions\nAs a company with a global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures caused by significant events and their\nmacroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, high levels of inflation, high interest rates, ongoing overseas conflict,\nvolatility in the capital markets and related market uncertainty. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts, and the\npotential for future impacts, of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy\nand geopolitical landscape.\nOur current and prospective customers are impacted by these macroeconomic conditions to varying degrees. Potentially\nas a result of these various macroeconomic impacts on our current and prospective customers, we periodically have experienced\nmore measured buying behavior by current and prospective customers and lengthening of the average sales cycle for certain\ntypes of customers and sales (including sales to prospective customers and expansion sales to current customers), which have\ncontributed to a slowdown in our revenue growth as compared to historical levels. We believe macroeconomic uncertainty could\npersist, and as a result, we expect that some or all of these negative trends may emerge or recur during future quarters.\nAcquisition of Tagger Media, Inc.\nOn August 2, 2023, we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding equity of Tagger Media, Inc. (“Tagger”), for a total\npurchase consideration of $144 million. We acquired Tagger in order to expand into the influencer marketing category. Tagger’s\nplatform enables marketers to discover influencers, plan and manage campaigns, analyze competitor strategies, report on trends\nand measure return on investment. We funded the purchase consideration with a combination of cash on hand and $75 million\nborrowed under the revolving credit facility further described in Note 5 - “Revolving Line of Credit” of the Notes to the Financial\nStatements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report).\nThe fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions. The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nWe have included the financial results of Tagger in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of\nacquisition. Refer to Note 11 - “Business Combinations” of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport) for further discussion regarding the acquisition.\nAcquisition of Repustate, Inc.\nOn January 19, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Repustate, Inc. for a total purchase consideration of $8.3 million,\nconsisting of approximately $6.8 million in cash paid at the closing time of the acquisition and a holdback of $1.5 million in cash to\nbe paid as purchase consideration after the one-year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, assuming no claims by the\nCompany against the holdback amount for post-closing purchase price adjustments or indemnification matters. The purchase\nprice holdback was paid in full in January 2024.\nThe fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions. The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\nThe Repustate acquisition has increased our power, breadth and automation of social listening, messaging, and customer\ncare capabilities with added sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). We have\nincluded the financial results of Repustate in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The\nimpact of Repustate’s financial results following the date of acquisition were not significant to Sprout’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial\n27\nstatements. Refer to Note 11 - “Business Combinations” of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport) for further discussion.\n(cid:0).

We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in expanding our sales force and\nmarketing efforts to acquire new customers. Currently, we have approximately 30,000 customers. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while our total number of customers have\ndecreased, our number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and $50,000 in ARR increased. In addition, as we\ncontinue to focus on expanding our enterprise customer base, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience longer\nand more expansive average sale cycles and increased pricing pressure, which may be exacerbated by the macroeconomic\nfactors described above. We expect these trends to continue as we remain focused on our most sophisticated customers.\nExpanding within our current customer base\nWe believe that there is a substantial and largely untapped opportunity for organic growth within our existing customer\nbase. Customers often begin by purchasing a small number of user subscriptions and then expand over time, increasing the\nnumber of users or social profiles, as well as purchasing additional product modules. Customers may then expand use-cases\nbetween various departments to drive collaboration across their organizations. Our sales and customer success efforts include\nencouraging organizations to expand use-cases to more fully realize the value from the broader adoption of our platform\nthroughout an organization. We will continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our brand, creating additional uses for our\nproducts and developing more products, features and functionality of existing products, which we believe are vital to achieving\nincreased adoption of our platform. We have a history of attracting new customers and we have increased our focus on expanding\ntheir use of our platform over time.\nSustaining product and technology innovation\nOur success is dependent on our ability to sustain product and technology innovation and maintain the competitive\nadvantage of our proprietary technology. We continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform by\nintroducing new products, features and functionality of existing products.\nInternational expansion\nWe see international expansion as a meaningful opportunity to grow our platform. Revenue generated from non-U.S.\ncustomers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was(cid:0)(cid:3)approximately 27% of our total revenue. We have teams in\nIreland, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, India, Australia, the Philippines and Poland to support our growth internationally.\nWe believe global demand for our platform and offerings will continue to increase as awareness of our platform in international\nmarkets grows. We plan to continue adding to our local sales, customer support and customer success teams in select\ninternational markets over time.\n(cid:0).

Consistent with our communications in previous quarters, we no\nlonger believe that ARR and total number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s business due to our\nevolving customer mix and we will no longer publicly disclose these metrics.\n28\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR\nWe define customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than\n$10,000 in ARR as of a period end.\nWe view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our\ncustomers and attract larger organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our\ncurrent customer base. Over time, larger customers have constituted a greater share of our revenue.\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR 9,119 8,111\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR\nWe define customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than\n$50,000 in ARR as of a period end.\nWe view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our\nlargest customers and attract more sophisticated organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including\nexpanding within our current customer base. Over time, our largest customers have constituted a greater share of our revenue.\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR 1,610 1,252\nWhile we no longer believe that ARR and total number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s\nbusiness, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over $10,000 in\nARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue\nrun-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a\nunique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single\nagreement or entity.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nSubscription\nWe generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our social media management platform under a software-as-a-\nservice model.

Our\ncustomers do not have the right to take possession of the online software solution. We also generate a small portion of our\nsubscription revenue from third-party resellers.\n29\nProfessional Services\nWe sell professional services consisting of, but not limited to, implementation fees, specialized training, one-time reporting\nservices and recurring periodic reporting services. Professional services revenue is recognized at the time these services are\nprovided to the customer.

Sales commissions and\nbonuses are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions are earned and recorded\nat contract commencement for both new customer contracts and expansion of contracts with existing customers. Sales\ncommissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined\nto be five years.

We use the below non-GAAP\nfinancial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We\nbelieve that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency\nand comparability with past financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, operating\nresults or future outlook.\nHowever, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an\nanalytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with\nGAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently\nor may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as tools for comparison.

Historically, we have generated losses from operations as\nevidenced by our accumulated deficit and in previous years, we had negative cash flows from operations. However, for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated positive cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to incur\noperating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow the business. We may experience greater than anticipated\noperating losses in the short- and long-term due to macroeconomic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control, such\nas high inflation rates and a potential recession. The impact of these factors on our customers and our operations going forward\nremains uncertain, and we continue to proactively monitor our liquidity position.\nPrior to our IPO in December 2019, we financed our operations primarily through private issuance of equity securities and\nline of credit borrowings. In our IPO, we received net proceeds of $134.3 million\n46\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $10.5 million and offering expenses of $5.2 million. We subsequently\nreceived an additional $10.0 million of net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions in January 2020 as\na result of the over-allotment option exercise by the underwriters of our IPO. In August 2020, we received $42.1 million of net\nproceeds from our equity follow-on offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. As described below, in\nAugust 2023, we borrowed $75 million under the Facility in connection with the Tagger acquisition. Our principal uses of cash in\nrecent periods have been to fund operations, pay for acquisitions, invest in marketable securities, pay down our Facility, and\ninvest in capital expenditures.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least\nthe next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a\ncombination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash and investment balances and potential future equity or debt\ntransactions. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, subscription\nrenewal activity, billing frequency, the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our customers and our operations, the timing and\nextent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the\nintroduction of new and enhanced product offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our product. We have in the past,\nand may in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies,\nincluding intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional\nfinancing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to\nraise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nCredit Agreement\nOn August 1, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, the banks\nand other financial institutions or entities party thereto as lenders and MUFG Bank, LTD. as administrative agent and collateral\nagent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), maturing on August\n1, 2028. Borrowings under the Facility may be used to finance acquisitions and other investments permitted under the terms of\nthe Credit Agreement, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nBorrowings under the Facility may be designated as SOFR Loans or ABR Loans (each as defined in the Credit\nAgreement), subject to certain terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement, and bear interest at a rate of either (i) SOFR\n(subject to a 1.0% floor), plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25% based on the Company’s liquidity or (ii) ABR\n(subject to a 2.0% floor) plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% based on the Company’s liquidity. The Facility also includes\na quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Facility of 0.30% or 0.35% based on the Company’s liquidity.\nThe Credit Agreement includes customary conditions to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants, and\ncustomary events of default. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants as to (i) minimum liquidity, requiring\nthe maintenance, at all times and measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, of cash and cash equivalents of not less than the\ngreater of (x) $30 million and (y) 30% of the total revolving commitments, and (ii) minimum recurring revenue growth, requiring\nrecurring revenue growth for the trailing four fiscal quarter period, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, of not less than\n115% of the actual recurring revenue for the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOn August 1, 2023, we borrowed $75 million under the Credit Agreement in connection with the Tagger acquisition. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $30 million remains outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Our primary uses of\ncash from operating activities are for personnel costs across the sales and marketing and research and development departments\nand hosting costs. In previous years, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. However, for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated positive cash flows from operating activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.2 million, which\nresulted from a net loss of $47.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $83.6 million and net cash outflow of $13.9 million from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $61.9 million of stock-based compensation\nexpense, $11.6 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which were primarily commissions, $7.5 million of\ndepreciation and intangible asset amortization expense and $1.4 million of amortization of right-of-use, or ROU, operating lease\nassets. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $21.1 million increase in\ndeferred commissions due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the business, a $4.7 million increase in prepaid\nexpenses and other assets, a $2.9 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts payable\nand accrued expenses. These outflows were primarily offset by a $8.8 million increase in deferred revenue and a $7.7 million\ndecrease in accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $9.1 million, which\nresulted from a net loss of $46.4 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $71.2 million and net cash outflow of $15.8 million from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of $49.0 million of stock-based compensation\nexpense, $19.1 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which were primarily commissions, $1.1 million of\namortization of right-of-use, or ROU, operating lease assets, and $4.2 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization\nexpense. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $26.0 million increase\nin deferred commissions due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the business, a $3.5 million increase in prepaid\nexpenses and other assets, a $2.6 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, and a $7.7 million increase in accounts\nreceivable. These outflows were primarily offset by a $23.9 million increase in deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $36.7 million, which was\nprimarily due to $40.2 million in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities and $0.1 million consideration received\nrelated to a purchase price adjustment from the Tagger acquisition, partially offset by $2.1 million in purchases of computer\nequipment and hardware and the $1.5 million payout of the Repustate acquisition purchase price holdback.\n48\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $118.8 million, which was\nprimarily due to $145.8 million paid for the acquisitions of Tagger and Repustate and $63.1 million in purchases of marketable\nsecurities, partially offset by $91.5 million in proceeds from the maturities and sale of marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $25.7 million, primarily driven by\n$25.0 million in repayments of the Facility and $2.0 million in payments related to employee withholding taxes as a result of the\nnet settlement of stock-based awards, partially offset by $1.2 million in proceeds from purchases under our employee stock\npurchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $73.8 million, primarily\ndriven by $75.0 million in borrowings under the Facility and $1.4 million in proceeds from purchases under our employee stock\npurchase plan, partially offset by $1.8 million in payments related to employee withholding taxes as a result of the net settlement\nof stock-based awards and $0.8 million in issuance costs related to the Facility.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W (cid:0)X (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)J (cid:0)D (cid:0)W (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have non-cancellable contractual obligations related primarily to operating leases and\nminimum guaranteed purchase commitments for data and services.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 - “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024.

We also had marketable securities of $8.6 million which were invested in\ninvestment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. agency securities. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk with respect to the interest income generated. Additionally, certain of these cash investments are maintained at balances\nbeyond Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, coverage limits or are not insured by the FDIC. Accordingly, there may\nbe a risk that we will not recover the full principal of our cash investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been\nsignificant. Because these accounts are highly liquid, we do not have material exposure to market risk. Our cash is held for\nworking capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $30 million in secured indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The\nrevolving line of credit bears interest at a rate of either (i) SOFR (subject to a 1.0% floor), plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from\n2.75% to 3.25% based on the Company’s liquidity or (ii) ABR (subject to a 2.0% floor) plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%\nbased on the Company’s liquidity. Refer to Note 5 - “Revolving Line of Credit” of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I,\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report).\nWe have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.

However, we have some foreign currency risk related to a small amount of sales\ndenominated in Canadian dollars. Sales denominated in Canadian dollars reflect the prevailing U.S. dollar exchange rate on the\ndate of invoice for such sales. Decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar may negatively affect\nrevenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease\nin the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollars would have a material effect on operating results.\nWe have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date.

          "content": "SPROUT SOCIAL, INC.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\n(Effective as of July 28, 2021)\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sprout Social, Inc. (the “Company”) has\nadopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) to assist the Board\nin the exercise of its responsibilities and to serve the interests of the Company and its\nstockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall primarily be\nresponsible for recommending any changes to the Guidelines. These Guidelines should be\ninterpreted in the context of all applicable laws and the Company’s amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. These\nGuidelines acknowledge the leadership exercised by the Board’s standing committees and their\nchairs and are intended to serve as a flexible framework within which the Board may conduct its\nbusiness and not as a set of legally binding obligations. The Guidelines are subject to\nmodification from time to time by the Board as the Board may deem appropriate and in the best\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders or as required by applicable laws and regulations.\nI. THE BOARD\nA. Independence of the Board\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC\n(“Nasdaq”) rules, the Board will be comprised of a majority of directors who qualify as\nindependent directors (the “Independent Directors”) as required under Nasdaq rules. To\ndetermine independence, the Board will consider the definition of independence in the applicable\nNasdaq rules, and other factors that will contribute to effective oversight and decision-making.\nAt times required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or\nNasdaq and based on information provided by Board and advice of counsel, the Board or its\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make affirmative determinations of\ndirector independence.\nB. Separate Sessions of Independent Directors\nThe Independent Directors will meet in executive session without non-Independent\nDirectors or management present on a regularly scheduled basis, but no less than twice per year.\nC. Lead Independent Director\nFrom time to time, in the event that the Company does not have an independent\nChairman of the Board, the Board may designate a lead independent director. In the event that a\nlead independent director is designated, their duties would include: assisting the Chairman of the\nBoard and Board in assuring compliance with and implementation of the Company’s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, coordinating the agenda for and moderating sessions of the Board’s\nnon-management directors, acting as principal liaison between the non-management directors\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\nand the Chairman of the Board on sensitive issues and performing such other functions as the\nBoard may delegate.\nD. Director Qualification Standards and Additional Selection Criteria\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in recommending director\ncandidates, and the Board, in nominating director candidates, will evaluate candidates in\naccordance with the qualification standards set forth in Attachment A to these Guidelines. In\naddition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may also\nconsider the additional selection criteria listed in Attachment A.\nE. Director Orientation and Continuing Education\nManagement will provide an orientation process for new directors, including background\nmaterial on the Company and its business. As appropriate, management will provide\nopportunities for additional educational sessions for directors on matters relevant to the\nCompany and its business.\nF. Service on Other Boards\nThe Board recognizes that its members benefit from service on the boards of other\ncompanies and it encourages such service. The Board also believes, however, that it is critical\nthat directors have the opportunity to dedicate sufficient time to their service on the Company’s\nBoard. To that end, a director may not serve on the boards of more than four other public\ncompanies, provided that, any director who also serves as the chief executive officer of a public\ncompany or in an equivalent position should not serve on more than two public company boards\nin addition to the Company’s Board. Prior to accepting any position on the board of directors of\nany organization, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, current directors should notify the\nChairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board shall review the proposed board membership\nto ensure compliance with applicable laws and policies.\nService on other boards and/or committees should be consistent with the Company’s\nconflict of interest policies.\nG. Directors Who Resign or Materially Change Their Current Positions With Their\nOwn Company or Become Aware of Circumstances that May Adversely Reflect\nupon the Director or the Company\nWhen a director, including any director who is currently an officer or employee of the\nCompany, resigns or materially changes their position with their employer or becomes aware of\ncircumstances that may adversely reflect upon the director or the Company, such director should\nnotify the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of such circumstances. The\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the circumstances, and may in\ncertain cases recommend that the Board request that the director submit their resignation from\nthe Board if, for example, continuing service on the Board by the individual is not consistent\nwith the criteria deemed necessary for continuing service on the Board.\n2\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\nH. Mandatory Retirement\nDirectors will not be nominated for election or re-election to the Board after their 72nd\nbirthday. However, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee, the Board may nominate director candidates who have reached their 72nd birthday, if\nit determines that doing so is in the best interest of the Company.\nI. Director Responsibilities\nThe business and affairs of the Company will be managed by or under the direction of the\nBoard, including through one or more of its committees. Each director is expected to spend the\ntime and effort necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. These include:\n• exercising their business judgment in good faith;\n• acting in what they reasonably believe to be the best interest of all stockholders;\n• becoming and remaining well-informed about the Company’s business and\noperations and general business and economic trends affecting the Company; and\n• ensuring that the business of the Company is conducted so as to further the long-\nterm interests of its stockholders.\nJ. Compensation\nThe Board believes that director compensation should fairly pay directors for work\nrequired in a business of the Company’s size and scope, and that compensation should align\ndirectors’ interests with the long-term interests of stockholders. The Compensation Committee\nwill review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the cash and equity\ncompensation of directors. The Company’s executive officers do not receive additional\ncompensation for their service as directors.\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the applicable Nasdaq rules, members of the Audit\nCommittee and Compensation Committee may not directly or indirectly receive any\ncompensation from the Company other than their directors’ compensation, including any\ncompensation for service on committees of the Board and the receipt of equity incentive awards.\nK. Stock Ownership\nThe Company encourages directors to own shares of the Company’s stock. However, the\nnumber of shares of the Company’s stock owned by any director is a personal decision and, at\nthis time, the Board has chosen not to adopt a policy requiring ownership by directors of a\nminimum number of shares.\n3\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\nL. Board Access to Senior Management\nThe Board will have complete access to Company management in order to ensure that\ndirectors can ask any questions and receive all information necessary to perform their duties.\nDirectors should exercise judgment to ensure that their contact with management does not\ndistract managers from their jobs or disturb the business operations of the Company. Any\nmeetings or contacts that a director wishes to initiate may be arranged through the Chief\nExecutive Officer or the Chairman of the Board, or if neither is available or neither is\nappropriate, directly by the director. To the extent appropriate, such contact, if in writing, should\nbe copied to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nM. Board Access to Independent Advisors\nThe Board committees may hire independent advisors as set forth in their applicable\ncharters. The Board as a whole shall have access to any independent advisor retained by the\nCompany, and the Board may hire any independent advisor it considers necessary to discharge\nits responsibilities.\nN. Self-Evaluation\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will oversee a periodic\nassessment of the Board and its committees.\nO. Stockholder Communications with the Board\nStockholders of the Company wishing to communicate with the Board or an individual\ndirector may send a written communication to the Secretary at Sprout Social, Inc., 131 South\nDearborn Street, Suite 700, Chicago, Illinois 60603. The Secretary, in consultation with\nappropriate members of the Board, as necessary, will review all incoming communications and,\nif appropriate, such communications will be forwarded to the appropriate member or members of\nthe Board, or if none is specified, to the Chairperson of the Board.\nII. BOARD MEETINGS\nA. Frequency of Meetings\nThe Board will meet at least four (4) times annually. In addition, special meetings may\nbe called from time to time as determined by the needs of the business. It is the responsibility of\nthe directors to attend meetings.\n4\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\nB. Director Attendance\nA director is expected to spend the time and effort necessary to properly discharge their\nresponsibilities. Accordingly, a director is expected to regularly prepare for and attend meetings\nof the Board and all committees on which the director sits (including separate meetings of the\nIndependent Directors), with the understanding that, on occasion, a director may be unable to\nattend a meeting. A director who is unable to attend a meeting of the Board or a committee of\nthe Board is expected to notify the Chairman of the Board or the Chair of the appropriate\ncommittee in advance of such meeting, and, whenever possible, participate in such meeting via\nteleconference in the case of an in-person meeting.\nC. Attendance of Non-Directors\nThe Board encourages the Chairman of the Board or of any committee to invite Company\nmanagement and outside advisors or consultants from time to time to participate in Board and/or\ncommittee meetings to (i) provide insight into items being discussed by the Board which involve\nthe manager, advisor or consultant, (ii) make presentations to the Board on matters which\ninvolve the manager, advisor or consultant and (iii) bring managers with high potential into\ncontact with the Board. Attendance of non-directors at Board meetings is at the discretion of the\nBoard. For so long as the Sixth Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement, as amended,\nsupplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, is in effect, these Guidelines will be\ninterpreted to be consistent with such agreement.\nD. Advance Receipt of Meeting Materials\nInformation regarding the topics to be considered at a meeting is essential to the Board’s\nunderstanding of the business and the preparation of the directors for a productive meeting. To\nthe extent feasible, the meeting agenda and any written materials relating to each Board meeting\nwill be distributed to the directors sufficiently in advance of each meeting to allow for\nmeaningful review of such agenda and materials by the directors. Directors are expected to have\nreviewed and be prepared to discuss all materials distributed in advance of any meeting.\nIII. COMMITTEE MATTERS\nThe Board currently has three (3) standing committees: (i) the Audit Committee, (ii) the\nCompensation Committee and (iii) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each\ncommittee will perform its duties as assigned by the Board in compliance with the Company’s\nbylaws and the committee’s charter. It is the responsibility of the directors to attend the\nmeetings of the committees on which they serve.\nIV. SUCCESSION PLANNING\nThe Board (or a committee delegated by the Board) will (i) work on a periodic basis with\nthe Chief Executive Officer to evaluate the Company’s succession plans upon the Chief\nExecutive Officer’s retirement and in the event of an unexpected occurrence, and (ii) periodically\nreview the performance of the Chief Executive Officer.\n5\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\n* * * * *\n6\n2U5S2-9D4O72C5S8\\ 1v01 9165043.4\nSprout Social, Inc.\nAttachment A\nDirector Qualification Standards and Additional Selection Criteria\nDirector Qualification Standards:\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in recommending director\ncandidates for election to the Board, and the Board, in nominating director candidates, will\nconsider candidates who have a high level of personal and professional integrity, strong ethics\nand values and the ability to make mature business judgments.\nAdditional Selection Criteria:\nIn evaluating director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nand the Board may also consider the following criteria as well as any other factor that they deem\nto be relevant:\nA.

          "content": "SPROUT SOCIAL, INC. CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT\n(Effective as of July 26, 2023)\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Stock Market\n(“Nasdaq”) Listing Standards, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sprout Social, Inc. (the\n“Company”) has adopted this Code of Ethics and Conduct (the “Code”) to encourage:\n● Honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical handling of actual or\napparent conflicts of interest;\n● Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure;\n● Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n● Prompt internal reporting of any violations of law or the Code;\n● Accountability for adherence to the Code, including fair process by which to determine\nviolations;\n● Consistent enforcement of the Code, including clear and objective standards for\ncompliance;\n● Protection for persons reporting any such questionable behavior;\n● The protection of the Company’s legitimate business interests, including its assets and\ncorporate opportunities; and\n● Confidentiality of information entrusted to directors, officers, and employees by the\nCompany and its customers.\nAll directors, officers, and employees (each a “Covered Party” and, collectively, the\n“Covered Parties”) of the Company and all of its subsidiaries are expected to be familiar with the\nCode and to adhere to those principles and procedures set forth below. Covered Parties must\nconduct themselves accordingly, exhibiting the highest standard of business and professional\nintegrity, and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. This Code is intended to\nsupplement and support the Company’s other corporate governance and operational policies and\nprocedures related to proper conduct including, but not limited to, the Insider Trading Compliance\nPolicy (the “Insider Trading Policy”), the Global Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy (the “Anti-\nCorruption Policy”), the Policy for Complaints Regarding Accounting, Internal Accounting\nControls or Auditing Matters (the “Whistleblower Policy”) and the Related Party Transactions\nPolicy.\nFor purposes of this Code, the Company’s Board of Directors and officers (e.g. Senior\nLeadership Team) are referred to as the “Senior Company Officials.”\nI. Honest and Ethical Conduct\nThe Company expects every employee, officer and director to not only read and understand\nthe business practices and principles described in this Code, but to also apply good judgment and\nthe highest personal ethical standards in making business decisions, in accordance with the\nCompany's standards, values, and global leadership model. Covered Parties should consider not\nonly their own conduct, but also that of family members, significant others and other people in\ntheir household.\nII. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when the private interests of a Covered Party interfere, or\nappear to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a whole.\nFor example, a conflict of interest can arise when a Covered Party takes actions or has\npersonal interests that may make it difficult to perform their Company duties objectively and\neffectively. A conflict of interest may also arise when a Covered Party, or a member of their\nimmediate family,1 receives improper personal benefits as a result of their position at the\nCompany.\nConflicts of interest can also occur indirectly. For example, a conflict of interest may arise\nwhen a Covered Party is also an executive officer, a major shareholder, or has a material interest\nin a company or organization doing business with the Company.\nEach Covered Party has an obligation to conduct the Company’s business in an honest and\nethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between\npersonal and professional relationships. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably be\nexpected to involve, a conflict of interest between a Senior Company Official and the Company\nshould be disclosed promptly to the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit\nCommittee”), the Chairman of the Board and the Company’s General Counsel. Situations that\ninvolve, or may reasonably be expected to involve, a conflict of interest between any other\nemployee and the Company should be disclosed promptly to the Company’s Chief People Officer\nand General Counsel.\nThis Code does not attempt to describe all possible conflicts of interest that could develop.\nOther common conflicts from which Covered Parties must refrain are set out below:\n● Covered Parties may not engage in any conduct or activities inconsistent with the\nCompany's best interests or that disrupt or impair the Company's relationship with any\nperson or entity with which the Company has or proposes to enter into a business or\ncontractual relationship.\n● Covered Parties may not accept compensation, in any form, for services performed for\nthe Company from any source other than the Company.\n● No Covered Party may take up any management or other employment position with, or\nhave any material interest in, any firm or company in direct or indirect competition with\nthe Company.\nIII. Disclosures\nThe information in the Company’s public communications, including in all reports and\ndocuments filed with or submitted to the SEC, must be full, fair, accurate, timely, and\nunderstandable.\n1 Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K defines “immediate family member” as a person’s child, stepchild, parent,\nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-\nlaw, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the person’s household.\nTo ensure the Company meets this standard, all Covered Parties (to the extent they are\ninvolved in the Company’s disclosure process) must maintain familiarity with the disclosure\nrequirements, processes, and procedures applicable to the Company commensurate with their\nduties. Covered Parties are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting, or causing others\nto misrepresent or omit material facts about the Company to others, including the Company’s\nindependent auditors, governmental regulators, and self-regulatory organizations.\nIV. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. It is the\npersonal responsibility of each Covered Party to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed\nby these laws, rules, and regulations in performing their duties for the Company.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer or\nController (or persons performing similar functions) of the Company (together, the “Senior\nFinancial Officers”) are also required to promote compliance by all employees with the Code and\nto abide by Company standards, policies and procedures.\nCovered Parties located outside of the United States must comply with laws, regulations,\nrules and regulatory orders of the United States, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n(“FCPA”) and U.S. export control laws, in addition to applicable local laws.\nV. No Insider Trading\nTrading on inside information is a violation of federal securities law and is prohibited by\nthe Company’s Insider Trading Compliance Policy. Covered Parties in possession of material non-\npublic information about the Company or companies with whom we do business must abstain from\ntrading or advising others to trade in the respective company’s securities from when they obtain\nsuch inside information until adequate public disclosure of the information. Material information\nis information of such importance that it can be expected to affect the judgment of investors as to\nwhether or not to buy, sell, or hold the securities in question. To use non-public information for\npersonal financial benefit or to “tip” others, including family members, who might make an\ninvestment decision based on this information is unethical and illegal. Covered Parties who trade\nstock based on insider information may be subject to Company imposed sanctions, including\nremoval or dismissal for cause, and may be personally liable for damages totaling up to three times\nthe profit made or loss avoided by the respective Covered Party.\nVI. Corporate Opportunities\nVII. All Covered Parties owe a duty to the Company to advance the legitimate interests of the\nCompany when the opportunity to do so arises. Except as provided in the Company’s\nCertificate of Incorporation or bylaws, Covered Parties are prohibited from directly or\nindirectly (a) taking personally for themselves opportunities that are discovered through\nthe use of Company property, information or positions; (b) using Company property,\ninformation or positions for personal gain; or (c) competing with the Company for business\nopportunities; provided, however, if the Company's disinterested directors of the Board\ndetermine that the Company will not pursue an opportunity that relates to the Company's\nbusiness, a Covered Party may do so, after notifying the disinterested directors of the Board\nof intended actions in order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest.Confidentiality\nIn carrying out the Company’s business, Covered Parties may learn confidential or\nproprietary information about the Company, its customers, distributors, suppliers, or joint venture\npartners. Confidential or proprietary information includes all non-public information relating to\nthe Company, or other companies, including financial results or prospects, information provided\nby a third party, trade secrets, new product or marketing plans, research and development ideas,\npotential acquisitions or investments, or information of use to our competitors or harmful to our\ncustomers or us if disclosed.\nCovered Parties must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them,\nexcept when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Covered Parties must safeguard\nconfidential information by keeping it secure, limiting access to those who need to know to do\ntheir job, and avoiding discussing confidential information in public areas such as public\ntransportation, elevators, restaurants, and on mobile phones. This prohibition includes but is not\nlimited to, inquiries made by the press, analysts, investors, or others. Covered parties also may not\nuse such information for personal gain. These confidentiality obligations continue even after\nemployment or service with the Company ends and in no way diminish any additional\nconfidentiality obligations that may apply to Covered Parties through their employment\nagreements, separate confidentiality agreements with the Company, or otherwise at law.\nVIII. Fair Dealing\nEach Covered Party should deal fairly with the Company’s customers, service providers,\nsuppliers, competitors, and employees. No Covered Party should take unfair advantage of anyone\nthrough manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material\nfacts, or any unfair dealing practice. Inappropriate use of proprietary information, misusing trade\nsecret information obtained without the owner's consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or\npresent employees of other companies is also prohibited.\nIX. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll Covered Parties should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use.\nTheft, carelessness and waste directly impact the Company’s profitability. All Company assets\nshould be used only for legitimate business purposes. The obligation of employees to protect the\nCompany’s assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes\nintellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business\nand marketing plans, customer and vendor information, engineering ideas, designs, databases,\nroadmaps, records, salary information, and any unpublished financial data and reports.\nX. Waivers\nBefore an employee, or an immediate family member of any such employee, engages in\nany activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, they are strongly encouraged to obtain\na written waiver from the Chief People Officer or General Counsel.\nBefore a Senior Company Official, or an immediate family member of a Senior Company\nOfficial, engages in any activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code in provisions I\nthrough IX above, they must obtain a written waiver from the disinterested members of the Board.\nSuch waiver must then be disclosed to the Company’s shareholders, along with the reasons for\ngranting the waiver.\nXI. Accuracy of Business Records\nAll financial books, records, and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events,\nand conform both to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and to the Company's\nsystem of internal controls. No entry may be made that intentionally hides or disguises the true\nnature of any transaction. Covered Parties should therefore be as clear, concise, truthful, and\naccurate as possible when recording any information.\nXII. Corporate Loans or Guarantees\nFederal law prohibits the Company from making loans and guarantees of obligations to\ndirectors, executive officers, and members of their immediate families.\nXIII. No Improper Influence\nThe purpose of business gifts and entertainment in a commercial setting is to create\ngoodwill and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers. Covered\nParties must act in a fair and impartial manner in all business dealings. Gifts and entertainment\nshould further the business interests of the Company and not be construed as potentially\ninfluencing business judgment or creating an obligation.\nThe Anti-Corruption Policy sets forth key principles and procedures regarding anti-\ncorruption compliance and refers to practices that should be incorporated into all of the Company’s\nbusiness activities globally. Subject to the Anti-Corruption Policy, gifts must not be lavish or in\nexcess of the generally accepted business practices of one’s country and industry nor may gifts\never be used to improperly influence, or give the appearance of improperly influencing, any\nbusiness decision. Receiving gift cards with an aggregate value of more than $25 per person per\ntax year is not permitted. Gifting gift cards with an aggregate value of more than $25 per customer\nper tax year is not permitted. Gifts of cash \\are never permitted. Gift cards must not be gifted to\ngovernment officials. Requesting or soliciting personal gifts, favors, entertainment, or services is\nunacceptable. Covered Parties should contact the Company’s General Counsel to discuss if they\nare not certain that a gift is appropriate.\nThe FCPA prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign\ngovernments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business. It is strictly\nprohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country. In addition, the\npromise, offer, or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor, or\nother gratuity violating these rules would not only violate Company policy but could also be a\ncriminal offense. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar\nrules.\nXIV. Personal Investments\nCovered Parties may not own, either directly or indirectly, a substantial interest in any\nbusiness entity that does or seeks to do business with or is in competition with the Company\nwithout providing advance notice. Senior Company Official’s should provide advance notice to\nthe Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Board and the Company’s General Counsel. All other\nemployees should provide advance notice to the Company’s Chief People Officer and General\nCounsel. Investments in publicly traded securities of companies not amounting to more than one\npercent (1%) of that company's total outstanding shares are permitted without such advanced\napproval.\nXV. Antitrust Laws and Competition\nThe purpose of antitrust laws is to preserve fair and open competition and a free market\neconomy, which are goals that the Company fully supports. Covered Parties must not directly or\nindirectly enter into any formal or informal agreement with competitors that fixes or controls\nprices, divides or allocates markets, limits the production or sale of products, boycotts certain\nsuppliers or customers, eliminates competition or otherwise unreasonably restrains trade.\nXVI. Political Contributions\nCovered Parties may participate in the political process as individuals on their own time.\nHowever, Covered Parties must make every effort to ensure that they do not create the impression\nthat they speak or act on behalf of the Company with respect to political matters. Contributions by\ncompanies to politicians, candidates, political parties, political action committees, or other political\norganizations are highly regulated. For this reason, all political contributions by or on behalf of\nthe Company must be pre-approved by the General Counsel. A Covered Party may not receive any\nreimbursement from corporate funds for a personal political contribution.\nXVII. No Discrimination and Harassment\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer and will not tolerate illegal discrimination\nor harassment. The Company is committed to providing a workplace free of discrimination or\nharassment based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual\norientation, or gender identity), national origin, disability, genetic information, and any other basis\nprohibited by applicable law.\nHarassment can take many forms, including verbal or written statements, derogatory\ncomments, inappropriate jokes or language, bullying, physical conduct, or unwanted sexual\nadvances. Harassment can occur through a series of repetitive actions or from a single isolated\nevent.\nIf you believe you have been unlawfully harassed or discriminated should report such\nconcerns to your manager, your People Business Partner, any member of the Company’s\nmanagement, the Chief People Officer, the General Counsel or anonymously as detailed in this\nCode. If you are a manager and receive a complaint, you must promptly report it to a People\nBusiness Partner.\nAll reports will be treated respectfully, seriously, and confidentially to the greatest extent\npossible. The Company will promptly investigate and determine whether any corrective or other\naction is appropriate.\nXVIII. Environmental Protection\nThe Company is committed to managing and operating its assets in a manner that is\nprotective of human health and safety and the environment. It is our policy to comply with both\nthe letter and the spirit of the applicable health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations\nand to attempt to develop a cooperative attitude with government inspection and enforcement\nofficials. Covered Parties are encouraged to report conditions that they perceive to be unsafe,\nunhealthy or hazardous to the environment.\nXIX. Personal Conduct and Social Media Policy\nCovered Parties should take care when presenting themselves in public settings, as well as\nonline and in web-based forums or networking sites. Each Covered Party is encouraged to conduct\nthemself in a responsible, respectful, and honest manner at all times. The Company understands\nthat Covered Parties may wish to create and maintain a personal presence online using various\nforms of social media. However, in so doing Covered Parties should include a disclaimer that the\nviews expressed therein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Company. Covered Parties\nshould be aware that even after a posting is deleted, certain technology may still make that content\navailable to readers.\nCovered Parties are prohibited from using or disclosing confidential, proprietary, sensitive\nor trade secret information of the Company, its partners, vendors, consultants or other third parties\nwith which the Company does business. Harassment of other directors, officers or employees will\nalso not be tolerated.\nXX. Questions, Reporting, Accountability, and Enforcement\nThe Company promotes ethical behavior at all times and encourages Covered Parties to\ntalk to your manager, your People Business Partners and other appropriate personnel, including\nthe officers, the General Counsel, Chief People Officer, and the Board or the relevant committee\nthereof, when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. Covered Parties\nshould feel free to discuss any questions or concerns, including about the applicability of this Code,\nwith the Company’s General Counsel.\nCovered Parties should promptly report suspected violations of laws, rules, regulations, or\nthe Code or any other unethical behavior. Suspected violations involving Senior Company\nOfficials should be reported to the Company's Audit Committee, care of the General Counsel,\nwhile those involving all other employees should be reported to both the Company's Chief People\nOfficer and General Counsel..\nCovered Parties may also submit a report anonymously through the Company’s Fraud and\nWhistleblower Portal link on the Company’s intranet site or by calling the toll-free numbers listed\nbelow:\n● English-speaking USA and Canada: 833-782-7031\n● Spanish-speaking USA and Canada: 800-216-1288\n● French-speaking Canada: 855-725-0002\n● Spanish-speaking Mexico: 01-800-681-5340\n● All other countries: 800-603-2869 (must dial country access code first)\n●\nAdditional information about how to report concerns regarding the Company’s audit and\naccounting matters can be found in the Company’s Whistleblower Policy.\nThe Company must ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code..\nAfter receiving a report of an alleged violation, the Company’s General Counsel or Chief People\nOfficer, as applicable, will promptly take all appropriate actions necessary to investigate. If the\nreport of an alleged violation involves a Senior Company Official, the Audit Committee shall\ninvestigate and determine or shall designate appropriate persons to investigate and determine the\nlegitimacy of such reports. All Covered Parties are expected to cooperate in any internal\ninvestigation of misconduct.\nIf any investigation indicates that a violation of this Code is more probable than not, we\nwill take such action as we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. If we determine that\nan employee, or Senior Company Official is responsible for a Code violation, they will be subject\nto disciplinary action up to, and including, termination and, in appropriate cases, civil action or\nreferral for criminal prosecution.\nTo encourage employees to report any and all violations, the Company will not tolerate\nretaliation for reports made in good faith. Retaliation or retribution against any Covered Party for\na report made in good faith of any suspected violation of laws, rules, regulations, or this Code is\ncause for appropriate disciplinary action.\nXXI. Amendments\nAny changes to this Code may only be made by approval by the Board. All changes must\nbe promptly disclosed as required by law or regulation.\nXXII. No Rights Created\nThis Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies, and procedures that\ngovern the Company’s Covered Parties in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not intended\nto and does not create any rights for any employee, customer, client, visitor, supplier, competitor,\nshareholder, or any other person or entity. The Company believes that the Code is robust and\ncovers most conceivable situations."
