(NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today announced data from preclinical studies identifying ASXL1 mutation as key predictor of SLS009, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, response in solid cancers.\n\nBased on elucidated biology of ASXL1 mutations, results from SELLAS’ clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and reports of common occurrence of ASXL1 mutations in some solid cancers, the Company performed experiments and analyses to explore the following:\n\n  * The frequency of ASXL1 mutations in certain solid cancers, including colorectal carcinomas (CRC) with high level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\n  * Whether ASXL1 mutations in solid cancers may predict as high SLS009 efficacy as the efficacy exhibited in AML where ASXL1 and similar mutations demonstrated high response rates in SELLAS’ clinical trials\n\n\n\nSELLAS performed experiments in patient derived cell lines (PDCs) exposing them to SLS009 at various concentrations and determining the inhibitory concentration (IC50) for each cell line. All cell lines were analyzed for presence of ASXL1 mutations and other genetic markers. High efficacy was prespecified as IC50 < 100 nM, significantly lower than the standard threshold definition for an effective compound (IC50 < 1,000 nM). This threshold was chosen based on the observed long-lasting concentrations of SLS009 observed in patients, which were ~400 nM.\n\nNegative controls consisted of untreated cell lines, while active negative control varying concentrations of revumenib (drug used in hematologic malignancies). Positive controls involved cell lines treated with staurosporine at different concentrations (staurosporine is a standard control compound for kinase inhibitors due to its high broad-spectrum potency in inhibiting most protein kinases at sub-micromolar concentrations).\n\nThe results were as follows:\n\n  * In CRC MSI-H, ASXL1 mutations were observed in 7/12 (58%) of PDCs, aligning with predicted frequency of ~55%\n  * In NSCLC, ASXL1 mutations occurred in 2/6 (33%) studied cell lines, higher than predicted 2.6%\n  * Overall, in 18 studied solid cancer cell lines, ASXL1 mutations were recorded in 9 cell lines and no ASXL1 mutations were recorded in 9 cell lines which were designated as control\n  * In ASXL1 mutated cell lines, high SLS009 efficacy (IC50 <100 nM) was observed in 6/9 (67%) solid cancer cell lines and in non-ASXL1 mutated cancer high SLS009 efficacy was observed in 0/9 (0%) of studied solid cancer cell lines \n    * In CRC MSI-H, high efficacy (IC50 <100 nM) was observed in 4/7 (57%) of ASXL1 mutated cell lines and in 0/5 (0%) of non-ASXL1 mutated cell lines\n    * In NSCLC, high efficacy (IC50 <100 nM) was observed in 2/2 (100%) of ASXL1 mutated cell lines and in 0/4 (0%) of non-ASXL1 mutated cell lines\n  * No activity was observed in any of the studied cell lines with revumenib (negative control) at any concentration\n  * Staurosporine activity was confirmed, but interestingly and importantly, SLS009 outperformed positive control staurosporine in 5/9 cell lines\n\n\n\n“These findings are incredibly encouraging and validate our approach to developing a targeted solid tumor therapy. We are excited that our hypotheses were confirmed, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to advance the identification of ASXL1 mutations as a potential biomarker for a drug response in solid cancers,” said Dr. Dragan Cicic, Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer at SELLAS. “Our experiments show that SLS009 demonstrates high efficacy with low IC50 values and with 67% of mutated cell lines responding positively, compared to no response in non-mutated cell lines. In addition, SLS009 outperformed positive control in 5 out of 9 cell lines, establishing itself as a highly effective therapeutic candidate. These critical findings are the missing pieces, complementing our existing safety and efficacy data in AML, and positions us strongly with SLS009 in solid cancers.”\n\nSELLAS has filed for provisional patent protection for the use of ASXL1 mutations as predictive diagnostic for selection of cancer patients likely to benefit based on clinical data and biology.\n\n**About SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.**\n\nSELLAS is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications. SELLAS’ lead product candidate, GPS, is licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and targets the WT1 protein, which is present in an array of tumor types.

(NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We continue to make considerable progress across our pipeline, and we are particularly excited to announce the updated SLS009 Phase 2a data at ASH in December and to provide topline data from cohorts four and five in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) this quarter,” said Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD h.c., President and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. “We are extremely grateful to the patients and their families, principal investigators and study teams, SELLAS employees, and all of those who have contributed to our Phase 3 REGAL study of galinpepimut-S (GPS). We are excited to be on the cusp of potentially adding a novel immunotherapy to physicians’ arsenals in their mission to prolong patients’ lives. We are looking forward to the significant milestones on the horizon, with interim analysis from our Phase 3 REGAL study of GPS in AML anticipated in the coming weeks.”\n\n**Pipeline Highlights****Galinpepimut-S (GPS): Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) targeting immunotherapeutic**\n\n**Phase 3 REGAL study in AML:** In June, the IDMC conducted a prespecified risk-benefit assessment of unblinded data from the study and recommended that the trial continue without modifications. Based on a detailed analysis of all unblinded data, the IDMC projected that the interim analysis (60 events) will occur in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Granted FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD):** The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) to GPS for the treatment of pediatric AML. GPS has already demonstrated promise in clinical settings for AML, which could extend to pediatric patients.\n\n**SLS009: highly selective and specific CDK9 inhibitor**\n\n**ASH Poster Presentation Upcoming December 8, 2024:** Phase 2a Study of SLS009, a Highly Selective CDK9 Inhibitor, In Combination with Azacitidine and Venetoclax for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Prior Venetoclax Treatment.\n\nThe study enrolled 30 patients across three dosing levels (DLs) of SLS009:45 mg IV QW, DL2: 60 mg IV QW, and DL3: 30 mg IV BIW. SLS009 was well-tolerated across the DLs tested with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. Among 29 evaluable pts, 16 (55%) had ≥50% reduction in bone marrow (BM) blasts compared to baseline (DL1: 60%; DL2: 33%; DL3: 80%). Nine (31%) patients achieved an overall response (i.e., CR+CRi+MLFS), including 5 (17%) who achieved CR/CRi. The response rates per dose level were 10% in DL1, 33% in DL2, and 50% in DL3. All 9 responders had AML- Myelodysplasia Related (AML-MR) (9/23 of AMLMR pts responded) and 8/15 pts (53%) with somatic MR mutations responded. Among those with ASXL1 mutations, 5/9 (56%) achieved an overall response. 2/9 (22%) with TP53 mutations achieved a response including one patient with concomitant TP53 and ASXL1 mutation who had an ongoing response at data cut-off. Fifteen patients were still alive at the time of the data cutoff and the median OS for the trial has not been reached.\n\n**Additional Phase 2 Cohorts in Venetoclax Combinations in r/r AML Continue Enrollment:** Development of SLS009 continued with the ongoing enrollment of two additional cohorts: AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML MRC) with ASXL1 mutations and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes other than ASXL1 mutations. These cohorts are also open for enrollment of certain pediatric patients. Additional topline data updates are expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**National Institute of Health PIVOT program in Pediatric Tumors:** The program in multiple pediatric cancer indications continuesin collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Initial safety and efficacy data are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Recently Granted Regulatory Designations for SLS009:** The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) to SLS009 for the treatment of pediatric ALL in June 2024 and the FDA granted RPDD to SLS009 for the treatment of pediatric AML in July 2024. Also, the EMA granted Orphan Drug Designation for SLS009 in AML and in PTCL in June 2024 and July 2024, respectively. The FDA previously granted SLS009 Orphan Drug Designations in AML and PTCL and Fast Track designations for r/r AML and r/r PTCL.\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2024:**\n\n**R &D Expenses**: Research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $4.4 million, compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in global clinical supply purchases, consultants, personnel-related expenses due to changes in headcount, and clinical trial expenses.\n\n**G &A Expenses**: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.0 million, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to personnel-related expenses due to changes in headcount and insurance premiums.\n\n**Net Loss** : The net loss was $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.10, as compared to a net loss of $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.33. The net loss was $24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.42, as compared to a net loss of $29.2 million for the same period in 2023, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $1.09.\n\n**Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $21 million.\n\n**About SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.**\n\nSELLAS is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications.

(NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today announced that data from its Phase 2a trial of SLS009, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML) will be presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition, which is being held on December 7 –10, 2024, in San Diego, California.\n\n“We are excited to have SLS009 featured at the 2024 ASH meeting and are pleased with the very promising safety and efficacy results from the Phase 2a trial in r/r AML,” said Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD h.c., President and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. “Treatment with SLS009 in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax was well tolerated and led to a 50% response rate in the selected optimal dose. Clinical activity was even higher in patients with AML-myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) and in particular those with ASXL1 mutations, suggesting that this subset of patients may exhibit preferential sensitivity to SLS009. These findings contribute to the growing evidence supporting the potential of SLS009 to address unmet needs in difficult-to-treat populations, and future development efforts will focus on further exploring its impact in patients with AML-MRC.”\n\n**Poster presentation details:**\n\n**Title:**|  Phase 2a Study of SLS009, a Highly Selective CDK9 Inhibitor, In Combination with Azacitidine and Venetoclax for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Prior Venetoclax Treatment  \n---|---  \n**Session Date and Time:**|  Sunday, December 8, 2024, 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM PST  \n**Session Title:**|  Acute Myeloid Leukemias: Investigational Drug and Cellular Therapies: Poster II  \n**Location:**|  San Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H  \n**Lead Author:**|  Joshua F. Zeidner, MD, University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC  \n**Abstract Number:**|  2877  \n  \nThe study enrolled 30 patients across three dosing levels (DLs) of SLS009:45 mg IV QW, DL2: 60 mg IV QW, and DL3: 30 mg IV BIW. SLS009 was well-tolerated across the DLs tested with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. Among 29 evaluable pts, 16 (55%) had ≥50% reduction in bone marrow (BM) blasts compared to baseline (DL1: 60%; DL2: 33%; DL3: 80%). Nine (31%) patients achieved an overall response (i.e., CR+CRi+MLFS), including 5 (17%) who achieved CR/CRi. The response rates per dose level were 10% in DL1, 33% in DL2, and 50% in DL3. All 9 responders had AML- Myelodysplasia Related (AML-MR) (9/23 of AMLMR pts responded) and 8/15 pts (53%) with somatic MR mutations responded. Among those with ASXL1 mutations, 5/9 (56%) achieved an overall response. 2/9 (22%) with TP53 mutations achieved a response including one patient with concomitant TP53 and ASXL1 mutation who had an ongoing response at data cut-off. Fifteen patients were still alive at the time of the data cutoff and the median OS for the trial has not been reached.\n\nFor more information on the study, visit [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1GNLX56zlbfd0RjSk3bao48-VMMj3t0tawMvJBfhT8lI_hL2MrVa-UD_nM_emxEo8W_SEj7Z9cl40keCV25avWa9SunndLAOx_Zto1lws9U=) identifier [NCT04588922](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hZaqf1SSf1K-M_t3ueWt4_w2j5Wt7mn98VCoJFnDpdohonkCAeqqdfZAkj0YNgzi2wV1iGhMEb_OBZaBePN7tJiReg1P26Sk5QPJMxMxSFDEMyM91pdwgxddIxOOY2pwChFZJAxffdsZF9ZdnJkd4rtCkNvK_oXzwtvN8sVmMH9WMPOPThpyzrmGxFFEs7j0_M5MVNMTNcJPgX7sQ90zs9al2OwqbhcVF0r4klVl8SrfQGFQL1Dg78dQ7Ixio5O6UoHgOvGDLsbV9Eiuh-hAv8DvhaOFAN0F4976YMH2QkN4U4MkgTmSTLDEsbY8ID1D5BrPzsJIHpYdXEofzqxQo5G2iakAgVpDjwTwPGob5ps=).\n\nThe accepted abstract is published and available on the ASH website [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TNYqjS1JKaOjhaCJavaUfDH6MQBnYcAmH-h-9ksUW4koIHtMO7Uv2zV1FjzDf41NfkD94CITJhMCnulZihhm6xmUuwruSSunOcsfNmLIAJBQBy72RYsvWyQH-rlhZdfm).\n\n**About SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.**\n\nSELLAS is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications. SELLAS’ lead product candidate, GPS, is licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and targets the WT1 protein, which is present in an array of tumor types. GPS has the potential as a monotherapy and combination with other therapies to address a broad spectrum of hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications. The Company is also developing SLS009 (formerly GFH009) - potentially the first and best-in-class differentiated small molecule CDK9 inhibitor with reduced toxicity and increased potency compared to other CDK9 inhibitors. Data suggests that SLS009 demonstrated a high response rate in AML patients with unfavorable prognostic factors including ASXL1 mutation, commonly associated with poor prognosis in various myeloid diseases.
