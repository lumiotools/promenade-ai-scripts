The Securities and Futures Commission takes no responsibility for the contents of this announcement,\nmakes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness, and expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any loss howsoever\narising from or in reliance upon the whole or any part of the contents of this announcement.\n( Incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)\nStock Codes: 388 (HKD counter) and 80388 (RMB counter)\n(Financial figures in this announcement are expressed in Hong Kong dollar (HKD) unless otherwise stated)\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nFOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024\n1\nHIGHLIGHTS\nBonnie Y Chan, Chief Executive Officer said:\n“HKEX had a strong third quarter, achieving its second-best ever nine-month revenue and profit. The vibrancy and\ndiversity of Hong Kong’s markets were on full display in late September, as investor sentiment turned more favourable\nfollowing the announcement of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, as well as the monetary easing policies\nadopted by major central banks. This drove strong volumes in all our markets, with multiple daily records achieved across\nthe Cash, Derivatives, ETP and Northbound and Southbound Stock Connect markets. Furthermore, the Commodities\nmarket extended its robust performance in the third quarter, reporting a 25 per cent year-on-year gain in LME chargeable\naverage daily volumes during the nine-month period, contributing to the strength in the Group’s results during this period.\nThe recent listing on the Exchange of Asia’s largest and the world’s second-biggest IPO this year, along with the strength\nof follow-on offering volumes, underscore the depth and attractiveness of our markets, whilst a healthy listing pipeline\nreinforces our position as the region’s IPO fundraising centre of choice. Moreover, Alibaba’s conversion to a dual primary\nlisting, and its subsequent inclusion in Stock Connect, highlights how such a structure can help companies effectively tap\ninto Mainland China’s capital pool and enhance liquidity.\nAs part of our strategic efforts, HKEX successfully implemented Severe Weather Trading arrangements in the Securities\nand Derivatives Markets. This reinforces Hong Kong’s status as the best-in-class international trading and risk\nmanagement hub, aligning us with global standards. Additionally, we enhanced the Self-Match Prevention service in the\nDerivatives Market, and introduced Weekly Hang Seng TECH Index Options.\nLooking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to further enhancing the vibrancy, resilience, and competitiveness\nof our markets. By continuously expanding our product offerings, forging international partnerships, and investing in our\ninfrastructure, we are well positioned to navigate the evolving macro-environment and propel sustained growth. We look\nforward to working closely in partnership with our stakeholders in Hong Kong, and around the world, to ensure that our\nmarkets remain fit for purpose for the next generation of investors.”\nStrategic Highlights\n Record nine-month high for ADT of Northbound Trading of Stock Connect\n Record nine-month high for ADV of derivatives contracts traded\n Record nine-month high for ADT of Northbound Bond Connect\n Record nine-month high for ADT of ETPs\n Record nine-month high for OTC Clear’s clearing volume\n Turnover of Cash Market, Stock Connect and Derivatives Market volumes achieved multiple daily record highs in\nSeptember 2024\n Implementation of Severe Weather Trading arrangements in the Securities and Derivatives Markets effective 23\nSeptember 2024\n Weekly Hang Seng TECH Index Options launched\n OTC Clear started accepting new trades for clearing under Swap Connect on Special Working Days\n Midea Group Co., Ltd. listed on the Stock Exchange, becoming the largest IPO in Asia and the second largest IPO\nglobally in YTD Q3 2024\n Alibaba Group Holding Limited converted to Dual Primary Listing, and was subsequently included in Stock Connect\n IPO pipeline remained healthy with 96 active applications as at 30 September 2024\n Introduction of enhanced Self-Match Prevention service in Derivatives Market\n The LME published its White Paper on Enhancing Liquidity, which outlined a package of measures designed to boost\ntransparency and increase price competition\n The LME announced its proposal to mandate emissions reporting for LME-listed aluminium brands, in line with the\nEuropean Union (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) methodology\n In October 2024, the UK Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the claimant against the LME and LME Clear, in\nrelation to the nickel events in March 2022\n2\nComparison of Q3 2024 with Q3 2023\nFinancial Highlights\n Q3 2024 revenue and other income reached a record third quarter high.\n Q3 2024 revenue and other income of $5,372 million was 6 per cent higher than Q3 2023:\n- Core business revenue was up 3 per cent against Q3 2023, attributable to increases in trading and clearing fees\nfrom higher volumes across the Cash, Derivatives and Commodities Markets, partly offset by lower net investment\nincome from Margin Funds.\n- Net investment income from Corporate Funds was $507 million (Q3 2023: $360 million), driven by the higher net\nfair value gains of the externally-managed investment funds (External Portfolio) (Q3 2024: gains of $156 million;\nQ3 2023: losses of $5 million).\n Operating expenses were up 5 per cent, attributable to higher staff and IT costs.\n EBITDA margin1 was 74 per cent in both periods.\n Profit attributable to shareholders was $3,145 million, 7 per cent higher than Q3 2023.\nKey Financials\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023\n$m $m Change\nRevenue and other income\nCore business revenue 4,852 4,696 3%\nDonation income of HKEX Foundation 13 28 (54%)\nNet investment income of Corporate Funds 507 360 41%\n5,372 5,084 6%\nOperating expenses 1,365 1,304 5%\nEBITDA (non-HKFRS measure)1 3,926 3,706 6%\nProfit attributable to shareholders 3,145 2,953 7%\nCapital expenditure 415 329 26%\nBasic earnings per share $2.49 $2.33 7%\nKey Market Statistics\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 Change\nADT of equity products traded on the Stock Exchange1 ($bn) 107.2 87.0 23%\nADT of DWs, CBBCs and warrants traded on the Stock Exchange ($bn) 11.6 11.4 2%\nADT traded on the Stock Exchange1,2 (Headline ADT) ($bn) 118.8 98.4 21%\nADT of Northbound Trading of Stock Connect1 (RMBbn) 110.3 106.1 4%\nADT of Southbound Trading of Stock Connect1 ($bn) 39.6 29.0 37%\nADV of derivatives contracts traded on the Futures Exchange (’000 contracts) 778 745 4%\nADV of stock options contracts traded on the Stock Exchange (’000 contracts) 705 591 19%\nChargeable ADV3 of metals contracts traded on the LME (’000 lots) 642 548 17%\nADT of Northbound Bond Connect (RMBbn) 43.4 43.6 0%\n1 Includes buy and sell trades under Stock Connect\n2 ADT of Southbound Trading is included within Headline ADT.\n3 Chargeable ADV excludes administrative trades (Admin Trades).\n1 For the purposes of this announcement, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expenses and other finance costs, taxation,\ndepreciation and amortisation.

Several new daily records were set in the Cash and\nDerivatives Markets in September, including the Cash Market trading turnover, Northbound and\nSouthbound Stock Connect trading turnover, and the Derivatives Market trading volume. The IPO\nmarket also recorded considerable growth, with the listing of Midea Group Co., Ltd. in Q3, being\nthe largest IPO in Asia and the second largest IPO globally in YTD Q3 2024.\nDriven by the positive market sentiment, Q3 2024 revenue and other income reached a record\nthird-quarter high of $5.4 billion, up 6 per cent compared with Q3 2023, reflecting higher trading\nand clearing fees from higher volumes across the Cash, Derivatives and Commodities Markets,\nand increased net fair value gains of the External Portfolio (Q3 2024: gains of $156 million; Q3\n2023: losses of $5 million), partly offset by lower net investment income from Margin Funds.\nOperating expenses were up 5 per cent against Q3 2023, attributable to higher staff and IT costs.\nAs a result, profit for Q3 2024 was 7 per cent higher than Q3 2023. Comparing Q3 results with the\nprevious quarter (which reached record second-quarter highs for both revenue and profit), revenue\nand other income was down 1 per cent, and profit was down marginally by $10 million, reflecting a\nmodest decrease in trading volumes across all markets.\nFor YTD Q3 2024, Headline ADT was 3 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The Group’s\nDerivatives Market and Commodities Market continued their growth momentum of 1H 2024 and\nperformed strongly, with ADV of derivatives contracts traded reaching a record nine-month high, up\n12 per cent compared with YTD Q3 2023, and chargeable ADV of metals contracts traded on the\nLME up 25 per cent against YTD Q3 2023.\n2 HKEX and its subsidiaries, which include The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK or the Stock Exchange), Hong Kong Futures\nExchange Limited (HKFE or the Futures Exchange), Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC), HKFE Clearing Corporation\nLimited (HKCC), The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited (SEOCH), OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTC Clear), The London Metal\nExchange (LME), LME Clear Limited (LME Clear), Qianhai Mercantile Exchange Co., Ltd. (QME), BayConnect Technology Company Limited\n(BayConnect) and other subsidiaries\n6\nRevenue and other income of $16.0 billion was 2 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The increase\nwas attributable to higher trading and clearing fees from the higher trading volumes across all\nmarkets and the LME fee increment effective from 1 January 2024, and higher net fair value gains\nof the External Portfolio (YTD Q3 2024: $389 million; YTD Q3 2023: $210 million), but partly offset\nby lower net investment income of the Margin Funds. Operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 6\nper cent against YTD Q3 2023, due to higher staff costs arising from increases in headcount and\npayroll adjustments, and an increase in IT costs due to new or upgraded systems and inflationary\nadjustments on contract renewals.

In addition, the\nLME issued its response to the feedback relating to the sustainability-related initiatives outlined in\nthe discussion paper.\nLME Week was held in the last week of September 2024, which started off with the annual flagship\nconference, the LME Metals Seminar, featuring informative discussion and debate on the\nopportunities and issues facing the metals industry. The event was attended by around 900 market\nparticipants.\nIn October 2024, the UK Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the claimant, confirming that the\naction taken by the LME in relation to the nickel events in March 2022 was lawful, rational and\nnecessary in the exceptional circumstances of 8 March 2022. The positive outcome of the Appeal\nwas welcomed by the Group, and the LME remains committed to the ongoing development of its\nmarkets and will continue to promote efficiency, access and transparency to ensure the long-term\nhealth and resilience of the metals community.\n16\nQME\nDuring YTD Q3 2024, QME continued to expand its market presence, especially in the soybean\nsector. In September 2024, QME successfully hosted a seminar, Unleashing the Brazil-China\nSoybean Trading Synergy, in collaboration with the Brazilian Stock and Futures Exchange and the\nShenzhen Qianhai Authority. Additionally, QME introduced a new settlement method for cross-\nborder trades (i.e., by letter of credit) during Q3 2024, offering clients a diverse range of settlement\nmethods and enhancing convenience for industry participants.\nData and Connectivity Segment\nAnalysis of Results\nBoth revenue and other income and EBITDA\nYTD Q3 2024 vs YTD Q3 2023 ($m)\nwere up 1 per cent compared with YTD Q3\n2023, mainly due to increase in hosting Revenue and other Operating expenses EBITDA\nservices fees. income -1% +1%\n+1%\n80% 79%\nHosting Services fees increased by 12 per cent\n1,560 1,545\ndue to increased usage by customers.

HKEX’s systems have continued to operate normally during the period.\n17\nCorporate Items\n“Corporate Items” is not a business segment but comprises central income (including net\ninvestment income from Corporate Funds and donation income of HKEX Foundation), the cost of\ncentral support functions that provide services to all operating segments, HKEX Foundation\ncharitable donations and other costs not directly related to any operating segments.\nAnalysis of Results\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\n$m $m\nNet investment income 1,408 1,177\nDonation income of HKEX Foundation 43 57\nOthers 15 12\nTotal revenue and other income 1,466 1,246\nOperating expenses:\n- HKEX Foundation charitable donations (81) (84)\n- Others (1,233) (1,183)\nEBITDA 152 (21)\nThe analysis of net investment income/(loss) of Corporate Funds is as follows:\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\n$m $m\nNet investment income/(loss) from:\n- External Portfolio 389 210\n- Cash and bank deposits1 900 918\n- Equity securities2 (24) (11)\n- Debt securities 154 42\n- Exchange (losses)/gains (11) 18\nTotal net investment income 1,408 1,177\nAverage fund size ($bn) 34.3 34.5\nAnnualised net investment return 5.48% 4.55%\n1 Including foreign exchange swaps\n2 Investments in minority stakes of unlisted companies\nNet investment income from Corporate Funds increased by $231 million compared with YTD Q3\n2023. This was due to higher net fair value gains on the External Portfolio, and increased\ninvestment income generated from internally managed Corporate Funds, reflecting higher\ninvestment return in YTD Q3 2024.\nThe net fair value gains/(losses) on the External Portfolio came from funds invested in the following\nstrategies:\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\nStrategy $m $m\nDiversifiers 193 161\nGovernment Bonds and Mortgage-backed Securities 50 (12)\nPublic Equities 146 61\nTotal 389 210\n18\nAs at 30 September 2024, the amounts invested in the External Portfolio amounted to $6,855\nmillion, an increase of 4 per cent against 31 December 2023, mainly attributable to fair value gains\nduring the period.

As a market regulator, HKEX continued to\npromote good corporate governance and ESG stewardship through market education and industry\nknowledge sharing, facilitating sustainable finance development through its platforms, and leading\nby example in its own operations. In September 2024, HKEX hosted an online training session for\nlisted companies and business sectors, providing practical guidance on adopting the IFRS\nSustainability Disclosure Standards in their disclosures. As an exchange operator in facilitating the\ntransition of low-carbon economy, HKEX introduced Gold Standard’s Verified Emission Reductions\nto its carbon marketplace, Core Climate, providing more options for investors and corporates to\nsupport climate projects.\nTo deliver on its commitment of achieving carbon neutrality by 2024, HKEX continued to work on\nabating its carbon emissions through using renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and\nremoving unabated emissions via quality carbon credits. In Q3 2024, HKEX confirmed its approach\nto procuring renewable energy certificates from local and regional power suppliers and sourcing\nafforestation carbon credits.\nAs part of its commitment to fostering a workplace that values employees’ wellness and\nengagement, HKEX ran the Global Wellness Month to promote and recognise the importance of\nholistic wellness with a range of activities supporting physical fitness, mental wellbeing, community\ngiving and financial wellness among the Group’s employees.\nTo ensure operational excellence as a trusted exchange operator, HKEX rolled out an information\nsecurity campaign and launched a new cybersecurity awareness hub to enhance employees’\nunderstanding of cyber threats and industry best practices.\nHKEX Foundation, the Group’s dedicated charitable channel, continued to drive positive impact in\nthe community through a range of programmes focusing on financial literacy, diversity and\ninclusion, poverty relief and environmental sustainability. During Q3 2024, the Foundation launched\nthe HKEX Charity Partnership Programme 2024 and the HKEX Impact Funding Scheme 2024,\nsupporting local social enterprises and charitable institutions to deliver impactful projects that\naddress social and environmental challenges in the community.\n19\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nNet Investment Income of Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds\nNet investment income from Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds decreased by $390 million\ncompared with YTD Q3 2023, reflecting the lower fund sizes, an increase in interest rebates\npayable to CPs for certain products as incentives to attract volume, and an increase in the\nproportion of JPY collateral posted by HKCC CPs during YTD Q3 2024. Further analysis on net\ninvestment income of Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds is set out below:\nYTD Q3 2024\nHK Clearing Houses LME Clear\nClearing Clearing\nMargin House Margin House\nFunds Funds Funds Funds Total\n$m $m $m $m $m\nNet investment income/(loss) from:\n- Cash and bank deposits (including\nforeign exchange swaps) 1,496 234 118 16 1,864\n- Debt securities 344 94 17 3 458\n- Exchange losses (2) - - - (2)\nTotal net investment income 1,838 328 135 19 2,320\nAverage fund size ($bn) 98.4 14.4 69.8 9.9 192.5\nAnnualised net investment return 2.49% 3.03% 0.26% 0.25% 1.61%\nYTD Q3 2023\nHK Clearing Houses LME Clear\nClearing Clearing\nMargin House Margin House\nFunds Funds Funds Funds Total\n$m $m $m $m $m\nNet investment income/(loss) from:\n- Cash and bank deposits (including\nforeign exchange swaps) 2,188 173 118 16 2,495\n- Debt securities 133 73 10 1 217\n- Exchange losses (2) - - - (2)\nTotal net investment income 2,319 246 128 17 2,710\nAverage fund size ($bn) 113.8 12.0 84.3 10.9 221.0\nAnnualised net investment return 2.72% 2.73% 0.20% 0.21% 1.63%\nNet investment income of Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds are allocated to the following\nsegments:\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\n$m $m Change\nCash 189 172 10%\nEquity and Financial Derivatives 1,977 2,393 (17%)\nCommodities 154 145 6%\nTotal 2,320 2,710 (14%)\n20\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities of Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds\nMargin Fund deposits of $232.3 billion at 30 September 2024 were $56.1 billion higher than 31\nDecember 2023 ($176.2 billion). This was attributable to higher contributions from HKSCC CPs\narising from the increased trading turnover at the end of September 2024; higher contributions\nfrom SEOCH CPs due to higher open positions and margin requirements of stock options, and an\nincrease in excess collateral posted by HKCC CPs. Clearing House Fund contributions of $30.1\nbillion were $8.1 billion higher than 31 December 2023 ($22.0 billion). The increase was due to the\nchange in counterparty default assumption for HKSCC Guarantee Fund to cover the two largest\nCP groups from 2 September 2024 (as opposed to the largest and the 5th largest CP groups prior\nto the change), as well as changes in risk exposures in the Cash and Commodities Markets. Funds\nreceived were invested in cash and cash equivalents and financial assets.\nCapital Expenditure and Commitments\nDuring YTD Q3 2024, the Group incurred capital expenditure6 of $1,027 million (YTD Q3 2023:\n$830 million) mainly related to the development and upgrade of various trading and clearing\nsystems (notably trading and clearing systems for Commodities Market and Derivatives Market).\nThe Group’s capital expenditure commitments at 30 September 2024, including those authorised\nby the Board but not yet contracted for, amounted to $1,506 million (31 December 2023: $1,555\nmillion). They were mainly related to the development and upgrade of IT systems including the\ncash, derivatives and commodities trading and clearing systems (notably the new trading and\nclearing systems for the Derivatives Market).\nContingent Liabilities\nAt 30 September 2024, there were no significant changes in the Group’s contingent liabilities\ncompared with 31 December 2023, except the material litigation as described below.\nThe LME and LME Clear were named as defendants in two judicial review claims filed in the\nEnglish High Court (the Court) in 2022 (the Proceedings) and three related claims filed in the Court\nin 2023. The total claims amount to approximately US$600 million.\nThe Proceedings sought to challenge the LME’s decision to cancel the claimants’ alleged trades in\nnickel contracts executed on or after 00:00 UK time on 8 March 2022. The claimants have alleged\nthat this was unlawful on public law grounds and/or constituted a violation of their human rights.\nOn 29 November 2023, the Court gave judgment in the LME and LME Clear’s favour on all\ngrounds, and ordered the claimants to pay the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Proceedings,\nwhich are to be assessed by the Court if not agreed with the claimants.\nOne of the claimants, Elliott7, sought and was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal\n(the Appeal). The Appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in July 2024. Judgment in respect of\nthe Appeal was handed down by the Court of Appeal subsequent to the period end on 7 October\n2024, in which the Court of Appeal found in the LME and LME Clear’s favour and dismissed the\nAppeal. Permission is required in order for Elliott to appeal the Appeal outcome to the Supreme\nCourt. Permission can be sought either from the Court of Appeal or, if the Court of Appeal declines\nto grant permission, from the Supreme Court itself.\nThe three related claims issued in March 2023 remain stayed, pending the final determination of\nthe Proceedings. The limitation period for similar damages claims under the Human Rights Act has\nnow expired.\nIn light of the judgments of the Court and the Court of Appeal, no provision has been made in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n6 Exclude right-of-use assets recognised under HKFRS 16: Leases\n7 Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P.\n21\nThe claimants made an interim payment of GBP5 million to the LME and LME Clear to cover part\nof their costs of the Proceedings in Q2 2024, and Elliott has made an interim payment of GBP1.06\nmillion in respect of the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Appeal in October 2024. The final\namount with respect to recovery of costs of the Proceedings and the Appeal will be assessed by\nthe Court if not agreed with the claimants in respect of the Proceedings and Elliott in respect of the\nAppeal.\nThe Group has not recognised any further recovery of costs as receivables in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2024.\nPledges of Assets\nLME Clear receives securities and gold bullion as non-cash collateral for margins posted by its\nCPs. The total fair value of this non-cash collateral was US$2,693 million (HK$20,918 million) at 30\nSeptember 2024 (31 December 2023: US$3,748 million (HK$29,266 million)). LME Clear is obliged\nto return this non-cash collateral upon request when the CPs’ collateral obligations have been\nsubstituted with cash collateral or otherwise discharged. LME Clear is permitted to sell or pledge\nsuch collateral in the event of the default of a CP. Any non-cash collateral lodged at central\nsecurities depositories or custodians is subject to a lien or pledge for the services they provide in\nrespect of the collateral held.\nLME Clear also holds securities as collateral in respect of its investments in overnight triparty\nreverse repurchase agreements under which it is obliged to return equivalent securities to the\ncounterparties at maturity of the reverse repurchase agreements. The fair value of this collateral\nwas US$9,162 million (HK$71,166 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023: US$9,095\nmillion (HK$71,019 million)). Such non-cash collateral, together with certain financial assets\namounting to US$1,775 million (HK$13,786 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023:\nUS$1,102 million (HK$8,604 million)), have been pledged to LME Clear’s investment agents and\ncustodian banks under security arrangements for the settlement and depository services they\nprovide in respect of the collateral and investments held.\nNon-cash collateral is not recorded on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position\nof the Group.\nChanges since 31 December 2023\nThere were no other significant changes in the Group’s financial position, or from the information\ndisclosed under Management Discussion and Analysis in the annual report for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nIt is the Group’s practice to declare a dividend only at the half-year and year-end and no dividend\nwill be proposed for Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: $Nil).\nReview of Financial Statements\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\n22\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nTrading fees and trading tariffs 4,979 4,676 1,689 1,494\nClearing and settlement fees 3,183 2,977 1,058 949\nStock Exchange listing fees 1,083 1,153 358 368\nDepository, custody and nominee services fees 888 898 346 342\nMarket data fees 806 818 274 281\nOther revenue 1,263 1,173 415 403\nRevenue 12,202 11,695 4,140 3,837\nNet investment income 3,728 3,887 1,207 1,211\nDonation income of HKEX Foundation 43 57 13 28\nSundry income 20 20 12 8\nRevenue and other income 15,993 15,659 5,372 5,084\nLess: Transaction-related expenses (247) (168) (81) (74)\nRevenue and other income le ss transaction-\nrelated expenses 15,746 15,491 5,291 5,010\nOperating expenses\nStaff costs and related expenses (2,860) (2,585) (923) (874)\nInformation technology and computer maintenance expenses (636) (583) (215) (202)\nPremises expenses (102) (100) (35) (36)\nProduct marketing and promotion expenses (78) (83) (25) (32)\nProfessional fees (109) (198) (63) (61)\nHKEX Foundation charitable donations (81) (84) (7) (7)\nOther operating expenses (293) (293) (97) (92)\n(4,159) (3,926) (1,365) (1,304)\nEBITDA (non -HKFRS measure ) 11,587 11,565 3,926 3,706\nDepreciation and amortisation (1,044) (1,081) (346) (362)\nOperating pr ofit 10,543 10,484 3,580 3,344\nFinance costs (86) (102) (27) (32)\nShare of profits of joint ventures 72 63 24 24\nProfit before taxation 10,529 10,445 3,577 3,336\nTaxation (1,175) (1,094) (409) (353)\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nProfit attribu table to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,270 9,265 3,145 2,953\n- Non-controlling interests 84 86 23 30\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nBasic earnin gs per share $7.33 $7.32 $2.49 $2.33\nDiluted earnings per share $7.31 $7.31 $2.48 $2.33\n23\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to\nprofit or loss:\nCurrency translation differences of foreign\nsubsidiaries (80) 19 (62) (10)\nCash flow hedges, net of tax 12 (38) 15 (52)\nChanges in fair value of financial assets\nmeasured at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income, net of tax 231 13 217 (43)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) 163 (6) 170 (105)\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\nTotal comprehensive income attributable to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,432 9,262 3,313 2,847\n- Non-controlling interests 85 83 25 31\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\n24\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(UNAUDITED)\nAt 30 Sept 2024 At 31 Dec 2023\nCurrent Non-current Total Current Non-current Total\n$m $m $m $m $m $m\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents 227,757 -

Basis of Preparation and Accounting Policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies and methods of computation used in the\npreparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent\nwith those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nAdoption of new/revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs)\nIn 2024, the Group has adopted the following amendments to HKFRSs which are pertinent to\nthe Group’s operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2024:\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of\nLiabilities as Current or Non-current\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities\nwith Covenants\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have any financial impact on the Group.\nFrom 1 January 2024, the estimated useful lives of computer trading and clearing software\nwere revised from “three to five years” to “three to ten years” to better reflect the useful life of\nthe assets. The financial impact of such change in accounting estimate was insignificant\nduring the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\nThe financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2023 that is included in this\nQuarterly Results Announcement as comparative information does not constitute the statutory\nannual consolidated financial statements of the Company for that year but is derived from\nthose consolidated financial statements. Further information relating to these statutory\nfinancial statements required to be disclosed in accordance with section 436 of the Hong Kong\nCompanies Ordinance (Chapter 622) is as follows:\nThe Company has delivered the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023 to the Registrar of Companies as required by section 662(3) of, and Part 3 of\nSchedule 6 to, the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622).\nThe Company’s auditor has reported on those consolidated financial statements. The auditor’s\nreport was unqualified; did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew\nattention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report; and did not contain a statement\nunder sections 406(2), 407(2) or (3) of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622).\nBy Order of the Board\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nTimothy Tsang\nGroup Company Secretary\nHong Kong, 23 October 2024\nAs at the date of this announcement, HKEX’s Board of Directors comprises 12 Independent\nNon-executive Directors, namely Mr Carlson TONG (Chairman), Mr Nicholas Charles ALLEN,\nMr Apurv BAGRI, Mr CHAN Kin Por, Mr CHEAH Cheng Hye, Ms CHEUNG Ming Ming, Anna,\nMrs CHOW WOO Mo Fong, Susan, Ms LEUNG Nisa Bernice Wing-Yu, Mr LEUNG Pak Hon, Hugo,\nMr YAM Chi Kwong, Joseph, Mr YAN King Shun, Peter and Mr ZHANG Yichen, and one Executive\nDirector, Ms CHAN Yiting, Bonnie, who is also the Chief Executive of HKEX.\n26"

Orion Derivatives Platform\nLooking ahead\n➢ The vibrancy and diversity of Hong Kong’s capital markets were on full display in Sep 2024, with multiple new daily\nrecord highs set in the Cash and Derivatives Markets. The strong momentum continued into Oct 2024: Cash Market MTD(1)\nADT at over HK$300 billion, MTD ADV of derivatives traded at over 2 million contracts during the period of heightened volatility,\nand continued strong flows via the Stock Connect.\n➢ The listing of Midea Group as the largest IPO in Asia in YTD 2024 further underscores the depth and attractiveness of our\nIPO market, boosting hopes for a revival of large equity deals from other Chinese companies.\n➢ LME continued to record strong growth in YTD 2024, driven by both volume and fee increase. The positive ruling by the UK\nCourt of Appeal hopefully ends the 2.5-year litigation and allows us to focus on the great opportunities ahead for the LME and our\nglobal commodities business.\n➢ We are cautiously optimistic in the outlook for Q4 2024 and into 2025, though macro environment uncertainties will\npersist. Various global macroeconomic and geopolitical developments could continue to weigh on sentiment, though the possible\nMainland economic boost supported by the stimulus measures, as well as the gradual interest rate cuts by central banks, should\nprovide support to the Cash Market.\n➢ Internally managed investment income in Q4 2024 / 2025 will continue to be affected by expectations of further interest rate\ncuts, while the derisking of External Portfolio should reduce volatility on HKEX earnings. Higher amortisation from launch of new\nLME trading platform and new tax rules will also weigh on HKEX earnings starting 2025.\n➢ Prudent, targeted investment in talent, technology, client and risk management will continue, supporting long-term success\nand sustainable development of the business.\n➢ We remain steadfast in our commitment to further enhancing vibrancy, resilience and competitiveness of our markets.\nWe are commissioning a white paper that explores the factors to be considered on what settlement cycle is needed for Hong\nKong’s Cash Market, to be published in 1H 2025.\n16\n1.

Online Request Form for shareholders  \n  \n**SHAREHOLDERS COMMUNICATION POLICY**\n\nIn order to enable shareholders to exercise their rights in an informed manner, and to allow them to engage actively with HKEX, HKEX establishes a [Shareholders Communication Policy](/-/media/HKEX-Group-Site/ssd/Corporate-Governance/Documents/shareholderpolicy_e.pdf \"Shareholders Communication Policy\") to ensure that shareholders are provided with ready, equal and timely access to balanced and understandable information about HKEX.\n\n**SHAREHOLDERS ’ GUIDE**\n\nHKEX has issued a [Shareholders’ Guide](/-/media/HKEX-Group-Site/ssd/Corporate-Governance/Documents/ShareholdersGuide_e.pdf \"Shareholders' Guide\") which sets out the frequently asked questions of HKEX’s shareholders and the answers thereto with the objective of providing shareholders with the necessary information about their share interest in HKEX in order to enable them to exercise their rights in an informed manner.\n\n**CORPORATE COMMUNICATION REQUESTS**\n\nCorporate Communication refers to any document issued or to be issued by HKEX for the information or action of holders of any of its securities, including, but not limited to, the directors’ report and annual accounts together with a copy of the auditor’s report, the interim report, a notice of meeting, a listing document, a circular and a proxy form. The English and Chinese versions of all HKEX Corporate Communications are available on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en) and the [HKEXnews website](https://www.hkexnews.hk/index.htm). Shareholders and investors who would like to be notified when HKEX publishes its Corporate Communications on the [HKEXnews website](https://www.hkexnews.hk/index.htm) can register for the News Alerts service in the Market Data section of the [HKEX Market website](https://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/invest/user/login_e.aspx). Pursuant to the[ Listing Rules](https://www.hkex.com.hk/Listing/Rules-and-Guidance/Listing-Rules?sc_lang=en), the [Hong Kong Companies Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/) and HKEX’s Articles of Association, HKEX supplies Corporate Communications (other than Actionable Corporate Communications) to shareholders by electronic means through the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en) and the [HKEXnews website](https://www.hkexnews.hk/index.htm) (“Electronic Version”), provided that the relevant shareholders have consented to receiving the Electronic Version. Where a Corporate Communication is issued to seek instructions from HKEX’s registered shareholders on how they wish to exercise their rights or make an election as shareholders (“Actionable Corporate Communication”), the Actionable Corporate Communications will be sent to registered shareholders individually by post to the shareholders’ addresses as they appear in HKEX’s register of members. HKEX will seek consent from each new registered shareholder to receiving the Electronic Version of all future Corporate Communications (other than Actionable Corporate Communications). To promote electronic dissemination of Corporate Communications, similar consent will be sought from existing registered shareholders annually at the time when HKEX publishes its annual report. If HKEX does not receive the duly completed Request Form (See \"Election of Language and Means of Receipt of Corporate Communications\" below for details) from a shareholder opting for printed copies (\"Printed Version\") within a period of 28 days, the registered shareholder will be deemed to have elected the Electronic Version. Upon posting of Corporate Communication(s) on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en), \n\n  * HKEX will despatch the Printed Version of the Corporate Communication(s) to the registered shareholders' addresses pursuant to their request (See “Election of Language and Means of Receipt of Corporate Communications” below for details), or if consent has not been sought from them to receiving the Electronic Version of Corporate Communications, or if the Corporate Communication(s) is/are Actionable Corporate Communication(s);\n  * a notification of posting of the Corporate Communication(s) on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en) will be sent to registered shareholders who have elected (or deemed to have elected) the Electronic Version, by email or, if no email addresses are provided, by post to their addresses as they appear in HKEX’s register of members. If any of these registered shareholders has difficulty in accessing the relevant Corporate Communication(s) electronically, or wishes to receive printed copies, HKEX will promptly upon his/her request send the Printed Version to him/her free of charge; and\n  * a notification of posting of the Corporate Communication(s) on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en) will be sent by email, or if no email addresses are provided, by post (together with the Printed Version if requested), to non-registered shareholders whose shares in HKEX (whether or not held through a broker or custodian) are kept in the Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCASS).\n\n\n\nRegistered shareholders and non-registered shareholders may at any time change their choice of language or means of receipt of Corporate Communications by giving written notice to HKEX’s registrar (See “Election of Language and Means of Receipt of Corporate Communications” below for details). **Election of Language and Means of Receipt of Corporate Communications** Upon publication of Corporate Communication(s) by HKEX on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en), a registered shareholder/non-registered shareholder, who wishes to receive the relevant Corporate Communication(s) in printed form or in a language version other than his/her existing choice, may submit their request to HKEX's registrar through the Online Request form via the QR code above or the Request Form (see below) by post to 17M Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen's Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, or by email to hkex.ecom@computershare.com.hk. A registered shareholder/non-registered shareholder may from time to time change his/her choice of language or means of receiving Corporate Communications with not less than seven days’ notice in writing to HKEX's registrar by submitting the Online Request Form via the QR code above or the Request Form (see below) by post to the above address, or by email to hkex.ecom@computershare.com.hk. The change request will apply to the next and subsequent Corporate Communications issued by HKEX (see below). A shareholder’s request for the Printed Version of future Corporate Communications issued by HKEX (see “Corporate Communication Requests” above for details) will remain valid until the instruction has been revoked or superseded or until the time when HKEX publishes its next annual report in the following year (whichever is earlier). A registered shareholder, who wishes to only receive email notification of the posting of Corporate Communications on the [HKEX Group website](https://www.hkexgroup.com/Investor-Relations/Regulatory-Disclosure/Announcements?sc_lang=en) in the future, may submit his/her request to HKEX's registrar the Online Request Form via the QR code above or the Request Form (see below) by post to the above address, or by email to hkex.ecom@computershare.com.hk. \n\nRequest Forms for registered shareholders and non-registered shareholders to change their choice of language or means of receiving Corporate Communications and/or to request the Printed Version are available for download below:\n\n-[Corporate Communication Request Form for Registered Shareholders](/-/media/HKEX-Group-Site/ssd/Investor-Relations/documents/requestform_Web_e_Registered.pdf) -[Corporate Communication Request Form for Non-registered Shareholders](/-/media/HKEX-Group-Site/ssd/Investor-Relations/documents/requestform_Web_e_NonRegistered.pdf)\n\nShareholders who have any queries in relation to election of language and means of receipt of Corporate Communications may send their queries by submitting the Online Request Form via the QR code above or call the enquiry hotline of HKEX’s registrar on (852) 2862 8688 during business hours (9:00 am to 6:00 pm, Monday to Friday, excluding Hong Kong public holidays.\n\n**Privacy Notice** Please refer to HKEX's [Privacy Notice for Annual General Meeting and Corporate Communications](/-/media/HKEX-Group-Site/ssd/Corporate-Governance/Documents/PrivacyNotice_e.pdf) for further details of how HKEX shall process and protect personal data of its Shareholders that have been submitted to HKEX for the purpose of their Corporate Communication requests and of their respective rights. \n\n**REPLACEMENT OF LOST SHARE CERTIFICATES**\n\nA share certificate issued by HKEX is a proof of the shareholder's title to shares in HKEX. If a shareholder lost any share certificate, he/she should report to HKEX’s registrar and apply for the issue of a replacement share certificate as soon as possible. A replacement share certificate will be issued subject to the fulfillment of such conditions as to evidence and provision of indemnity as the Company may consider appropriate, as well as payment of the scrip fee and relevant administration costs involved.\n\nPursuant to the [Companies Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/ \"Companies Ordinance\") (Chapter 622 of the Laws of Hong Kong), HKEX is required to publish notices in specified form before replacement of lost share certificates, which include, among other things, a Notice of Intention to Issue New Share Certificates, and a Notice of Cancellation of Original Share Certificate and Issue of New Certificate on its website. Shareholders may refer to the aforesaid notices set out below.\n\n[Notices of Intention to Issue New Share Certificates (made pursuant to section 164(1) of the Companies Ordinance) ](http://www.computershare.com/hk/en/lost-certs/Pages/default.aspx?companycode=00388 \"Notices of Intention to Issue New Share Certificates \\(made pursuant to section 164\\(1\\) of the Companies Ordinance\\)\") [Notices of Cancellation of Original Share Certificate and Issue of New Certificate (made pursuant to section 166(1) of the Companies Ordinance)](http://www.computershare.com/hk/en/lost-certs/Pages/default.aspx?companycode=00388 \"Notices of Cancellation of Original Share Certificate and Issue of New Certificate \\(made pursuant to section 166\\(1\\) of the Companies Ordinance\\)\")\n\n[Site Map](/Global/Exchange/Site-Map?sc_lang=en \"Site Map\")[Disclaimer](/Global/Exchange/Disclaimer?sc_lang=en \"Disclaimer\")[Hyperlink Policy](/Global/Exchange/Hyperlink-Policy?sc_lang=en \"Hyperlink Policy\")[Privacy Notice](https://www.hkex.com.hk/global/exchange/privacy-notice?sc_lang=en \"Privacy Notice\")[Cookie Notice](https://www.hkex.com.hk/Global/Exchange/Cookie-Notice?sc_lang=en \"Cookie Notice\")\n\nFollow Us:\n\n[Follow HKEX on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hkexgroup \"Follow HKEX on Twitter\")[Follow HKEX on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hkex \"Follow HKEX on LinkedIn\")[Follow us on WeChat](/Global/WeChat?sc_lang=en \"Follow us on WeChat\")[Follow HKEX on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hkexgroup \"Follow HKEX on Youtube\")[RSS Feeds](/Global/RSS-Feeds?sc_lang=en \"RSS Feeds\")\n\n©2016-24 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.

The vibrancy and\ndiversity of Hong Kong’s markets were on full display in late September, as investor sentiment turned more favourable\nfollowing the announcement of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, as well as the monetary easing policies\nadopted by major central banks. This drove strong volumes in all our markets, with multiple daily records achieved across\nthe Cash, Derivatives, ETP and Northbound and Southbound Stock Connect markets. Furthermore, the Commodities\nmarket extended its robust performance in the third quarter, reporting a 25 per cent year-on-year gain in LME chargeable\naverage daily volumes during the nine-month period, contributing to the strength in the Group’s results during this period.\nThe recent listing on the Exchange of Asia’s largest and the world’s second-biggest IPO this year, along with the strength\nof follow-on offering volumes, underscore the depth and attractiveness of our markets, whilst a healthy listing pipeline\nreinforces our position as the region’s IPO fundraising centre of choice. Moreover, Alibaba’s conversion to a dual primary\nlisting, and its subsequent inclusion in Stock Connect, highlights how such a structure can help companies effectively tap\ninto Mainland China’s capital pool and enhance liquidity.\nAs part of our strategic efforts, HKEX successfully implemented Severe Weather Trading arrangements in the Securities\nand Derivatives Markets. This reinforces Hong Kong’s status as the best-in-class international trading and risk\nmanagement hub, aligning us with global standards.

Several new daily records were set in the Cash and\nDerivatives Markets in September, including the Cash Market trading turnover, Northbound and\nSouthbound Stock Connect trading turnover, and the Derivatives Market trading volume. The IPO\nmarket also recorded considerable growth, with the listing of Midea Group Co., Ltd. in Q3, being\nthe largest IPO in Asia and the second largest IPO globally in YTD Q3 2024.\nDriven by the positive market sentiment, Q3 2024 revenue and other income reached a record\nthird-quarter high of $5.4 billion, up 6 per cent compared with Q3 2023, reflecting higher trading\nand clearing fees from higher volumes across the Cash, Derivatives and Commodities Markets,\nand increased net fair value gains of the External Portfolio (Q3 2024: gains of $156 million; Q3\n2023: losses of $5 million), partly offset by lower net investment income from Margin Funds.\nOperating expenses were up 5 per cent against Q3 2023, attributable to higher staff and IT costs.\nAs a result, profit for Q3 2024 was 7 per cent higher than Q3 2023. Comparing Q3 results with the\nprevious quarter (which reached record second-quarter highs for both revenue and profit), revenue\nand other income was down 1 per cent, and profit was down marginally by $10 million, reflecting a\nmodest decrease in trading volumes across all markets.\nFor YTD Q3 2024, Headline ADT was 3 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The Group’s\nDerivatives Market and Commodities Market continued their growth momentum of 1H 2024 and\nperformed strongly, with ADV of derivatives contracts traded reaching a record nine-month high, up\n12 per cent compared with YTD Q3 2023, and chargeable ADV of metals contracts traded on the\nLME up 25 per cent against YTD Q3 2023.\n2 HKEX and its subsidiaries, which include The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK or the Stock Exchange), Hong Kong Futures\nExchange Limited (HKFE or the Futures Exchange), Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC), HKFE Clearing Corporation\nLimited (HKCC), The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited (SEOCH), OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTC Clear), The London Metal\nExchange (LME), LME Clear Limited (LME Clear), Qianhai Mercantile Exchange Co., Ltd. (QME), BayConnect Technology Company Limited\n(BayConnect) and other subsidiaries\n6\nRevenue and other income of $16.0 billion was 2 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The increase\nwas attributable to higher trading and clearing fees from the higher trading volumes across all\nmarkets and the LME fee increment effective from 1 January 2024, and higher net fair value gains\nof the External Portfolio (YTD Q3 2024: $389 million; YTD Q3 2023: $210 million), but partly offset\nby lower net investment income of the Margin Funds. Operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 6\nper cent against YTD Q3 2023, due to higher staff costs arising from increases in headcount and\npayroll adjustments, and an increase in IT costs due to new or upgraded systems and inflationary\nadjustments on contract renewals. The increase was partly offset by the lower professional fees\nincurred for, and the partial recovery of legal fees from claimants of, the events in the nickel market\nin 2022.\nAnalysis of Results and Business Update by Operating Segment\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\nRevenue and Revenue and\nother income other income\nless less\nRevenue Transaction- transaction- Revenue Transaction- transaction-\nand other related related and other related related\nincome expenses expenses EBITDA income expenses expenses EBITDA\n$m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m\nResults by segment:\nCash 6,351 (7) 6,344 5,393 6,235 (8) 6,227 5,382\nEquity and Financial\nDerivatives 4,517 (240) 4,277 3,611 5,035 (160) 4,875 4,240\nCommodities 2,099 - 2,099 1,189 1,598 - 1,598 740\nData and Connectivity 1,560 - 1,560 1,242 1,545 - 1,545 1,224\nCorporate Items 1,466 - 1,466 152 1,246 - 1,246 (21)\n15,993 (247) 15,746 11,587 15,659 (168) 15,491 11,565\n7\nCash Segment\nAnalysis of Results\nRevenue and other income, less transaction-\nrelated expenses, was up 2 per cent due to the Y TD Q3 2024 vs YTD Q3 2023 ($m)\nincrease in trading and clearing volumes.

As a market regulator, HKEX continued to\npromote good corporate governance and ESG stewardship through market education and industry\nknowledge sharing, facilitating sustainable finance development through its platforms, and leading\nby example in its own operations. In September 2024, HKEX hosted an online training session for\nlisted companies and business sectors, providing practical guidance on adopting the IFRS\nSustainability Disclosure Standards in their disclosures.

This was attributable to higher contributions from HKSCC CPs\narising from the increased trading turnover at the end of September 2024; higher contributions\nfrom SEOCH CPs due to higher open positions and margin requirements of stock options, and an\nincrease in excess collateral posted by HKCC CPs. Clearing House Fund contributions of $30.1\nbillion were $8.1 billion higher than 31 December 2023 ($22.0 billion). The increase was due to the\nchange in counterparty default assumption for HKSCC Guarantee Fund to cover the two largest\nCP groups from 2 September 2024 (as opposed to the largest and the 5th largest CP groups prior\nto the change), as well as changes in risk exposures in the Cash and Commodities Markets. Funds\nreceived were invested in cash and cash equivalents and financial assets.\nCapital Expenditure and Commitments\nDuring YTD Q3 2024, the Group incurred capital expenditure6 of $1,027 million (YTD Q3 2023:\n$830 million) mainly related to the development and upgrade of various trading and clearing\nsystems (notably trading and clearing systems for Commodities Market and Derivatives Market).\nThe Group’s capital expenditure commitments at 30 September 2024, including those authorised\nby the Board but not yet contracted for, amounted to $1,506 million (31 December 2023: $1,555\nmillion). They were mainly related to the development and upgrade of IT systems including the\ncash, derivatives and commodities trading and clearing systems (notably the new trading and\nclearing systems for the Derivatives Market).\nContingent Liabilities\nAt 30 September 2024, there were no significant changes in the Group’s contingent liabilities\ncompared with 31 December 2023, except the material litigation as described below.\nThe LME and LME Clear were named as defendants in two judicial review claims filed in the\nEnglish High Court (the Court) in 2022 (the Proceedings) and three related claims filed in the Court\nin 2023. The total claims amount to approximately US$600 million.\nThe Proceedings sought to challenge the LME’s decision to cancel the claimants’ alleged trades in\nnickel contracts executed on or after 00:00 UK time on 8 March 2022. The claimants have alleged\nthat this was unlawful on public law grounds and/or constituted a violation of their human rights.\nOn 29 November 2023, the Court gave judgment in the LME and LME Clear’s favour on all\ngrounds, and ordered the claimants to pay the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Proceedings,\nwhich are to be assessed by the Court if not agreed with the claimants.\nOne of the claimants, Elliott7, sought and was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal\n(the Appeal). The Appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in July 2024. Judgment in respect of\nthe Appeal was handed down by the Court of Appeal subsequent to the period end on 7 October\n2024, in which the Court of Appeal found in the LME and LME Clear’s favour and dismissed the\nAppeal. Permission is required in order for Elliott to appeal the Appeal outcome to the Supreme\nCourt. Permission can be sought either from the Court of Appeal or, if the Court of Appeal declines\nto grant permission, from the Supreme Court itself.\nThe three related claims issued in March 2023 remain stayed, pending the final determination of\nthe Proceedings. The limitation period for similar damages claims under the Human Rights Act has\nnow expired.\nIn light of the judgments of the Court and the Court of Appeal, no provision has been made in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n6 Exclude right-of-use assets recognised under HKFRS 16: Leases\n7 Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P.\n21\nThe claimants made an interim payment of GBP5 million to the LME and LME Clear to cover part\nof their costs of the Proceedings in Q2 2024, and Elliott has made an interim payment of GBP1.06\nmillion in respect of the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Appeal in October 2024. The final\namount with respect to recovery of costs of the Proceedings and the Appeal will be assessed by\nthe Court if not agreed with the claimants in respect of the Proceedings and Elliott in respect of the\nAppeal.\nThe Group has not recognised any further recovery of costs as receivables in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2024.\nPledges of Assets\nLME Clear receives securities and gold bullion as non-cash collateral for margins posted by its\nCPs. The total fair value of this non-cash collateral was US$2,693 million (HK$20,918 million) at 30\nSeptember 2024 (31 December 2023: US$3,748 million (HK$29,266 million)). LME Clear is obliged\nto return this non-cash collateral upon request when the CPs’ collateral obligations have been\nsubstituted with cash collateral or otherwise discharged. LME Clear is permitted to sell or pledge\nsuch collateral in the event of the default of a CP. Any non-cash collateral lodged at central\nsecurities depositories or custodians is subject to a lien or pledge for the services they provide in\nrespect of the collateral held.\nLME Clear also holds securities as collateral in respect of its investments in overnight triparty\nreverse repurchase agreements under which it is obliged to return equivalent securities to the\ncounterparties at maturity of the reverse repurchase agreements. The fair value of this collateral\nwas US$9,162 million (HK$71,166 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023: US$9,095\nmillion (HK$71,019 million)). Such non-cash collateral, together with certain financial assets\namounting to US$1,775 million (HK$13,786 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023:\nUS$1,102 million (HK$8,604 million)), have been pledged to LME Clear’s investment agents and\ncustodian banks under security arrangements for the settlement and depository services they\nprovide in respect of the collateral and investments held.\nNon-cash collateral is not recorded on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position\nof the Group.\nChanges since 31 December 2023\nThere were no other significant changes in the Group’s financial position, or from the information\ndisclosed under Management Discussion and Analysis in the annual report for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nIt is the Group’s practice to declare a dividend only at the half-year and year-end and no dividend\nwill be proposed for Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: $Nil).\nReview of Financial Statements\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\n22\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nTrading fees and trading tariffs 4,979 4,676 1,689 1,494\nClearing and settlement fees 3,183 2,977 1,058 949\nStock Exchange listing fees 1,083 1,153 358 368\nDepository, custody and nominee services fees 888 898 346 342\nMarket data fees 806 818 274 281\nOther revenue 1,263 1,173 415 403\nRevenue 12,202 11,695 4,140 3,837\nNet investment income 3,728 3,887 1,207 1,211\nDonation income of HKEX Foundation 43 57 13 28\nSundry income 20 20 12 8\nRevenue and other income 15,993 15,659 5,372 5,084\nLess: Transaction-related expenses (247) (168) (81) (74)\nRevenue and other income le ss transaction-\nrelated expenses 15,746 15,491 5,291 5,010\nOperating expenses\nStaff costs and related expenses (2,860) (2,585) (923) (874)\nInformation technology and computer maintenance expenses (636) (583) (215) (202)\nPremises expenses (102) (100) (35) (36)\nProduct marketing and promotion expenses (78) (83) (25) (32)\nProfessional fees (109) (198) (63) (61)\nHKEX Foundation charitable donations (81) (84) (7) (7)\nOther operating expenses (293) (293) (97) (92)\n(4,159) (3,926) (1,365) (1,304)\nEBITDA (non -HKFRS measure ) 11,587 11,565 3,926 3,706\nDepreciation and amortisation (1,044) (1,081) (346) (362)\nOperating pr ofit 10,543 10,484 3,580 3,344\nFinance costs (86) (102) (27) (32)\nShare of profits of joint ventures 72 63 24 24\nProfit before taxation 10,529 10,445 3,577 3,336\nTaxation (1,175) (1,094) (409) (353)\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nProfit attribu table to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,270 9,265 3,145 2,953\n- Non-controlling interests 84 86 23 30\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nBasic earnin gs per share $7.33 $7.32 $2.49 $2.33\nDiluted earnings per share $7.31 $7.31 $2.48 $2.33\n23\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to\nprofit or loss:\nCurrency translation differences of foreign\nsubsidiaries (80) 19 (62) (10)\nCash flow hedges, net of tax 12 (38) 15 (52)\nChanges in fair value of financial assets\nmeasured at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income, net of tax 231 13 217 (43)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) 163 (6) 170 (105)\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\nTotal comprehensive income attributable to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,432 9,262 3,313 2,847\n- Non-controlling interests 85 83 25 31\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\n24\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(UNAUDITED)\nAt 30 Sept 2024 At 31 Dec 2023\nCurrent Non-current Total Current Non-current Total\n$m $m $m $m $m $m\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents 227,757 -

Basis of Preparation and Accounting Policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies and methods of computation used in the\npreparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent\nwith those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nAdoption of new/revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs)\nIn 2024, the Group has adopted the following amendments to HKFRSs which are pertinent to\nthe Group’s operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2024:\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of\nLiabilities as Current or Non-current\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities\nwith Covenants\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have any financial impact on the Group.\nFrom 1 January 2024, the estimated useful lives of computer trading and clearing software\nwere revised from “three to five years” to “three to ten years” to better reflect the useful life of\nthe assets. The financial impact of such change in accounting estimate was insignificant\nduring the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\nThe financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2023 that is included in this\nQuarterly Results Announcement as comparative information does not constitute the statutory\nannual consolidated financial statements of the Company for that year but is derived from\nthose consolidated financial statements.

The auditor’s\nreport was unqualified; did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew\nattention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report; and did not contain a statement\nunder sections 406(2), 407(2) or (3) of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622).\nBy Order of the Board\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nTimothy Tsang\nGroup Company Secretary\nHong Kong, 23 October 2024\nAs at the date of this announcement, HKEX’s Board of Directors comprises 12 Independent\nNon-executive Directors, namely Mr Carlson TONG (Chairman), Mr Nicholas Charles ALLEN,\nMr Apurv BAGRI, Mr CHAN Kin Por, Mr CHEAH Cheng Hye, Ms CHEUNG Ming Ming, Anna,\nMrs CHOW WOO Mo Fong, Susan, Ms LEUNG Nisa Bernice Wing-Yu, Mr LEUNG Pak Hon, Hugo,\nMr YAM Chi Kwong, Joseph, Mr YAN King Shun, Peter and Mr ZHANG Yichen, and one Executive\nDirector, Ms CHAN Yiting, Bonnie, who is also the Chief Executive of HKEX.\n26"

The vibrancy and\ndiversity of Hong Kong’s markets were on full display in late September, as investor sentiment turned more favourable\nfollowing the announcement of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, as well as the monetary easing policies\nadopted by major central banks. This drove strong volumes in all our markets, with multiple daily records achieved across\nthe Cash, Derivatives, ETP and Northbound and Southbound Stock Connect markets. Furthermore, the Commodities\nmarket extended its robust performance in the third quarter, reporting a 25 per cent year-on-year gain in LME chargeable\naverage daily volumes during the nine-month period, contributing to the strength in the Group’s results during this period.\nThe recent listing on the Exchange of Asia’s largest and the world’s second-biggest IPO this year, along with the strength\nof follow-on offering volumes, underscore the depth and attractiveness of our markets, whilst a healthy listing pipeline\nreinforces our position as the region’s IPO fundraising centre of choice. Moreover, Alibaba’s conversion to a dual primary\nlisting, and its subsequent inclusion in Stock Connect, highlights how such a structure can help companies effectively tap\ninto Mainland China’s capital pool and enhance liquidity.\nAs part of our strategic efforts, HKEX successfully implemented Severe Weather Trading arrangements in the Securities\nand Derivatives Markets. This reinforces Hong Kong’s status as the best-in-class international trading and risk\nmanagement hub, aligning us with global standards. Additionally, we enhanced the Self-Match Prevention service in the\nDerivatives Market, and introduced Weekly Hang Seng TECH Index Options.\nLooking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to further enhancing the vibrancy, resilience, and competitiveness\nof our markets. By continuously expanding our product offerings, forging international partnerships, and investing in our\ninfrastructure, we are well positioned to navigate the evolving macro-environment and propel sustained growth.

Several new daily records were set in the Cash and\nDerivatives Markets in September, including the Cash Market trading turnover, Northbound and\nSouthbound Stock Connect trading turnover, and the Derivatives Market trading volume. The IPO\nmarket also recorded considerable growth, with the listing of Midea Group Co., Ltd. in Q3, being\nthe largest IPO in Asia and the second largest IPO globally in YTD Q3 2024.\nDriven by the positive market sentiment, Q3 2024 revenue and other income reached a record\nthird-quarter high of $5.4 billion, up 6 per cent compared with Q3 2023, reflecting higher trading\nand clearing fees from higher volumes across the Cash, Derivatives and Commodities Markets,\nand increased net fair value gains of the External Portfolio (Q3 2024: gains of $156 million; Q3\n2023: losses of $5 million), partly offset by lower net investment income from Margin Funds.\nOperating expenses were up 5 per cent against Q3 2023, attributable to higher staff and IT costs.\nAs a result, profit for Q3 2024 was 7 per cent higher than Q3 2023. Comparing Q3 results with the\nprevious quarter (which reached record second-quarter highs for both revenue and profit), revenue\nand other income was down 1 per cent, and profit was down marginally by $10 million, reflecting a\nmodest decrease in trading volumes across all markets.\nFor YTD Q3 2024, Headline ADT was 3 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The Group’s\nDerivatives Market and Commodities Market continued their growth momentum of 1H 2024 and\nperformed strongly, with ADV of derivatives contracts traded reaching a record nine-month high, up\n12 per cent compared with YTD Q3 2023, and chargeable ADV of metals contracts traded on the\nLME up 25 per cent against YTD Q3 2023.\n2 HKEX and its subsidiaries, which include The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK or the Stock Exchange), Hong Kong Futures\nExchange Limited (HKFE or the Futures Exchange), Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC), HKFE Clearing Corporation\nLimited (HKCC), The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited (SEOCH), OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTC Clear), The London Metal\nExchange (LME), LME Clear Limited (LME Clear), Qianhai Mercantile Exchange Co., Ltd. (QME), BayConnect Technology Company Limited\n(BayConnect) and other subsidiaries\n6\nRevenue and other income of $16.0 billion was 2 per cent higher than YTD Q3 2023. The increase\nwas attributable to higher trading and clearing fees from the higher trading volumes across all\nmarkets and the LME fee increment effective from 1 January 2024, and higher net fair value gains\nof the External Portfolio (YTD Q3 2024: $389 million; YTD Q3 2023: $210 million), but partly offset\nby lower net investment income of the Margin Funds. Operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 6\nper cent against YTD Q3 2023, due to higher staff costs arising from increases in headcount and\npayroll adjustments, and an increase in IT costs due to new or upgraded systems and inflationary\nadjustments on contract renewals. The increase was partly offset by the lower professional fees\nincurred for, and the partial recovery of legal fees from claimants of, the events in the nickel market\nin 2022.\nAnalysis of Results and Business Update by Operating Segment\nYTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\nRevenue and Revenue and\nother income other income\nless less\nRevenue Transaction- transaction- Revenue Transaction- transaction-\nand other related related and other related related\nincome expenses expenses EBITDA income expenses expenses EBITDA\n$m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m\nResults by segment:\nCash 6,351 (7) 6,344 5,393 6,235 (8) 6,227 5,382\nEquity and Financial\nDerivatives 4,517 (240) 4,277 3,611 5,035 (160) 4,875 4,240\nCommodities 2,099 - 2,099 1,189 1,598 - 1,598 740\nData and Connectivity 1,560 - 1,560 1,242 1,545 - 1,545 1,224\nCorporate Items 1,466 - 1,466 152 1,246 - 1,246 (21)\n15,993 (247) 15,746 11,587 15,659 (168) 15,491 11,565\n7\nCash Segment\nAnalysis of Results\nRevenue and other income, less transaction-\nrelated expenses, was up 2 per cent due to the Y TD Q3 2024 vs YTD Q3 2023 ($m)\nincrease in trading and clearing volumes.

As a market regulator, HKEX continued to\npromote good corporate governance and ESG stewardship through market education and industry\nknowledge sharing, facilitating sustainable finance development through its platforms, and leading\nby example in its own operations. In September 2024, HKEX hosted an online training session for\nlisted companies and business sectors, providing practical guidance on adopting the IFRS\nSustainability Disclosure Standards in their disclosures.

This was attributable to higher contributions from HKSCC CPs\narising from the increased trading turnover at the end of September 2024; higher contributions\nfrom SEOCH CPs due to higher open positions and margin requirements of stock options, and an\nincrease in excess collateral posted by HKCC CPs. Clearing House Fund contributions of $30.1\nbillion were $8.1 billion higher than 31 December 2023 ($22.0 billion). The increase was due to the\nchange in counterparty default assumption for HKSCC Guarantee Fund to cover the two largest\nCP groups from 2 September 2024 (as opposed to the largest and the 5th largest CP groups prior\nto the change), as well as changes in risk exposures in the Cash and Commodities Markets. Funds\nreceived were invested in cash and cash equivalents and financial assets.\nCapital Expenditure and Commitments\nDuring YTD Q3 2024, the Group incurred capital expenditure6 of $1,027 million (YTD Q3 2023:\n$830 million) mainly related to the development and upgrade of various trading and clearing\nsystems (notably trading and clearing systems for Commodities Market and Derivatives Market).\nThe Group’s capital expenditure commitments at 30 September 2024, including those authorised\nby the Board but not yet contracted for, amounted to $1,506 million (31 December 2023: $1,555\nmillion). They were mainly related to the development and upgrade of IT systems including the\ncash, derivatives and commodities trading and clearing systems (notably the new trading and\nclearing systems for the Derivatives Market).\nContingent Liabilities\nAt 30 September 2024, there were no significant changes in the Group’s contingent liabilities\ncompared with 31 December 2023, except the material litigation as described below.\nThe LME and LME Clear were named as defendants in two judicial review claims filed in the\nEnglish High Court (the Court) in 2022 (the Proceedings) and three related claims filed in the Court\nin 2023. The total claims amount to approximately US$600 million.\nThe Proceedings sought to challenge the LME’s decision to cancel the claimants’ alleged trades in\nnickel contracts executed on or after 00:00 UK time on 8 March 2022. The claimants have alleged\nthat this was unlawful on public law grounds and/or constituted a violation of their human rights.\nOn 29 November 2023, the Court gave judgment in the LME and LME Clear’s favour on all\ngrounds, and ordered the claimants to pay the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Proceedings,\nwhich are to be assessed by the Court if not agreed with the claimants.\nOne of the claimants, Elliott7, sought and was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal\n(the Appeal). The Appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in July 2024. Judgment in respect of\nthe Appeal was handed down by the Court of Appeal subsequent to the period end on 7 October\n2024, in which the Court of Appeal found in the LME and LME Clear’s favour and dismissed the\nAppeal. Permission is required in order for Elliott to appeal the Appeal outcome to the Supreme\nCourt. Permission can be sought either from the Court of Appeal or, if the Court of Appeal declines\nto grant permission, from the Supreme Court itself.\nThe three related claims issued in March 2023 remain stayed, pending the final determination of\nthe Proceedings. The limitation period for similar damages claims under the Human Rights Act has\nnow expired.\nIn light of the judgments of the Court and the Court of Appeal, no provision has been made in the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n6 Exclude right-of-use assets recognised under HKFRS 16: Leases\n7 Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P.\n21\nThe claimants made an interim payment of GBP5 million to the LME and LME Clear to cover part\nof their costs of the Proceedings in Q2 2024, and Elliott has made an interim payment of GBP1.06\nmillion in respect of the LME and LME Clear’s costs of the Appeal in October 2024. The final\namount with respect to recovery of costs of the Proceedings and the Appeal will be assessed by\nthe Court if not agreed with the claimants in respect of the Proceedings and Elliott in respect of the\nAppeal.\nThe Group has not recognised any further recovery of costs as receivables in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2024.\nPledges of Assets\nLME Clear receives securities and gold bullion as non-cash collateral for margins posted by its\nCPs. The total fair value of this non-cash collateral was US$2,693 million (HK$20,918 million) at 30\nSeptember 2024 (31 December 2023: US$3,748 million (HK$29,266 million)). LME Clear is obliged\nto return this non-cash collateral upon request when the CPs’ collateral obligations have been\nsubstituted with cash collateral or otherwise discharged. LME Clear is permitted to sell or pledge\nsuch collateral in the event of the default of a CP. Any non-cash collateral lodged at central\nsecurities depositories or custodians is subject to a lien or pledge for the services they provide in\nrespect of the collateral held.\nLME Clear also holds securities as collateral in respect of its investments in overnight triparty\nreverse repurchase agreements under which it is obliged to return equivalent securities to the\ncounterparties at maturity of the reverse repurchase agreements. The fair value of this collateral\nwas US$9,162 million (HK$71,166 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023: US$9,095\nmillion (HK$71,019 million)). Such non-cash collateral, together with certain financial assets\namounting to US$1,775 million (HK$13,786 million) at 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023:\nUS$1,102 million (HK$8,604 million)), have been pledged to LME Clear’s investment agents and\ncustodian banks under security arrangements for the settlement and depository services they\nprovide in respect of the collateral and investments held.\nNon-cash collateral is not recorded on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position\nof the Group.\nChanges since 31 December 2023\nThere were no other significant changes in the Group’s financial position, or from the information\ndisclosed under Management Discussion and Analysis in the annual report for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nIt is the Group’s practice to declare a dividend only at the half-year and year-end and no dividend\nwill be proposed for Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: $Nil).\nReview of Financial Statements\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\n22\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nTrading fees and trading tariffs 4,979 4,676 1,689 1,494\nClearing and settlement fees 3,183 2,977 1,058 949\nStock Exchange listing fees 1,083 1,153 358 368\nDepository, custody and nominee services fees 888 898 346 342\nMarket data fees 806 818 274 281\nOther revenue 1,263 1,173 415 403\nRevenue 12,202 11,695 4,140 3,837\nNet investment income 3,728 3,887 1,207 1,211\nDonation income of HKEX Foundation 43 57 13 28\nSundry income 20 20 12 8\nRevenue and other income 15,993 15,659 5,372 5,084\nLess: Transaction-related expenses (247) (168) (81) (74)\nRevenue and other income le ss transaction-\nrelated expenses 15,746 15,491 5,291 5,010\nOperating expenses\nStaff costs and related expenses (2,860) (2,585) (923) (874)\nInformation technology and computer maintenance expenses (636) (583) (215) (202)\nPremises expenses (102) (100) (35) (36)\nProduct marketing and promotion expenses (78) (83) (25) (32)\nProfessional fees (109) (198) (63) (61)\nHKEX Foundation charitable donations (81) (84) (7) (7)\nOther operating expenses (293) (293) (97) (92)\n(4,159) (3,926) (1,365) (1,304)\nEBITDA (non -HKFRS measure ) 11,587 11,565 3,926 3,706\nDepreciation and amortisation (1,044) (1,081) (346) (362)\nOperating pr ofit 10,543 10,484 3,580 3,344\nFinance costs (86) (102) (27) (32)\nShare of profits of joint ventures 72 63 24 24\nProfit before taxation 10,529 10,445 3,577 3,336\nTaxation (1,175) (1,094) (409) (353)\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nProfit attribu table to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,270 9,265 3,145 2,953\n- Non-controlling interests 84 86 23 30\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nBasic earnin gs per share $7.33 $7.32 $2.49 $2.33\nDiluted earnings per share $7.31 $7.31 $2.48 $2.33\n23\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(UNAUDITED)\nNine months Nine months Three months Three months\nended ended ended ended\n30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023 30 Sept 2024 30 Sept 2023\n$m $m $m $m\nProfit for the period 9,354 9,351 3,168 2,983\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to\nprofit or loss:\nCurrency translation differences of foreign\nsubsidiaries (80) 19 (62) (10)\nCash flow hedges, net of tax 12 (38) 15 (52)\nChanges in fair value of financial assets\nmeasured at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income, net of tax 231 13 217 (43)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) 163 (6) 170 (105)\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\nTotal comprehensive income attributable to:\n- Shareholders of HKEX 9,432 9,262 3,313 2,847\n- Non-controlling interests 85 83 25 31\nTotal comprehensive income 9,517 9,345 3,338 2,878\n24\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(UNAUDITED)\nAt 30 Sept 2024 At 31 Dec 2023\nCurrent Non-current Total Current Non-current Total\n$m $m $m $m $m $m\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents 227,757 -

Basis of Preparation and Accounting Policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies and methods of computation used in the\npreparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent\nwith those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023.\nAdoption of new/revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs)\nIn 2024, the Group has adopted the following amendments to HKFRSs which are pertinent to\nthe Group’s operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2024:\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of\nLiabilities as Current or Non-current\nAmendments to HKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities\nwith Covenants\nThe adoption of these amendments did not have any financial impact on the Group.\nFrom 1 January 2024, the estimated useful lives of computer trading and clearing software\nwere revised from “three to five years” to “three to ten years” to better reflect the useful life of\nthe assets. The financial impact of such change in accounting estimate was insignificant\nduring the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\nThe financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2023 that is included in this\nQuarterly Results Announcement as comparative information does not constitute the statutory\nannual consolidated financial statements of the Company for that year but is derived from\nthose consolidated financial statements. Further information relating to these statutory\nfinancial statements required to be disclosed in accordance with section 436 of the Hong Kong\nCompanies Ordinance (Chapter 622) is as follows:\nThe Company has delivered the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023 to the Registrar of Companies as required by section 662(3) of, and Part 3 of\nSchedule 6 to, the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622).\nThe Company’s auditor has reported on those consolidated financial statements. The auditor’s\nreport was unqualified; did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew\nattention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report; and did not contain a statement\nunder sections 406(2), 407(2) or (3) of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622).\nBy Order of the Board\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nTimothy Tsang\nGroup Company Secretary\nHong Kong, 23 October 2024\nAs at the date of this announcement, HKEX’s Board of Directors comprises 12 Independent\nNon-executive Directors, namely Mr Carlson TONG (Chairman), Mr Nicholas Charles ALLEN,\nMr Apurv BAGRI, Mr CHAN Kin Por, Mr CHEAH Cheng Hye, Ms CHEUNG Ming Ming, Anna,\nMrs CHOW WOO Mo Fong, Susan, Ms LEUNG Nisa Bernice Wing-Yu, Mr LEUNG Pak Hon, Hugo,\nMr YAM Chi Kwong, Joseph, Mr YAN King Shun, Peter and Mr ZHANG Yichen, and one Executive\nDirector, Ms CHAN Yiting, Bonnie, who is also the Chief Executive of HKEX.\n26"
