Diluted\nearnings per share (“EPS”) was $1.37, compared with $1.13 in the third quarter of 2023, as higher net interest income and a lower provision for\ncredit losses were partially offset by lower noninterest income.\n• Net interest income increased $35 million, or 6%, relative to the prior year period, as higher earning asset yields were partially offset by\nhigher funding costs. Net interest income was also impacted by growth in average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was\n3.03%, compared with 2.93%.\n◦ Average interest-earning assets increased $2.2 billion, or 3%, as growth in average money market investments and average loans\nand leases, was partially offset by a decline in average securities.\n◦ Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.3 billion, or 8%, driven by increases in average interest-bearing deposits and\naverage borrowed funds.\n◦ Total loans and leases increased $2.0 billion, or 3%, primarily due to growth in the consumer 1-4 family residential mortgage\nand commercial and industrial loan portfolios.\n◦ Total deposits increased $319 million, as an increase in interest-bearing deposits was partially offset by a decrease in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits. Customer deposits (excluding brokered deposits) increased $1.7 billion, or 2%, to $70.5\nbillion, compared with $68.8 billion.\n• The provision for credit losses was $13 million, compared with $41 million in the prior year period.\n• Customer-related noninterest income increased $4 million, or 3%, driven largely by increases in capital markets fees and commercial\naccount fees, partially offset by a decline in loan-related fees and income. Decreases in noncustomer-related noninterest income were\nprimarily due to credit valuation adjustments on client-related interest rate swaps, and a decline in dividends on Federal Home Loan\nBank (“FHLB”) stock.\n• Noninterest expense increased $6 million, or 1%. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased primarily due to a decline in\ncapitalized salaries related to reduced software development activities, and technology, telecom, and information processing expense\nincreased primarily due to higher application software, license, and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by\ndecreases in other expenses, including professional and legal services and occupancy and equipment expenses.\n• Net loan and lease charge-offs totaled $3 million, or 0.02%, of average loans and leases, compared with $14 million, or 0.10%, in the\nprior year quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) to total loans and leases was 1.25%, compared with 1.30%.\n• Nonperforming assets totaled $368 million, or 0.62%, of total loans and leases and other real estate owned, compared with $219 million,\nor 0.38%. The increase was primarily due to a small number of loans in the commercial and industrial and term commercial real estate\n(“CRE”) portfolios.\n• Classified loans totaled $2.1 billion, or 3.55%, of total loans and leases, compared with $769 million, or 1.35%. The increase was\nprimarily in the multifamily CRE loan portfolio, largely due to a change in approach to risk grading that places more emphasis on\ncurrent cash flow, which is the primary source of repayment, and less emphasis on the adequacy of collateral values and the strength of\nguarantors and sponsors. The increase in classified loans was also attributable to weaker performance, particularly for 2021 and 2022\nconstruction loan vintages, as borrowers missed projections due to lower-than-anticipated leasing, rent concessions, elevated costs, and\nhigher interest rates.\n• Total borrowed funds, consisting primarily of secured borrowings, decreased $1.4 billion, or 29%, from the prior year quarter, primarily\ndue to a decrease in security repurchase agreements.\n6\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change\nInterest and fees on loans 1 $ 899 $ 831 $ 68 8 % $ 2,641 $ 2,348 $ 293 12 %\nInterest on money market investments 67 35 32 91 170 140 30 21\nInterest on securities 138 144 (6) (4) 420 419 1 —\nTotal interest income 1,104 1,010 94 9 3,231 2,907 324 11\nInterest on deposits 403 366 37 10 1,169 668 501 75\nInterest on short- and long-term\n81 59 22 37 259 384 (125) (33)\nborrowings\nTotal interest expense 484 425 59 14 1,428 1,052 376 36\nNet interest income $ 620 $ 585 $ 35 6 $ 1,803 $ 1,855 $ (52) (3)\nAverage interest-earning assets $ 82,894 $ 80,678 $ 2,216 3 % $ 82,204 $ 82,325 $ (121) — %\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities $ 56,628 $ 52,312 $ 4,316 8 $ 55,854 $ 51,271 $ 4,583 9\nbps bps\nYield on interest-earning assets 2 5.35 % 5.02 % 33 5.30 % 4.77 % 53\nRate paid on total deposits and interest-\n2.36 % 2.10 % 26 2.34 % 1.75 % 59\nbearing liabilities 2\nCost of total deposits 2 2.14 % 1.92 % 22 2.10 % 1.24 % 86\nNet interest margin 2 3.03 % 2.93 % 10 2.98 % 3.06 % (8)\n1 Includes interest income recoveries of $1 million for both the three months ended, and $5 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively.\n2 Taxable-equivalent rates used where applicable.\nNet interest income accounted for approximately 78% and 76% of our net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) during the third\nquarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and increased $35 million, or 6%, relative to the prior year quarter, as the repricing of interest-earning\nassets outpaced the increase in funding costs. Net interest income was also impacted by growth in average interest-earning assets. The NIM was\n3.03%, compared with 2.93%.\nThe yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.35% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 33 basis points (“bps”), reflecting higher\ninterest rates and a favorable mix change to higher yielding assets, as average securities decreased, and average loans and average money market\ninvestments increased. The yield on average loans and leases increased 31 bps to 6.15%, and the yield on average securities increased 13 bps to\n2.86% in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was 2.36%, compared with 2.10% in the prior year quarter, and the cost of total\ndeposits was 2.14%, compared with 1.92%, reflecting the higher interest rate environment and reduced noninterest-bearing deposits.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $2.2 billion, or 3% from the prior year quarter, as growth of $2.3 billion in average money market\ninvestments and $1.7 billion in average loans and leases, was partially offset by a decline of $1.8 billion in average securities. The decrease in\naverage securities was primarily due to principal reductions.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.3 billion, or 8%, from the prior year quarter, driven by increases of $2.5 billion in average\ninterest-bearing deposits, primarily due to customer deposit growth, and $1.8 billion in average borrowed funds, primarily due to increased short-\nterm borrowings.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $52 million, or 3%, relative to the same prior year period, as\nhigher funding costs more than offset higher earning asset yields.\n7\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following charts further illustrate the changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities:\nAverage loans and leases increased $1.7 billion, or 3%, to $58.7 billion, primarily due to growth in average consumer and commercial real estate\nloans. Average securities decreased $1.8 billion, or 9%, to $19.4 billion, primarily due to principal reductions.\nAverage deposits decreased $0.7 billion, or 1%, to $75.0 billion at an average cost of 2.14%, from $75.7 billion at an average cost of 1.92% in\nthe third quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $3.2 billion, or 11%, relative to the prior year quarter, and were\nrelatively flat compared with the ending balance at June 30, 2024, reflecting stabilization during the current quarter. Average noninterest-bearing\ndeposits decreased to 33% of total deposits, compared with 37% during the same prior year period.\n8\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAverage borrowed funds, consisting primarily of secured borrowings, increased $1.8 billion, or 39%, to $6.3 billion, primarily due to increased\nshort-term borrowings, including advances under the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”).\nFor more information on our investment securities portfolio and borrowed funds and how we manage liquidity risk, refer to the “Investment\nSecurities Portfolio” section on page 17 and the “Liquidity Risk Management” section on page 34.

BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) is the combination of both the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) and the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments (“RULC”). The ALLL represents the estimated current expected credit losses related to the loan and lease\nportfolio as of the balance sheet date. The RULC represents the estimated reserve for current expected credit losses associated with off-balance\nsheet commitments. Changes in the ALLL and RULC, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as the provision for loan and lease losses\nand the provision for unfunded lending commitments, respectively, on the consolidated statement of income. The ACL for debt securities is\nestimated separately from loans and is included in “Investment securities” on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe ACL was $736 million at September 30, 2024, and was relatively flat compared with $738 million at September 30, 2023. The slight\ndecrease in the ACL primarily reflects improvements in economic forecasts and declines in unfunded lending commitments related to\nconstruction lending, partially offset by increases associated with declines in credit quality, incremental reserves associated with portfolio-\nspecific risks including CRE, average loan growth of $1.7 billion, and changes in our loan portfolio composition. The ratio of ACL to total loans\nand leases was 1.25% at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.30% at September 30, 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses, which is the combination of both the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending\ncommitments, was $13 million, compared with $41 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for securities losses was less than $1\nmillion during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.\n12\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe bar chart above illustrates the broad categories of change in the ACL from the prior year period. To estimate current expected losses, we use\neconometric loss models that include multiple economic scenarios that reflect optimistic, baseline, and stressed economic conditions. The results\nderived using these economic scenarios are weighted to produce the credit loss estimate. Management may adjust the weights to reflect their\nassessment of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The second bar represents changes in these economic forecasts and\ncurrent economic conditions, including management's judgment of the weighting of the economic forecasts during the current quarter. These\nchanges contributed to a $199 million decrease in the ACL from the prior year quarter.\nThe third bar represents changes in credit quality factors and includes risk grade migration, portfolio-specific risks, and specific reserves against\nloans, which, when combined, contributed to a $163 million increase in the ACL, driven largely by declines in credit quality and an increased\nfocus on certain portfolio-specific risks, including commercial real estate.\nThe fourth bar represents changes in our loan portfolio composition, including changes in loan balances and mix, the aging of the portfolio, and\nother qualitative risk factors; all of which contributed to a $34 million increase in the ACL.\nSee “Credit Risk Management” on page 21 and Note 6 in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on how we determine the appropriate level\nof the ALLL and the RULC.\n13\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income represents revenue earned from products and services that generally have no associated interest rate or yield and is classified\nas either customer-related or noncustomer-related. Customer-related noninterest income excludes items such as securities gains and losses,\ndividends, insurance-related income, and mark-to-market adjustments on certain derivatives.\nNoninterest income accounted for approximately 22% and 24% of our net revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) during the third\nquarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and decreased $8 million, or 4%, relative to the prior year quarter. The following schedule presents a\ncomparison of the major components of noninterest income:\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change\nCommercial account fees $ 46 $ 43 $ 3 7 % $ 135 $ 131 $ 4 3 %\nCard fees 24 26 (2) (8) 72 75 (3) (4)\nRetail and business banking fees 18 17 1 6 50 49 1 2\nLoan-related fees and income 17 23 (6) (26) 50 63 (13) (21)\nCapital markets fees 28 18 10 56 73 62 11 18\nWealth management fees 14 15 (1) (7) 44 44 — —\nOther customer-related fees 14 15 (1) (7) 42 46 (4) (9)\nCustomer-related noninterest income 161 157 4 3 466 470 (4) (1)\nFair value and nonhedge derivative income (3) 7 (10) NM (3) 5 (8) NM\nDividends and other income (loss) 5 12 (7) (58) 33 49 (16) (33)\nSecurities gains (losses), net 9 4 5 NM 11 5 6 NM\nNoncustomer-related noninterest income 11 23 (12) (52) 41 59 (18) (31)\nTotal noninterest income $ 172 $ 180 $ (8) (4) $ 507 $ 529 $ (22) (4)\nCustomer-related Noninterest Income\nCustomer-related noninterest income increased $4 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year period. Capital markets fees increased $10\nmillion, largely due to increased swap fees, loan syndication fees, and expanded real estate capital markets activity, and commercial account fees\nincreased $3 million. These increases were partially offset by a $6 million decrease in loan-related fees and income, primarily due to higher gains\non loan sales in the prior year period and a decline in loan servicing income resulting from the sale of associated mortgage servicing rights in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nNoncustomer-related Noninterest Income\nNoncustomer-related noninterest income decreased $12 million from the prior year quarter. Fair value and nonhedge derivative income\ndecreased $10 million, primarily due to credit valuation adjustments on client-related interest rate swaps, and dividends and other income\ndecreased $7 million, primarily due to a decline in dividends on FHLB stock. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5 million\nin net securities gains, largely due to valuation adjustments in our Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investment portfolio.\n14\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following schedule presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense:\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 317 $ 311 $ 6 2 % $ 966 $ 974 $ (8) (1)%\nTechnology, telecom, and information processing 66 62 4 6 194 175 19 11\nOccupancy and equipment, net 40 42 (2) (5) 119 122 (3) (2)\nProfessional and legal services 14 16 (2) (13) 47 45 2 4\nMarketing and business development 12 10 2 20 35 35 — —\nDeposit insurance and regulatory expense 19 20 (1) (5) 74 60 14 23\nCredit-related expense 6 6 — — 19 19 — —\nOther real estate expense, net — — — NM (1) — (1) NM\nOther 28 29 (1) (3) 84 86 (2) (2)\nTotal noninterest expense $ 502 $ 496 $ 6 1 $ 1,537 $ 1,516 $ 21 1\nAdjusted noninterest expense (non-GAAP) $ 499 $ 493 $ 6 1 % $ 1,516 $ 1,496 $ 20 1 %\nTotal noninterest expense increased $6 million, or 1%, relative to the prior year quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $6\nmillion, or 2%, primarily due to a decline in capitalized salaries related to reduced software development activities, as well as higher benefits\naccruals, and an additional business day during the current quarter. Technology, telecom, and information processing expense increased $4\nmillion, or 6%, primarily due to increases in application software, license, and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by\ndecreases in other expenses including professional and legal services associated with reduced technology-related consulting services and\noccupancy and equipment expenses.\nAdjusted noninterest expense increased $6 million, or 1%. The efficiency ratio was 62.5%, compared with 64.4%, due to an increase in adjusted\ntaxable-equivalent revenue. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see page 38.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense increased $21 million, or 1%, relative to the same prior year period.\nTechnology, telecom, and information processing expense increased $19 million, or 11%, primarily due to increases in software amortization\nexpenses associated with the replacement of substantially all of our in-scope core loan and deposit banking systems. Deposit insurance and\nregulatory expense increased $14 million, or 23%, driven largely by a $13 million accrual associated with an updated special assessment\nestimate by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) during the first quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a\ndecrease of $8 million, or 1%, in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily due to higher severance expense and incentive compensation\naccruals in the prior year period.\nTechnology Spend\nConsistent with our strategic objectives, we invest in technologies that will make us more efficient and enable us to remain competitive. We\ngenerally consider these investments as technology spend, which represents expenditures associated with technology-related investments,\noperations, systems, and infrastructure, and includes current period expenses presented on the consolidated statement of income, as well as\ncapitalized investments, net of related amortization and depreciation, presented on the consolidated balance sheet. Technology spend is reported\nas a combination of the following:\n• Technology, telecom, and information processing expense — includes expenses related to application software, licensing, and\nmaintenance; related amortization; telecommunications; and data processing;\n15\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n• Other technology-related expense — includes related noncapitalized salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, and\nprofessional and legal services; and\n• Technology investments — includes capitalized technology infrastructure equipment, hardware, and purchased or internally developed\nsoftware, less related amortization or depreciation.\nThe following schedule presents the composition of our technology spend:\nTECHNOLOGY SPEND\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 change change 2024 2023 change change\nTechnology, telecom, and information processing\n$ 66 $ 62 $ 4 6 % $ 194 $ 175 $ 19 11 %\nexpense\nOther technology-related expense 62 59 3 5 188 169 19 11\nTechnology investments 7 22 (15) (68) 26 71 (45) (63)\nLess: related amortization and depreciation (19) (21) 2 (10) (59) (51) (8) 16\nTotal technology spend $ 116 $ 122 $ (6) (5) $ 349 $ 364 $ (15) (4)\nTotal technology spend decreased $6 million, or 5%, relative to the prior year quarter, as the aforementioned increase in technology, telecom, and\ninformation processing expense and an increase in other technology-related expense was more than offset by a decrease in certain technology\ninvestments, as the final phase of our multi-year project to replace substantially all of our in-scope core loan and deposit banking systems was\ncompleted in July 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following schedule summarizes the income tax expense and effective tax rates for the periods presented:\nINCOME TAXES\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome before income taxes $ 277 $ 228 $ 742 $ 736\nIncome tax expense 63 53 174 182\nEffective tax rate 22.7 % 23.2 % 23.5 % 24.7 %\nThe effective tax rate was 22.7% and 23.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 12 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information about the factors that impacted the income tax rates, as well as information about\ndeferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nPreferred stock dividends totaled $10 million and $7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due\nto changes in the timing and rates of dividend payments for certain series of preferred stock.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nInterest-Earning Assets\nInterest-earning assets have associated interest rates or yields, and generally consist of loans and leases, securities, and money market\ninvestments. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets. For more information regarding the average\nbalances, associated revenue generated, and the respective yields of our interest-earning assets, see the Consolidated Average Balance Sheet on\npage 10.\n16\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nWe invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to generate interest income. We primarily own securities that can\nreadily provide us cash and liquidity through secured borrowing agreements without the need to sell the securities. Our fixed-rate securities\nportfolio helps balance the inherent interest rate mismatch between loans and deposits and protects the economic value of shareholders’ equity.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated duration of our investment securities portfolio, which measures price\nsensitivity to interest rate changes, was 3.6 percent.\nFor information about our borrowing capacity associated with our investment securities portfolio and how we manage our liquidity risk, refer to\nthe “Liquidity Risk Management” section on page 34.

Total taxable-equivalent premium amortization for our total investment securities portfolio was $17 million for the third\nquarter of 2024, compared with $20 million for the same prior year period.\nRefer to the “Interest Rate Risk Management” section on page 31, the “Capital Management” section on page 35, and Note 5 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more discussion regarding our investment securities portfolio, swaps, and related unrealized gains and\nlosses.\n17\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMunicipal Investments and Extensions of Credit\nWe support our communities by providing products and services to state and local governments (“municipalities”), including deposit services,\nloans, and investment banking services. We also invest in securities issued by municipalities. Our municipal lending products generally include\nloans in which the debt service is repaid from general funds or pledged revenues of the municipal entity, or to private commercial entities or\n501(c)(3) not-for-profit entities utilizing a pass-through municipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment.\nThe following schedule summarizes our total investments and extensions of credit to municipalities:\nMUNICIPAL INVESTMENTS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nLoans and leases $ 4,270 $ 4,302\nUnfunded lending commitments 438 231\nTrading securities 68 48\nAvailable-for-sale securities 1,189 1,318\nHeld-to-maturity securities 324 354\nTotal $ 6,289 $ 6,253\nOur municipal loans and securities are primarily associated with municipalities located within our geographic footprint. The municipal loan and\nlease portfolio is primarily secured by general obligations of municipal entities, real estate, revenue pledges, or equipment. At September 30,\n2024, we had a small number of municipal loans on nonaccrual totaling $11 million; we had no municipal loans on nonaccrual at December 31,\n2023. These loans were to private commercial entities utilizing a pass-through municipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment.\nMunicipal securities are internally graded, similar to loans, using risk-grading systems which vary based on the size and type of credit risk\nexposure. The internal risk grades assigned to our municipal securities follow our definitions of Pass, Special Mention, and Substandard, which\nare consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. At September 30, 2024, all municipal securities were graded as Pass.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans\nand securities.\nLoan and Lease Portfolio\nWe provide a wide range of lending products to commercial customers, generally small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as other products\nsecured by commercial real estate.

See\n“Liquidity Risk Management” on page 34 for additional information on liquidity, including the ratio of available liquidity to uninsured deposits.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of our operations and is a key determinant of our overall performance. We employ various strategies to\nprudently manage the risks to which our operations are exposed, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic and\nbusiness risk, operational risk, technology risk,\n20\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\ncybersecurity risk, capital/financial reporting risk, legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk), and reputational risk. These risks are\noverseen by various management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. For a more comprehensive discussion of\nthese risks, see “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-\nrelated contract. Credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities, as well as from off-balance sheet credit instruments. Credit policies,\ncredit risk management, and credit examination functions inform and support the oversight of credit risk. Our credit policies emphasize strong\nunderwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to\nmitigate potential losses. These formal credit policies and procedures provide us with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for\nsound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level.\nOur business activity is conducted primarily within the geographic footprint of our banking affiliates. We strive to avoid the risk of undue\nconcentrations of credit in any particular industry, collateral type, location, or with any individual customer or counterparty. For a more\ncomprehensive discussion of our credit risk management, see “Credit Risk Management” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nU.S. Government Agency Guaranteed Loans\nWe participate in various guaranteed lending programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies, such as the Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”), Federal Housing Authority, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Export-Import Bank of the U.S., and the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture. At September 30, 2024, $548 million of related loans were guaranteed, primarily by the SBA.

Commercial loans are typically structured as seasonal, term, working capital, or bridge loans in the form of\nrevolving and non-revolving lines of credit, amortizing term loans, guidance facilities, and single-payment loans. These loans include covenants\nrequiring borrowers to provide regular financial reporting to measure leverage, debt service coverage, and liquidity. At\n21\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSeptember 30, 2024, approximately 70% of our commercial lending portfolio was variable rate, and approximately 10% of these variable-rate\nloans were swapped with our customers to a fixed rate.\nUnderwriting of commercial loans is primarily based on analyses of management, financial performance, industry, sponsorship (if applicable),\nand transaction structure, with credit enhancements typically provided by collateral and guarantees from the owners or sponsors. Prospective\ncash flows are subjected to various downside scenario analyses, including revenue decline, margin compression, and interest rate movements.\nThe following schedule presents the geography distribution of our commercial lending portfolio.

Typical\nterm CRE loan structures include annually tested operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage,\ndebt yield, or loan-to-value (“LTV”) tests. Construction and land development loans generally mature in 18 to 36 months and contain full or\npartial recourse guarantee structures with one- to five-year extension options or roll-to-perm options that often result in term loans. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, approximately 86% of our CRE loan portfolio was variable-rate, and approximately 21% of these variable-rate loans were\nswapped with our customers to a fixed rate.\nUnderwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with significant consideration given to the\ncreditworthiness and experience of the sponsor. We generally require that the owner’s equity be included prior to any advances. Remargining\nrequirements (required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along\nwith guarantees of the sponsor.\nReal estate appraisals are performed in accordance with regulatory guidelines. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used\nor internal evaluations are performed. An appraisal is ordered and reviewed prior to loan closing, and a new appraisal or evaluation is generally\nordered when market conditions indicate a potential decline in the value of the collateral, or when the loan is either modified, renewed, or\ndeteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness. CRE LTVs are calculated by dividing the outstanding loan balance by the estimated collateral\nvalue from the most current appraisal. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average LTV ratio for our term CRE portfolio was less than 60%.\nFor a more comprehensive discussion of CRE loans and our underwriting, see “Commercial Real Estate Loans” in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Approximately 33% of the multifamily CRE loan portfolio is scheduled to mature in the next\n12 months. We believe that most of these borrowers will be able to refinance at maturity through the Bank, or other lenders, as a result of the\ncash flows from the properties, acceptable LTVs, equity levels, and guarantor support.

At September 30, 2024, our 1-4 family residential\nmortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.5 billion, or 65%, of our total consumer loan portfolio, compared with $8.4 billion, or 61%, at December 31,\n2023. Approximately 91% and 93% of our 1-4 family residential mortgage loan portfolio was variable-rate for the same respective time periods.\nWe generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixed-rate loans to third parties, including Federal National\nMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet\ncertain underwriting and collateral documentation standards.\nHome Equity Credit Lines\nWe also originate home equity credit lines (“HECLs”). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our HECL portfolio totaled $3.5 billion\nand $3.4 billion, respectively. Approximately 37% and 39% of our HECLs were secured by first liens for the same respective time periods.\nAt September 30, 2024, loans representing less than 1% of the outstanding balance in the HECL portfolio were estimated to have combined loan-\nto-value (“CLTV”) ratios above 100%. An estimated CLTV ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated\ncurrent collateral value. At origination, underwriting standards for the HECL portfolio generally include a maximum 80% CLTV with a Fair\nIsaac Corporation (“FICO”) credit score greater than 700.\nApproximately 92% of our HECL portfolio is still in the draw period, and about 21% of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the\nnext five years. We believe the risk of loss and borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the effect of significant\ninterest rate changes is low, given the rate shock analysis performed at origination. The ratio of HECL net charge-offs (recoveries) for the trailing\ntwelve months to average balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was (0.01)% and 0.05%, respectively.

The increase was primarily in the multifamily CRE loan portfolio, largely due to a change in approach to risk grading that\nplaces more emphasis on current cash flow, which is the primary source of repayment, and less emphasis on the adequacy of collateral values\nand the strength of guarantors and sponsors. The increase in classified loans was also attributable to weaker performance, particularly for 2021\nand 2022 construction loan vintages, as borrowers missed projections due to lower-than-anticipated leasing, rent concessions, elevated costs, and\nhigher interest rates. Our CRE loan portfolio continues to benefit from strong underwriting, supported by high borrower equity and guarantor\nsupport.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL, which consists of the ALLL and the RULC, represents our estimate of current expected credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date.\nWe estimate current expected credit losses, which include considerations of historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and standard\neconomic forecasts, all of which inform the quantitative portion of our ACL. We also consider qualitative and environmental factors that may\nindicate losses may differ from levels estimated by our quantitative models. The impact of these factors on our ACL may change from quarter to\nquarter.\nDuring recent quarters, the qualitative portion of the ACL has increased primarily due to (1) economic uncertainty, which caused us to increase\nthe weights on recessionary economic forecasts, and (2) portfolio-specific risks, which caused us to use stressed economic forecasts for certain\nportfolios, particularly CRE.\n29\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following schedule presents the changes in the ACL and certain credit-related metrics:\nCHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nNine Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Dollar amounts in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nLoans and leases outstanding $ 58,884 $ 57,779 $ 56,893\nAverage loans and leases outstanding:\nCommercial 30,553 30,519 30,620\nCommercial real estate 13,538 13,023 12,942\nConsumer 14,198 13,198 13,041\nTotal average loans and leases outstanding $ 58,289 $ 56,740 $ 56,603\nAllowance for loan and lease losses:\nBalance at beginning of period $ 684 $ 572 $ 572\nProvision for loan losses 34 148 136\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial 30 45 35\nCommercial real estate 11 3 3\nConsumer 9 14 11\nTotal 50 62 49\nRecoveries:\nCommercial 19 20 17\nCommercial real estate 3 — —\nConsumer 4 6 5\nTotal 26 26 22\nNet loan and lease charge-offs 24 36 27\nBalance at end of period $ 694 $ 684 $ 681\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments:\nBalance at beginning of period $ 45 $ 61 $ 61\nProvision for unfunded lending commitments (3) (16) (4)\nBalance at end of period $ 42 $ 45 $ 57\nTotal allowance for credit losses:\nAllowance for loan and lease losses $ 694 $ 684 $ 681\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments 42 45 57\nTotal allowance for credit losses $ 736 $ 729 $ 738\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to net loans and leases, at period end 1.25 % 1.26 % 1.30 %\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans, at period end 203 % 328 % 371 %\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans and accruing loans\npast due 90 days or more, at period end 199 % 324 % 343 %\nRatio of total net charge-offs to average loans and leases 1 0.05 % 0.06 % 0.06 %\nRatio of commercial net charge-offs to average commercial loans 1 0.05 % 0.08 % 0.08 %\nRatio of commercial real estate net charge-offs to average commercial real\nestate loans 1 0.08 % 0.02 % 0.03 %\nRatio of consumer net charge-offs to average consumer loans 1 0.05 % 0.06 % 0.06 %\n1 Ratios are annualized for the periods presented except for the period representing the full twelve months.\nSee “The Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses” section on page 12 for more discussion on changes in the ACL, and see Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the ACL and credit trends experienced in each portfolio\nsegment.\n30\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInterest Rate and Market Risk Management\nInterest rate and market risk is the risk of losses to current or future earnings and capital from changes in interest rates and other market\nconditions. Because we engage in transactions involving various financial products, we are exposed to interest rate and market risk. For a more\ncomprehensive discussion of our interest rate and market risk management, see “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” in our 2023 Form\n10-K.\nWe strive to position the Bank for interest rate changes and manage the balance sheet sensitivity to reduce the volatility of both net interest\nincome and economic value of equity (“EVE”). With the recent higher interest rate environment, customer deposit behavior has deviated from\nthe trends observed during the relatively low interest rate period over the prior 15 years. As a result, customers have been more inclined to (1)\nmove deposits to nonbanking products, such as money market mutual funds, that offer higher interest rates, and (2) reduce their balances in\nnoninterest-bearing accounts. Observed changes in deposit behavior have been incorporated into our deposit models used in managing interest\nrate risk, giving more weight to the recently observed behavior, and increased both the deposit beta for interest-bearing products and the\npercentage of noninterest-bearing deposits assumed to migrate to interest-bearing products. Changes to models are independently reviewed by\nour Model Risk Management function.\nWe generally have granular deposit funding, and much of this funding is in the form of demand deposits with no maturity, which contractually\ncan be withdrawn at any time. Rather than using contractual maturities, our interest rate risk model uses dynamically modeled behavioral\nassumptions based on historical behavior and future projections. Because many deposits from household and business accounts have proven to\nbe stable over time and less sensitive to rate changes, their duration is generally longer than the duration of our loan portfolio. As such, we have\nhistorically been “asset-sensitive” — meaning that our assets are expected to reprice faster or more significantly than our liabilities. We regularly\nuse interest rate swaps, investment in fixed-rate securities, and funding strategies to manage our interest rate risk. These strategies collectively\nhave muted the expected sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Asset sensitivity measures depend upon the assumptions\nwe use for deposit runoff and repricing behavior. Our models are particularly sensitive to these assumptions about the rate of such behavior.\nWe also assume a correlation, referred to as a “deposit beta,” with respect to interest-bearing deposits, wherein the rates paid to customers\nchange at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates. Generally, certificates of deposit are assumed to\nhave a high correlation, while interest-bearing checking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation.\nThe following schedule presents deposit duration assumptions discussed previously:\nDEPOSIT ASSUMPTIONS\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEffective Effective Effective Effective Effective Effective\nduration duration duration duration duration duration\nProduct (-200 bps) (unchanged) (+200 bps) (-200 bps) (unchanged) (+200 bps)\nDemand deposits 4.4% 3.1% 2.8% 4.0% 3.5% 3.2%\nMoney market 3.2% 1.5% 1.4% 3.0% 1.5% 1.4%\nSavings and interest-bearing checking 2.5% 2.1% 1.8% 2.7% 2.2% 1.9%\nThe effective duration of the deposits increases as market rates decline due to the inability to reprice as deposits approach their floor.\nAs noted previously, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The following schedule presents derivatives that are designated in\nqualifying hedging relationships at September 30, 2024. Included are the average outstanding derivative notional amounts for each period\npresented and the weighted average fixed-rate paid or received for each category of cash flow and fair value hedge. See Note 7 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of these hedging relationships on interest income and\nexpense.\n31\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDERIVATIVES DESIGNATED IN QUALIFYING HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\n2024 2025 2026\nFourth First Second Third Fourth First Second Third 4Q27 -\n(Dollar amounts in millions) Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter 4Q26 - 1Q27 3Q28\nCash flow hedges\nCash flow hedges of assets 1\nAverage outstanding notional $ 350 $ 350 $ 350 $ 350 $ 300 $ 133 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 $ —\nWeighted-average fixed-rate\nreceived 2.34 % 2.34 % 2.34 % 2.34 % 2.13 % 1.67 % 1.65 % 1.65 % 1.65 % — %\nCash flow hedges of liabilities 2\nAverage outstanding notional $ 500 $ 500 $ 500 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nWeighted-average fixed-rate\npaid 3.67 % 3.67 % 3.67 % — % — % — % — % — % — % — %\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033\nFair value hedges\nFair value hedges of assets 3\nAverage outstanding notional $ 4,468 $ 4,558 $ 4,562 $ 4,558 $ 2,428 $ 1,049 $ 1,044 $ 1,037 $ 1,001 $ 973\nWeighted-average fixed-rate\npaid 3.23 % 3.21 % 3.21 % 3.21 % 2.47 % 1.84 % 1.83 % 1.83 % 1.83 % 1.82 %\n1 Cash flow hedges of assets consist of receive-fixed swaps hedging pools of floating-rate loans. The longest dated cash flow hedge matures in February 2027. Amounts\nfor 2027 have not been prorated to reflect this hedge maturing during the period.\n2 Cash flow hedges of liabilities consist of a pay-fixed swap hedging rolling FHLB advances. This swap matures in May 2025.\n3 Fair value asset hedges consist of pay-fixed swaps hedging fixed-rate AFS securities and fixed-rate commercial loans, as further discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Increasing notional amounts in 2025 are due to forward starting swaps.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $117 million of net losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) related to\nterminated cash flow hedges. Amounts deferred in AOCI from terminated cash flow hedges will be amortized into interest income on a straight-\nline basis through the original maturity dates of the hedges as long as the hedged forecasted transactions continue to be expected to occur. For\nmore information on amounts deferred in AOCI related to terminated cash flow hedges, see “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” in our\n2023 Form 10-K.\nEarnings at Risk (EaR) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE)\nIncorporating our deposit assumptions and the impact of derivatives in qualifying hedging relationships previously discussed, the following\nschedule presents earnings at risk (“EaR”), or the percentage change in 12-month forward-looking net interest income, and our estimated\npercentage change in EVE. Both EaR and EVE are based on a static balance sheet size under instantaneous parallel interest rate changes ranging\nfrom -200 bps to +200 bps. These measures highlight the sensitivity to changes in interest rates across various scenarios; the outcomes are not\nintended to be forecasts of expected net interest income.\nINCOME SIMULATION – CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND CHANGE IN ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nParallel shift in rates (in bps) 1 Parallel shift in rates (in bps) 1\nRepricing scenario -200 -100 0 +100 +200 -200 -100 0 +100 +200\nEarnings at Risk\n(5.7)% (2.7)% — % 2.5 % 5.1 % (5.6)% (2.5)% — % 2.4 % 4.9 %\n(EaR)\nEconomic Value of Equity\n8.7 % 2.9 % — % (1.9)% (4.4)% 6.6 % 2.8 % — % (1.4)% (3.3)%\n(EVE)\n1 Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shifts.\n32\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe asset sensitivity, as measured by EaR, increased during the first nine months of 2024, due to securities redemptions, swap maturities, and\nassumption changes that reduced the projected runoff of noninterest-bearing deposits. Under our current deposit assumptions, interest rate risk\nremains within policy limits. For interest-bearing deposits with indeterminable maturities, the weighted average modeled beta is 55%.\nPrepayment assumptions are an important factor in how we manage interest rate risk. Certain assets in our portfolio, such as 1-4 family\nresidential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, can be prepaid at any time by the borrower, which may significantly affect our expected\ncash flows. At September 30, 2024, lifetime prepayment speeds were estimated to be 15.8% for loans, which reflects an acceleration of\nprepayments upon rate reset for adjustable rate loans, and 7.1% for mortgage-backed securities.\nThe EaR analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of benchmark interest rates. In a non-parallel rate scenario, where\nshort-term rates decline 200 bps, but long-term rates are unchanged, the EaR is comparable to the parallel rate scenario of similar rate shock.\nIf interest rates were to follow the rate path implied by the forward curve at September 30, 2024, modeled net interest income would increase in\nthe third quarter of 2025 by an additional 1.4%, when compared to the third quarter of 2024. For a -100 bps and +100 bps parallel interest rate\nshock to the implied forward rate path, the cumulative net interest income sensitivity would be between (0.8)% and 3.1%, respectively.\nOur focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of our asset-liability management posture. At September 30,\n2024, $27.4 billion of our commercial and CRE loans were scheduled to reprice in the next six months. For these variable-rate loans, we have\nexecuted $350 million of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024, we also had $4.0 billion of\nvariable-rate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months. The impact on asset sensitivity from commercial or consumer loans\nwith floors has become insignificant as rates have risen. See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation regarding derivative instruments.\nFixed Income\nWe are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value. This includes market risk for trading securities and for interest rate swaps used to\nhedge interest rate risk. We underwrite municipal and corporate securities. We also trade municipal, agency, and treasury securities. This\nunderwriting and trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed-income securities.\nChanges in the fair value of AFS securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in AOCI for each financial\nreporting period. For more discussion regarding investment securities and AOCI, see the “Capital Management” section on page 35. See also\nNote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the accounting for investment securities.\nEquity Investments\nThrough our equity investment activities, we own equity securities that are publicly traded. In addition, we own equity securities in\ngovernmental entities and companies, e.g., Federal Reserve (“FRB”) and the FHLB, that are not publicly traded. For more information regarding\nour equity investments, see “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nWe hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly pre-public companies, primarily through various SBIC venture capital funds as a\nstrategy to provide beneficial financing, growth, and expansion opportunities to diverse businesses generally in communities within our\ngeographic footprint. Our equity exposure to these investments was approximately $202 million and $190 million at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. On occasion, some of the companies within our SBIC investment may issue an initial public offering (“IPO”).\nIn this case, the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before we can liquidate the investment, which can introduce additional market risk.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation of our SBIC investments.\n33\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity refers to our ability to meet our cash, contractual, and collateral obligations, and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows\nwithout adversely impacting our operations or financial strength. We manage our liquidity to provide funds for our customers’ credit needs, our\nanticipated financial and contractual obligations, and other corporate activities. Sources of liquidity primarily include deposits, borrowings,\nequity, and paydowns of assets, such as loans and investment securities. For more information on our liquidity risk management practices, see\n“Liquidity Risk Management” in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nWe have pledged collateral to the FRB’s primary credit facility (or discount window) and to the BTFP, which provide additional contingent\nfunding sources outside the normal operating hours of the FHLB and the General Collateral Funding (“GCF”) program. The BTFP offered loans\nof up to one year in length to eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and government mortgage-backed securities,\nand other qualifying assets as collateral. The availability of advances under the program ended in mid-March 2024.\nFor the first nine months of 2024, the primary sources of cash came from a decrease in investment securities, an increase in deposits, and net\ncash provided by operating activities. Uses of cash during the same period primarily included a decrease in short-term borrowings, an increase in\nloans and leases, and dividends paid on common and preferred stock. Cash payments for interest reflected in operating expenses were\n$1.4 billion and $913 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe FHLB and FRB have been, and continue to be, a significant source of back-up liquidity and funding. We are a member of the FHLB of Des\nMoines, which allows member banks to borrow against eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements. We are\nrequired to invest in FHLB and FRB stock to maintain our borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2024, our total investment in FHLB and FRB\nstock was $56 million and $65 million, respectively, compared with $79 million and $65 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, loans with a carrying value of $23.3 billion and $17.3 billion, compared with $24.8 billion and $11.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, were pledged at the FHLB and FRB, respectively, as collateral for current and potential borrowings.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investment securities with a carrying value of $18.6 billion and $20.5 billion, respectively, were\npledged as collateral for potential borrowings. For the same time periods, these pledged securities included $8.9 billion and $9.5 billion for\navailable use through the GCF and other repo programs, $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion to the FRB and FHLB, and $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion to\nsecure collateralized public and trust deposits, advances, and for other purposes.\nA large portion of these pledged assets are unencumbered, but are pledged to provide immediate access to contingency sources of funds.

At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had sources of liquidity that exceeded our uninsured deposits without the need to sell any investment securities.\nCredit Ratings\nGeneral financial market and economic conditions impact our access to, and cost of, external financing. Access to funding markets is also\ndirectly affected by the credit ratings we receive from various rating agencies. The ratings not only influence the costs associated with\nborrowings, but can also influence the sources of the borrowings. All of the credit rating agencies rate our debt at an investment-grade level.\nThe following schedule presents our credit ratings:\nCREDIT RATINGS\nas of October 31, 2024:\nLong-term\nissuer/senior Subordinated debt Short-term debt\nRating agency Outlook debt rating rating rating\nKroll Stable A- BBB+ K2\nS&P Negative BBB+ BBB NR\nFitch Stable BBB+ BBB F2\nMoody's Stable Baa2 NR P2\nCapital Management\nA strong capital position is vital to the achievement of our key corporate objectives, our continued profitability, and to promoting depositor and\ninvestor confidence. We seek to (1) maintain sufficient capital to support the current needs and growth of our businesses, consistent with our\nassessment of their potential to create value for shareholders, and (2) fulfill responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing\ncapital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock.\nWe utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and\nhypothetically stressed economic conditions, including the FRB’s supervisory severely adverse scenario. The timing and amount of capital\nactions are subject to various factors, including our financial performance, business needs, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and\nthe results of our internal stress testing, as well as Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) approval. Shares may be\nrepurchased occasionally in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.

The AOCI balance was a loss of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2024, and largely reflects a decline in the fair value of fixed-rate AFS\nsecurities as a result of changes in interest rates, and includes $1.9 billion ($1.4 billion after tax) of unrealized losses on the securities previously\ntransferred from AFS to held-to-maturity (“HTM”). When compared to December 31, 2023, AOCI improved $356 million, primarily due to $147\nmillion in unrealized loss amortization associated with the securities transferred from AFS to HTM, and $137 million primarily related to\npaydowns on AFS securities. AOCI was also impacted by a $72 million decrease in unrealized losses and other adjustments associated with\nderivative instruments used for risk management purposes.\nAbsent any sales or credit impairment of the AFS securities, the unrealized losses will not be recognized in earnings. We do not intend to sell any\nsecurities with unrealized losses. Although changes in AOCI are reflected in shareholders’ equity, they are currently excluded from regulatory\ncapital, and therefore do not impact our regulatory ratios.

As of October 1, 2024, we had $1.4 billion of retained net profits available for distribution.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we paid dividends on preferred stock of $10 million and dividends on common stock of $61 million, or $0.41\nper share. In November 2024, the Board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.43 per common share, payable on November 21, 2024 to\nshareholders of record on November 14, 2024.

At September 30, 2024, we exceeded all\ncapital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules. Based on our internal stress testing and other assessments of capital adequacy, we\nbelieve we hold capital sufficiently in excess of internal and regulatory requirements for well-capitalized banks.

The\nestimated CET1 capital ratio was 10.7%, compared with 10.2%. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 5.7%, compared with 4.4%,\nprimarily due to an increase in retained earnings and reduced unrealized losses in AOCI. For more information on non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, see page 38.\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, federal bank regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s\nfinalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly referred to as the “Basel III Endgame,” would\nsignificantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations, defined as those with total assets of $100 billion or more,\nand would potentially impact our current and future capital planning, including share repurchase activity. At September 30, 2024, we had $87.0\nbillion in total assets and do not currently qualify as a large banking organization. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal,\nas we expect it is more likely than not we would become subject to this proposal in the future, were it to be finalized in its current form.\nFederal bank regulators also issued proposals that would (1) expand a long-term debt requirement to all banks with total assets of $100 billion or\nmore, and (2) revise requirements for resolution planning. For more information about these regulatory proposals and their potential impact, see\n“Recent Regulatory Developments” in the Supervision and Regulation section of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n37\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis Form 10-Q presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures.\nThe adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following\nschedules. We consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful basis for period-to-period\ncomparisons. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our performance and financial position. We believe that presenting these\nnon-GAAP financial measures allows investors to assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by our management and the financial\nservices industry.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not necessarily comparable to similar financial measures that may be presented\nby other financial services companies. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they\nhave limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.\nTangible Common Equity and Related Measures\nTangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets and their related\namortization. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our use of shareholders’ equity and provide a basis for\nevaluating the performance of a business more consistently, whether acquired or developed internally.\nRETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (NON-GAAP)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2024 2023\nNet earnings applicable to common shareholders (GAAP) $ 204 $ 190 $ 168\nAdjustment, net of tax:\nAmortization of core deposit and other intangibles 1 1 1\n(a) $ 205 $ 191 $ 169\nNet earnings applicable to common shareholders, net of tax\nAverage common equity (GAAP) $ 5,738 $ 5,450 $ 4,938\nAverage goodwill and intangibles (1,054) (1,056) (1,061)\nAverage tangible common equity (non-GAAP) (b) $ 4,684 $ 4,394 $ 3,877\nNumber of days in quarter (c) 92 91 92\nNumber of days in year (d) 366 366 365\nReturn on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) 1 (a/b/c)*d 17.4 % 17.5 % 17.3 %\n1 Excluding the effect of AOCI from average tangible common equity would result in associated returns of 11.4%, 10.9%, and 9.9% for the periods presented,\nrespectively.\nTANGIBLE EQUITY RATIO, TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO, AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE (ALL NON-\nGAAP MEASURES)\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except shares and per share amounts) 2024 2024 2023\nTotal shareholders’ equity (GAAP) $ 6,385 $ 6,025 $ 5,315\nGoodwill and intangibles (1,053) (1,055) (1,060)\nTangible equity (non-GAAP) (a) 5,332 4,970 4,255\nPreferred stock (440) (440) (440)\nTangible common equity (non-GAAP) (b) $ 4,892 $ 4,530 $ 3,815\nTotal assets (GAAP) $ 87,032 $ 87,606 $ 87,269\nGoodwill and intangibles (1,053) (1,055) (1,060)\nTangible assets (non-GAAP) (c) $ 85,979 $ 86,551 $ 86,209\nCommon shares outstanding (in thousands) (d) 147,699 147,684 148,146\nTangible equity ratio (non-GAAP) (a/c) 6.2 % 5.7 % 4.9 %\nTangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP) (b/c) 5.7 % 5.2 % 4.4 %\nTangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) (b/d) $ 33.12 $ 30.67 $ 25.75\n38\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEfficiency Ratio and Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue\nThe efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expense relative to revenue. We believe the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding\nthe cost of generating revenue. We make adjustments to exclude certain items that are not generally expected to recur frequently, as identified in\nthe subsequent schedule, which we believe allows for more consistent comparability across periods. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a\nmeasure as to how we are managing our expenses. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) enables management and others to assess our\nability to generate capital. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows us to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and\ntax-exempt sources.\nEFFICIENCY RATIO (NON-GAAP) AND ADJUSTED PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (NON-GAAP)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended Year Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, December 31,\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 2023\nNoninterest expense (GAAP) (a) $ 502 $ 509 $ 496 $ 1,537 $ 1,516 $ 2,097\nAdjustments:\nSeverance costs 1 1 — 2 14 14\nOther real estate expense, net — (1) — (1) — —\nAmortization of core deposit and\n2 1 2 5 5 6\nother intangibles\nRestructuring costs — — 1 — 1 1\nSBIC investment success fee accrual — 1 — 1 — —\nFDIC special assessment — 1 — 14 — 90\nTotal adjustments (b) 3 3 3 21 20 111\nAdjusted noninterest expense (non-\n(c)=(a-b) $ 499 $ 506 $ 493 $ 1,516 $ 1,496 $ 1,986\nGAAP)\nNet interest income (GAAP) (d) $ 620 $ 597 $ 585 $ 1,803 $ 1,855 $ 2,438\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments (e) 12 11 11 33 31 41\nTaxable-equivalent net interest\n(f)=(d+e) 632 608 596 1,836 1,886 2,479\nincome (non-GAAP)\nNoninterest income (GAAP) g 172 179 180 507 529 677\nCombined income (non-GAAP) (h)=(f+g) 804 787 776 2,343 2,415 3,156\nAdjustments:\nFair value and nonhedge derivative\n(3) (1) 7 (3) 5 (4)\ngains (losses)\nSecurities gains (losses), net 9 4 4 11 5 4\nTotal adjustments (i) 6 3 11 8 10 —\nAdjusted taxable-equivalent revenue\n(j)=(h-i) $ 798 $ 784 $ 765 $ 2,335 $ 2,405 $ 3,156\n(non-GAAP)\nPre-provision net revenue (non-\n(h)-(a) $ 302 $ 278 $ 280 $ 806 $ 899 $ 1,059\nGAAP)\nAdjusted PPNR (non-GAAP) (j)-(c) 299 278 272 819 909 1,170\nEfficiency ratio (non-GAAP) 1 (c/j) 62.5 % 64.5 % 64.4 % 64.9 % 62.2 % 62.9 %\n1 Excluding both the $9 million gain on sale of our Enterprise Retirement Solutions business and the $4 million gain on sale of a bank-owned property (recorded in\ndividends and other income), the efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2024 would have been 65.6%.\n39\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1.

For more\ninformation about our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 of our\n2023 Form 10-K.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe following schedule presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nASSETS\nTrading securities $ — $ 68 $ — $ 68\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury, agencies, and corporations 490 7,792 8,282\nMunicipal securities 1,189 1,189\nOther debt securities 24 24\nTotal available-for-sale 490 9,005 — 9,495\nLoans held for sale 58 58\nOther noninterest-bearing investments:\nBank-owned life insurance 560 560\nPrivate equity investments 1 3 105 108\nOther assets:\nAgriculture loan servicing 19 19\nDeferred compensation plan assets 139 139\nDerivatives 382 382\nTotal assets $ 632 $ 10,073 $ 124 $ 10,829\nLIABILITIES\nSecurities sold, not yet purchased $ 4 $ — $ — $ 4\nOther liabilities:\nDerivatives 295 295\nTotal liabilities $ 4 $ 295 $ — $ 299\n1 The Level 1 private equity investments (“PEIs”) generally relate to the portion of our Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments and other similar\ninvestments that are publicly traded.\n47\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nASSETS\nTrading securities $ — $ 48 $ — $ 48\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury, agencies, and corporations 492 8,467 8,959\nMunicipal securities 1,318 1,318\nOther debt securities 23 23\nTotal available-for-sale 492 9,808 — 10,300\nLoans held for sale 43 43\nOther noninterest-bearing investments:\nBank-owned life insurance 553 553\nPrivate equity investments 1 3 92 95\nOther assets:\nAgriculture loan servicing 19 19\nDeferred compensation plan assets 124 124\nDerivatives 420 420\nTotal assets $ 619 $ 10,872 $ 111 $ 11,602\nLIABILITIES\nSecurities sold, not yet purchased $ 65 $ — $ — $ 65\nOther liabilities:\nDerivatives 333 333\nTotal liabilities $ 65 $ 333 $ — $ 398\n1 The Level 1 PEIs generally relate to the portion of our SBIC investments and other similar investments that are publicly traded.\nFair Value Option for Certain Loans Held for Sale\nWe have elected the fair value option for certain commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans that are intended for sale to a third-party conduit for\nsecuritization and are hedged with derivative instruments. Electing the fair value option reduces the accounting volatility that would otherwise\nresult from the asymmetry created by accounting for the loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value,\nwithout the complexity of applying hedge accounting. These loans are included in “Loans held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheet, and\nassociated fair value gains and losses are included in “Capital markets fees” on the consolidated statement of income, while accrued interest is\nincluded in “Interest and fees on loans.”\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $58 million and $43 million of loans measured at fair value ($58 million and $43\nmillion par value), respectively. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recognized approximately $10 million and $3 million of net\ngains from loan sales and valuation adjustments of loans carried at fair value and the associated derivatives, respectively.\nLevel 3 Valuations\nOur Level 3 financial instruments include PEIs and agriculture loan servicing.

At September 30,\n2024, we had approximately $1 million of collateral-dependent loans marked to fair value and classified in Level 2. During the third quarter of\n2024, we recognized $1 million of losses from fair value changes related to these loans.

Derivative\ninstruments may be offset under their master netting agreements; however, for accounting purposes, we present these items on a gross basis on\nour balance sheet. See Note 7 for further information regarding derivative instruments.\n5. INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nInvestment securities are classified as available-for-sale (“AFS”) or held-to-maturity (“HTM”). AFS securities are carried at fair value, and\nchanges in fair value (unrealized gains and losses) are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income\n(“AOCI”), net of related taxes. HTM securities, which management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost.\nThe amortized cost represents the original cost of the investment, adjusted for related amortization or accretion of any purchase premiums or\ndiscounts, and for any impairment losses, including credit-related impairment.\n50\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe carrying values of our investment securities do not include accrued interest receivables of $54 million and $65 million at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These receivables are included in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheet.\nWhen a security is transferred from AFS to HTM, the difference between its amortized cost basis and fair value at the date of transfer is\namortized as a yield adjustment through interest income, and the fair value at the date of transfer results in either a premium or discount to the\namortized cost basis of the HTM securities. The amortization of unrealized gains or losses reported in AOCI will offset the effect of the\namortization of the premium or discount in interest income that is created by the transfer. The discount associated with securities previously\ntransferred from AFS to HTM was $1.9 billion ($1.4 billion after tax) at September 30, 2024, compared with $2.1 billion ($1.5 billion after tax)\nat December 31, 2023.\nSee Notes 3 and 5 of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information regarding our process to estimate the fair value and accounting for our\ninvestment securities, respectively.

For additional\ninformation on our policy and impairment evaluation process for investment securities, see Note 5 of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAFS Impairment\nWe did not recognize any impairment on our AFS investment securities portfolio during the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023. Unrealized\nlosses primarily relate to higher interest rates subsequent to the purchase of securities and are not attributable to credit; as such, absent any future\nsales, we would expect to receive the full principal value at maturity. At September 30, 2024, we had not initiated any sales of AFS securities,\nnor did we have an intent to sell any identified securities with unrealized losses. We do not believe it is more likely than not that we would be\nrequired to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nHTM Impairment\nFor HTM securities, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) is assessed consistent with the approach described in Note 6 for loans and leases\nmeasured at amortized cost. At September 30, 2024, the ACL on HTM securities was less than $1 million, all HTM securities were risk-graded\nas “Pass” in terms of credit quality, and none were considered past due.\n53\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInvestment Securities Gains and Losses Recognized in Income\nThe following schedule presents investment securities gains and losses recognized in income:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross Gross Gross Gross Gross Gross Gross\n(In millions) Gross gains losses gains losses gains losses gains losses\nAvailable-for-sale $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 72 $ 73\nThe following schedule presents interest income by investment security type:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions) Taxable Nontaxable Total Taxable Nontaxable Total\nAvailable-for-sale $ 75 $ 8 $ 83 $ 76 $ 9 $ 85\nHeld-to-maturity 54 1 55 58 1 59\nTotal investment securities $ 129 $ 9 $ 138 $ 134 $ 10 $ 144\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions) Taxable Nontaxable Total Taxable Nontaxable Total\nAvailable-for-sale $ 227 $ 24 $ 251 $ 214 $ 23 $ 237\nHeld-to-maturity 165 3 168 178 3 181\nTotal investment securities $ 392 $ 27 $ 419 $ 392 $ 26 $ 418\n6.

Amortized cost\nbasis does not include accrued interest receivables of $289 million and $299 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. These receivables are included in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheet.\nMunicipal loans generally include loans to state and local governments (“municipalities”) with the debt service being repaid from general funds\nor pledged revenues of the municipal entity, or to private commercial entities or 501(c)(3) not-for-profit entities utilizing a pass-through\nmunicipal entity to achieve favorable tax treatment.\nLand acquisition and development loans included in the construction and land development loan portfolio were $233 million at September 30,\n2024 and $219 million at December 31, 2023.\nLoans with a carrying value of $40.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and $36.3 billion at December 31, 2023 have been pledged at the Federal\nReserve (“FRB”) and the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Des Moines as collateral for current and potential borrowings.\nAt the time of origination, we determine the classification of loans as either held for investment or held for sale. Loans held for sale are measured\nat fair value or the lower of cost or fair value and primarily consist of (1) commercial real estate loans that are sold into securitization entities,\nand (2) conforming residential mortgages that are generally sold to U.S. government agencies. The following schedule presents loans added to,\nor sold from, the held for sale category during the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoans added to held for sale $ 289 $ 183 $ 688 $ 489\nLoans sold from held for sale 304 204 644 480\nOccasionally, we have continuing involvement in the sold loans in the form of servicing rights or guarantees. The principal balance of sold loans\nfor which we retain servicing was $582 million and $431 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Income from sold\nloans, excluding servicing, was $2 million and $5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $8 million and $15\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other income from loans sold includes fair value adjustments on\nloans that are included in “Capital markets fees” on the consolidated statement of income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”), which consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) and the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments (“RULC”), represents our estimate of current expected credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded\nlending commitments as of the balance sheet date. For additional information regarding our policies and methodologies used to estimate the\nACL, see Note 6 of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe ACL for AFS and HTM debt securities is estimated separately from loans. For HTM securities, the ACL is estimated consistent with the\napproach for loans measured at amortized cost.

Factors we consider in determining\nwhether a loan is placed on nonaccrual include delinquency status, collateral value, borrower or guarantor financial statement information,\nbankruptcy status, and other information which would indicate that the full and timely collection of interest and principal is uncertain.\nA nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when (1) all delinquent interest and principal become current in accordance with the terms\nof the loan agreement, (2) the loan, if secured, is well-secured, (3) the borrower has paid according to the contractual terms for a minimum of six\nmonths, and (4) an analysis of the borrower indicates a reasonable assurance of the borrower's ability and willingness to maintain payments.\n57\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe amortized cost basis of nonaccrual loans is summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized cost basis\nTotal amortized\n(In millions) with no allowance with allowance cost basis Related allowance\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial $ 27 $ 146 $ 173 $ 25\nLeasing — 2 2 —\nOwner-occupied 13 16 29 1\nMunicipal 5 6 11 2\nTotal commercial 45 170 215 28\nCommercial real estate:\nConstruction and land development — 2 2 —\nTerm 38 29 67 2\nTotal commercial real estate 38 31 69 2\nConsumer:\nHome equity credit line 4 26 30 6\n1-4 family residential 12 35 47 4\nBankcard and other revolving plans — 1 1 1\nOther — 1 1 —\nTotal consumer 16 63 79 11\nTotal $ 99 $ 264 $ 363 $ 41\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized cost basis\nTotal amortized\n(In millions) with no allowance with allowance cost basis Related allowance\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial $ 11 $ 71 $ 82 $ 30\nLeasing — 2 2 1\nOwner-occupied 12 8 20 1\nTotal commercial 23 81 104 32\nCommercial real estate:\nConstruction and land development 22 — 22 —\nTerm 37 2 39 1\nTotal commercial real estate 59 2 61 1\nConsumer:\nHome equity credit line 1 16 17 5\n1-4 family residential 8 32 40 5\nTotal consumer 9 48 57 10\nTotal $ 91 $ 131 $ 222 $ 43\nFor accruing loans, interest is accrued and interest payments are recognized into interest income according to the contractual loan agreement. For\nnonaccruing loans, the accrual of interest is discontinued, any uncollected or accrued interest is reversed from interest income in a timely manner\n(generally within one month), and any payments received on these loans are not recognized into interest income, but are applied as a reduction to\nthe principal outstanding. When the collectability of the amortized cost basis for a nonaccrual loan is no longer in doubt, then interest payments\nmay be recognized in interest income on a cash basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no interest\nincome recognized on a cash basis during the period the loans were on nonaccrual.\n58\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe amount of accrued interest receivables reversed from interest income during the periods presented is summarized by loan portfolio segment\nas follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCommercial $ 5 $ 2 $ 10 $ 7\nCommercial real estate 1 2 4 2\nConsumer 1 — 3 1\nTotal $ 7 $ 4 $ 17 $ 10\nPast Due Loans\nClosed-end loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported as past due when the borrower is in arrears for two or more monthly payments.\nSimilarly, open-end credits, such as bankcard and other revolving credit plans, are reported as past due when the minimum payment has not been\nmade for two or more billing cycles.

The internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definition of Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful,\nwhich are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications.\n• Pass — A Pass asset is higher-quality and does not fit any of the other categories described below. The likelihood of loss is considered\nlow.\n• Special Mention — A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected,\nthese potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in our credit position at some future\ndate.\n• Substandard — A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we may\nsustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.\n• Doubtful — A Doubtful asset has all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard asset with the added characteristics that the weaknesses\nmake collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.\nThe amount of loans classified as Doubtful totaled $20 million at September 30, 2024; we had no loans classified as Doubtful at December 31,\n2023.\nFor consumer loans and for CRE loans with commitments greater than $1 million, we generally assign internal risk grades similar to those\ndescribed previously based on automated rules that depend on refreshed credit scores, payment performance, and other risk indicators. These are\ngenerally assigned either a Pass, Special Mention, or Substandard grade, and are reviewed as we identify information that might warrant a grade\nchange.\n60\nTable of Contents\nZIONS

ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLoan Modifications\nLoans may be modified in the normal course of business for competitive reasons or to strengthen our collateral position. Loan modifications may\nalso occur when the borrower experiences financial difficulty and needs temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the\nloan. For loans that have been modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we use the same credit loss estimation methods that we\nuse for the rest of the loan portfolio. These methods incorporate the post-modification loan terms, as well as defaults and charge-offs associated\nwith historical modified loans. All nonaccruing loans more than $1 million are evaluated individually, regardless of modification.\nWe consider many factors in determining whether to agree to a loan modification and we seek a solution that will both minimize potential loss to\nus and attempt to help the borrower. We evaluate borrowers’ current and forecasted future cash flows, their ability and willingness to make\ncurrent contractual or proposed modified payments, the value of the underlying collateral (if applicable), the possibility of obtaining additional\nsecurity or guarantees, and the potential costs related to a repossession or foreclosure and the subsequent sale of the collateral.\nA modified loan on nonaccrual will generally remain on nonaccrual until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified\nstructure for a minimum of six months, and there is evidence that such payments can and are likely to continue as agreed. Performance prior to\nthe modification, or significant events that coincide with the modification, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new\nterms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of modification or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s\nability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains on nonaccrual.\nOn an ongoing basis, we monitor the performance of all modified loans according to their modified terms. The amortized cost of modified loans\nthat had a payment default during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were still in default at period end, and were\nwithin 12 months or less of being modified was approximately $5 million for both periods, primarily commercial real estate loans, and less than\n$1 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe amortized cost of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the period, by loan class and modification\ntype, is summarized in the following

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nObjectives and Accounting\nOur primary objective for using derivatives is to manage interest rate risk. We use derivatives to stabilize forecasted interest income from\nvariable-rate assets and to modify the coupon or the duration of fixed-rate financial assets or liabilities. We also assist clients with their risk\nmanagement needs through the use of derivatives. Cash receipts and payments from derivatives designated in qualifying hedging relationships\nare classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the statement of cash flows, and cash flows from\nundesignated derivatives are classified as operating activities. For a more detailed discussion of the use of and accounting policies regarding\nderivative instruments, see Note 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFair Value Hedges of Liabilities — During the second quarter of 2023, we terminated our remaining receive-fixed interest rate swap with a\nnotional amount of $500 million that had been designated in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship of fixed-rate debt. The receive-fixed\ninterest rate swap effectively converted the interest on our fixed-rate debt to floating until it was terminated. Prior to termination, changes in the\nfair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of debt were offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments. The\nunamortized hedge basis adjustments resulting from the terminated hedging relationship are being amortized over the remaining life of the fixed-\nrate debt.\nFair Value Hedges of Assets — Fair value hedges of fixed-rate assets effectively convert the fixed interest income to a floating rate on the hedged\nportion of the assets. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate financial assets were largely offset by\nchanges in the value of the hedged assets, as shown in the schedules on the following pages. At September 30, 2024, we had pay-fixed, receive-\nfloating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.6 billion designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate AFS securities. We\nhad pay-fixed swaps with an additional $1.0 billion of aggregate notional designated as hedges of fixed-rate commercial loans.\nCash Flow Hedges — Cash flow hedges of variable-rate assets and liabilities effectively convert the variable interest receipts and payments to\nfixed. At September 30, 2024, we had receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $350 million\ndesignated as cash flow hedges of pools of floating-rate commercial loans. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had one pay-fixed, receive-\nfloating interest rate swap with a notional amount of $500 million designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the interest payments on\ncertain FHLB advances. Changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges during the quarter were recorded in AOCI as shown in the\nschedule below. The amounts deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings in the periods in which\n72\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nthe hedged interest receipts or payments occur (i.e., when the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings). At September 30, 2024, there was\n$117 million of losses deferred in AOCI related to terminated cash flow hedges that are expected to be fully reclassified into earnings by October\n2027.\nCollateral and Credit Risk\nExposure to credit risk arises from the possibility of nonperformance by counterparties. No significant losses on derivative instruments have\noccurred as a result of counterparty nonperformance. For more information on how we incorporate counterparty credit risk in derivative\nvaluations, see Note 3 of our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional discussion of collateral and the associated credit risk related to our derivative\ncontracts, see Note 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nOur derivative contracts require us to pledge collateral for derivatives that are in a net liability position at a given balance sheet date. Certain of\nthese derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that include the requirement to maintain a minimum debt credit rating.\nWe may be required to pledge additional collateral if a credit risk-related feature were triggered, such as a downgrade of our credit rating. In past\nsituations, counterparties have not generally required that additional collateral be pledged when provided for by the contractual terms. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the fair value of our derivative liabilities was $295 million, for which we were required to pledge cash collateral of $4\nmillion in the normal course of business.

Litigation may relate to\nlending, deposit and other customer relationships, vendor and contractual issues, employee matters, intellectual property matters, personal\ninjuries and torts, regulatory and legal compliance, and other matters. While most matters relate to individual claims, we are also subject to\nputative class action claims and similar broader claims. Proceedings, investigations, examinations, and other actions brought or considered by\ngovernmental and self-regulatory agencies may relate to our banking, investment advisory, trust, securities, and other products and services; our\ncustomers’ involvement in money laundering, fraud, securities violations and other illicit activities or our policies and practices relating to such\ncustomer activities; and our compliance with the broad range of banking, securities and other laws and regulations applicable to us. At any given\ntime, we may be in the process of responding to subpoenas, requests for documents, data and testimony relating to such matters and engaging in\ndiscussions to resolve the matters.\nAt September 30, 2024, we were subject to the following material litigation:\n• Two civil cases, Lifescan, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson Health Care Services v. Jeffrey Smith, et. al., brought against us in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey in December 2017, and Roche Diagnostics and Roche Diabetes Care Inc. v. Jeffrey C. Smith, et.\nal., brought against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in March 2019. In these cases, certain manufacturers\nand distributors of medical products seek to hold us liable for allegedly fraudulent practices of a borrower of the Bank who filed for\nbankruptcy protection in 2017. No trial has been set.\n• In the matter of Streck and Ariza v. Zions Bancorporation, N.A., an arbitration matter pending before the American Arbitration Association,\nrelated to an employment dispute brought by two former employees alleging damages arising from claims of alleged gender discrimination,\nretaliation, and constructive discharge. The case is in the dispositive motion phase.\nAt least quarterly, we review outstanding and new legal matters, utilizing then-available information. In accordance with applicable accounting\nguidance, if we determine that a loss from a matter is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish an accrual\nfor the loss. In the absence of such a determination, no accrual is made. Once established, accruals are adjusted to reflect developments relating\nto the matters.\n79\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn our review, we also assess whether we can determine the range of reasonably possible losses for significant matters in which we are unable to\ndetermine that the likelihood of a loss is remote. Because of the difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, discussed subsequently, we\nare able to meaningfully estimate such a range only for a limited number of matters. Based on information available at September 30, 2024, we\nestimated that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses for those matters to be from zero to approximately $10 million in excess of\namounts accrued. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this\nestimate. Those matters for which a meaningful estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range and, therefore, this\nestimated range does not represent our maximum loss exposure.\nBased on our current knowledge, we believe that our estimated liability for litigation and other legal actions and claims, reflected in our accruals\nand determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, is adequate and that liabilities in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if\nany, arising from litigation and other legal actions and claims for which an estimate as previously described is possible, will not have a material\nimpact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in light of the significant uncertainties involved in these matters,\nand the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be\nmaterial to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for any given reporting period.\nAny estimate or determination relating to the future resolution of litigation, arbitration, governmental or self-regulatory examinations,\ninvestigations or actions or similar matters is inherently uncertain and involves significant judgment. This is particularly true in the early stages\nof a legal matter, when legal issues and facts have not been well articulated, reviewed, analyzed, and vetted through discovery, preparation for\ntrial or hearings, substantive and productive mediation or settlement discussions, or other actions. It is also particularly true with respect to class\naction and similar claims involving multiple defendants, matters with complex procedural requirements or substantive issues or novel legal\ntheories, and examinations, investigations and other actions conducted or brought by governmental and self-regulatory agencies, in which the\nnormal adjudicative process is not applicable. Accordingly, we usually are unable to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is\nremote, reasonably likely, or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss, until relatively late in the\ncourse of a legal matter, sometimes not until a number of years have elapsed. Accordingly, our judgments and estimates relating to claims will\nchange from time to time in light of developments and actual outcomes will differ from our estimates. These differences may be material.\n80\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n11.

INCOME TAXES\nThe effective income tax rate was 22.7% for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 23.2% for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates\nfor the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 23.5% and 24.7%, respectively. The tax rates during both periods were reduced by nontaxable\nmunicipal interest income and nontaxable income from\n82\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\ncertain bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”), and were increased by the nondeductibility of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)\npremiums, certain executive compensation plans, and other fringe benefits. The FDIC insurance premiums are nondeductible, whereas the FDIC\nspecial assessments are tax deductible.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) totaling $879 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The\nnet DTA or deferred tax liability (“DTL”) is included in either “Other assets” or “Other liabilities,” respectively, on the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nWe evaluate DTAs on a regular basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. In conducting this evaluation, we consider all\navailable evidence, both positive and negative, based on the more-likely-than-not criteria that such assets will be realized. This evaluation\nincludes, but is not limited to, the following:\n• Future reversals of existing DTLs — These DTLs have a reversal pattern generally consistent with DTAs and are used to realize the\nDTAs.\n• Tax planning strategies — We have considered prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that we would implement to preserve the\nvalue of the DTAs, if necessary.\n• Future projected taxable income — We expect future taxable income will offset the reversal of remaining net DTAs.\nBased on this evaluation, we concluded that a valuation allowance was not required at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n13.

OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe manage our operations with a primary focus on geographic area. We conduct our operations primarily through seven separately managed\naffiliate banks, each with its own local branding and management team, including Zions Bank, California Bank & Trust, Amegy Bank, National\nBank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and The Commerce Bank of Washington. These affiliate banks comprise our\nprimary business segments. Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographic structure. Our affiliate banks are\nsupported by an enterprise operating segment (referred to as the “Other” segment) that provides governance and risk management, allocates\ncapital, establishes strategic objectives, and includes centralized technology, back-office functions, and certain lines of business not operated\nthrough our affiliate banks.\nWe allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services. We also\nallocate capital based on the risk-weighted assets held at each business segment. We use an internal funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) allocation\nprocess to report results of operations for business segments. This process is subject to change and refinement over time. Total average loans and\ndeposits presented for the business segments include insignificant intercompany amounts between business segments and may also include\ndeposits with the “Other” segment.\nAt September 30, 2024, Zions Bank operated 95 branches in Utah, 25 branches in Idaho, and one branch in Wyoming. CB&T operated 75\nbranches in California. Amegy operated 76 branches in Texas. NBAZ operated 56 branches in Arizona. NSB operated 43 branches in Nevada.\nVectra operated 34 branches in Colorado and one branch in New Mexico. TCBW operated two branches in Washington and one branch in\nOregon.\nOn September 23, 2024, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase four FirstBank Coachella Valley, California branches\nand their associated deposit and loan accounts. These branches will be operated by our CB&T affiliate bank. In addition to the four branches, the\npurchase includes approximately $700 million in deposits and $400 million in commercial and consumer loans. These amounts are subject to\nchange. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.\nTransactions between business segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated for reporting consolidated\nresults of operations. The following schedule presents average loans, average deposits, and income before income taxes because we use these\nmetrics when evaluating performance and making decisions pertaining to the business segments. The condensed statement of income identifies\nthe components of income and expense which affect the operating amounts presented in the “Other” segment.\n84\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following schedule presents selected operating segment information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nZions Bank CB&T Amegy\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 178 $ 167 $ 150 $ 143 $ 130 $ 107\nProvision for credit losses 11 1 — 24 4 7\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 167 166 150 119 126 100\nNoninterest income 46 49 31 28 44 46\nNoninterest expense 140 130 100 91 111 93\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 73 $ 85 $ 81 $ 56 $ 59 $ 53\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 14,762 $ 14,382 $ 14,315 $ 14,195 $ 13,531 $ 12,892\nTotal average deposits 21,386 20,041 14,643 14,335 14,633 13,997\nNBAZ NSB Vectra\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 62 $ 66 $ 51 $ 46 $ 38 $ 36\nProvision for credit losses 7 3 (14) 7 2 (1)\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 55 63 65 39 36 37\nNoninterest income 11 10 12 12 7 8\nNoninterest expense 49 44 44 40 34 32\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 17 $ 29 $ 33 $ 11 $ 9 $ 13\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 5,647 $ 5,364 $ 3,520 $ 3,420 $ 4,106 $ 4,011\nTotal average deposits 6,904 7,002 7,156 7,059 3,531 3,463\nTCBW Other Consolidated Bank\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 16 $ 15 $ (5) $ 5 $ 620 $ 585\nProvision for credit losses 2 2 1 (2) 13 41\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 14 13 (6) 7 607 544\nNoninterest income 2 2 19 25 172 180\nNoninterest expense 8 6 16 60 502 496\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 8 $ 9 $ (3) $ (28) $ 277 $ 228\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 1,833 $ 1,697 $ 951 $ 1,007 $ 58,665 $ 56,968\nTotal average deposits 1,148 1,138 5,628 8,608 75,029 75,643\n85\nTable of Contents\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following schedule presents selected operating segment information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nZions Bank CB&T Amegy\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 514 $ 530 $ 434 $ 454 $ 362 $ 346\nProvision for credit losses (7) 32 17 39 22 30\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 521 498 417 415 340 316\nNoninterest income 136 148 87 87 128 143\nNoninterest expense 432 403 304 277 340 291\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 225 $ 243 $ 200 $ 225 $ 128 $ 168\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 14,792 $ 14,205 $ 14,203 $ 14,122 $ 13,331 $ 12,872\nTotal average deposits 21,010 20,058 14,530 14,103 14,705 13,055\nNBAZ NSB Vectra\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 181 $ 194 $ 147 $ 145 $ 111 $ 115\nProvision for credit losses 11 7 (12) 18 (3) 5\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 170 187 159 127 114 110\nNoninterest income 31 31 40 34 20 21\nNoninterest expense 147 136 133 123 104 99\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 54 $ 82 $ 66 $ 38 $ 30 $ 32\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 5,631 $ 5,253 $ 3,525 $ 3,392 $ 4,078 $ 3,997\nTotal average deposits 6,897 7,018 7,187 6,887 3,486 3,479\nTCBW Other Consolidated Bank\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\nNet interest income $ 46 $ 46 $ 8 $ 25 $ 1,803 $ 1,855\nProvision for credit losses 6 4 (3) (3) 31 132\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 40 42 11 28 1,772 1,723\nNoninterest income 6 5 59 60 507 529\nNoninterest expense 24 18 53 169 1,537 1,516\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 22 $ 29 $ 17 $ (81) $ 742 $ 736\nSELECTED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA\nTotal average loans $ 1,772 $ 1,699 $ 957 $ 1,063 $ 58,289 $ 56,603\nTotal average deposits 1,126 1,206 5,267 6,030 74,208 71,836\nITEM 3.

Survival.\nTrustee’s and Sponsor's respective obligations under this Agreement, which by their nature would continue beyond the termination of this\nAgreement, including but not limited to those contained in Sections 6(c), 8(e), 17, and 19, shall survive any termination of the Agreement.\nd.

Advice Services\nWith respect to any Plan designated as a defined contribution plan and that is subject to Title I of ERISA, if Fidelity provides to Participants or\nPlan beneficiaries Services that constitute fiduciary investment advice that is subject to ERISA § 3(21), Fidelity will:\na. to the extent Fidelity provides advice to Participants or Plan beneficiaries regarding investment of their account, only recommend\nproducts and/or services from investment options available under the Plan recordkept by Fidelity as outlined in disclosures provided to\nParticipants from time to time and made available to Client; and\nb. to the extent it provides advice regarding plan distributions, only recommend the following: retaining balance in the Plan, roll over to\nanother eligible plan recordkept by Fidelity, and/ or rollover to a Fidelity Individual Retirement Account; and\nc. only provide point-in-time recommendations and investment assistance and has no obligation to monitor any such recommendation to\ndetermine whether it is followed by such Participant or Plan beneficiary or should change over time, and will provide each Participant or\nPlan beneficiary with information on how to contact Fidelity to obtain updated or new recommendations; and\nd. to the extent necessary to avoid a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or the Internal Revenue Code, rely on one or\nmore exemptions that may apply to its provision of investment advice, potentially including the following - i) the Pension Protection Act\ncomputer model and/or level fee exemptions under Section 408(b)(14) and 408(g) of ERISA and Labor Regs. Section 2550.408g-1; ii)\nProhibited Transaction Class Exemption 2020-02, Improving Investment Advice for Workers & Retirees; and iii) other exemptions that\nexist under applicable law, now or in the future. The advice arrangements subject to §§ 408(b)(14) and 408(g) of ERISA and Labor\nregulations § 2550.408g-1 will be audited annually by an independent auditor for compliance with the requirements of the statutory\nexemption and related regulations. A copy of the auditor’s findings will be made available within 60 days following completion of the\naudit. Client agrees that Fidelity may provide advice to Participants pursuant to these exemptions.\n31\nFurthermore, with respect to any Plan designated as a defined contribution plan that is not subject to Title I of ERISA, Fidelity may make\neducation and guidance Services available to Plan Participants that may include investment advice (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act\nor other applicable law) and cause Fidelity to be considered a fiduciary with respect to such Services. If any such Plan is not subject to ERISA\nbecause it is excluded from coverage under Title I of ERISA by virtue of the Department of Labor's regulation at 29 C.F.R 2510.3-2(f), the Client\nwill not be considered by Fidelity to be arranging for or endorsing any advice, or establishing or maintaining a retirement plan.\nSection 19. Use of Data.\nIn order to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the Trustee may receive Personal Data. With respect to Personal Data it receives, the\nTrustee agrees to (i) safeguard Personal Data in accordance with its privacy policy, and (ii) exercise the same standard of care in safeguarding\nsuch Personal Data that it uses to protect the personal data of its own employees.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may monitor the Trustee's interactions with Participants and the Administrator authorizes the\nTrustee to permit third-party prospects of the Trustee to monitor Participants' interactions for the purpose of evaluating Trustee's services.\ni. Data Security. Trustee will follow the information security practices detailed in the Information Security Program (as may be\nupdated by Trustee from time to time), made available to Sponsor through PSW® or other electronic means and the attached\nSchedule I - Information Security Schedule.\nii. Restrictions on Use of Personal Data. Trustee’s privacy information management system governing the privacy of Personal Data in\nsupport of the DC service line is aligned and certified to the ISO 27701 framework. To provide assurances about its privacy\ngovernance framework, Trustee will make available its current ISO 27701 certification. Trustee will treat Personal Data in\naccordance with its Privacy Policy and the Consumer Privacy Rights Addendum (as may be updated by Trustee from time to time),\nmade available to the Administrator through PSW® or other electronic means. Trustee will only use Personal Data as the\nAdministrator authorizes, including as provided under this Agreement, or in response to a Participant’s expression of a need or\ninterest in a Fidelity product or service, or as the Participant otherwise permits.\niii. Data Conditions. Sponsor represents that all data and documentation, including employee data and/or participant data (the “Data”)\nprovided to Trustee to be used in performing the services under this Agreement shall be provided in a timely manner, in good\ncondition, correct, complete and submitted in accordance with Trustee’s specifications (such specifications to be provided to the\nSponsor by the Trustee from time to time) and guidelines, including the Reference Guidelines developed by the Trustee with respect\nto Content to be posted on NetBenefits. Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of such data and shall\nhave (i) no liability for inaccuracies in Data originating from Sponsor, the Sponsor participants or Sponsor’s third party service\nproviders, (ii) no duty to verify such information except where the data is clearly erroneous on its face, and (iii) no responsibility for\nContent posted on NetBenefits. If any data is not submitted in accordance with these requirements, or if Trustee detects errors or\nomissions in the data\n32\nsubmitted, Trustee shall promptly notify Sponsor and return such data to Sponsor for correction and modification unless (i) Sponsor\nand Trustee agree, in writing, that Trustee is to make corrections or modifications to the data for an additional fee, or (ii) the Sponsor\nwill provide prompt direction as necessary to correct any errors or omissions in the Data. The Trustee may remove, edit or modify\nContent that does not comply with the Reference Guidelines. For purposes of these requirements and except to the extent such\ntreatment would be inconsistent with applicable law, Trustee may treat scanned electronic copies of paper records as the official\nrecords.\niv. Customer Protection. Trustee maintains controls (e.g., two factor authentication and real-time security alerts) designed to protect\nParticipants against risks of identity theft and fraud. To decrease such risks, Trustee requires Participant contact information (such as\naddress, email, and mobile phone number). Sponsor authorizes Trustee to collect such information from Participants at registration\nor periodically thereafter and shall timely provide Trustee such information on request, as Trustee may be unable to administer such\ncontrols without such information. If either Party becomes aware of security concerns regarding a Participant’s account, Sponsor\nwill reasonably assist Trustee in the investigation.\nSection 20. Governing Law.\ni.Massachusetts Law Controls.\nThis Agreement is being made in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Trust shall be administered as a Massachusetts trust. The\nvalidity, construction, effect, and administration of this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, except to the extent those laws are superseded under section 514 of ERISA.\nii.Trust Agreement Controls.\nThe Trustee is not a party to the Plan, and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the trust provisions of this\nAgreement, the trust provisions of this Agreement shall control.\nSection 21. Plan Qualification.\nThe Plan is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code and the Trust established hereunder is intended to be tax-exempt under\nsection 501(a) of the Code. The Sponsor represents that to the extent Participants are able to instruct the investment of their account, the Plan is\nintended to constitute a plan described in section 404(c) of ERISA and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c-\nThe Sponsor has the sole responsibility for ensuring the Plan's qualified status and full compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA.\nThe Sponsor hereby certifies that it has furnished to the Trustee a complete copy of the Plan and all amendments thereto in effect as of the date\nof this Agreement.\nSection 22. Use of Omnibus Accounts.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Sponsor understands, acknowledges and agrees that, (i) the Trustee utilizes omnibus\naccounts at unaffiliated banks to facilitate transactions for\n33\nthe defined contribution plans it services and commingles funds in transit to or from the Plan, including other funds similarly in transit to or from\nother plans and (ii) if markets permit, omnibus account balances may be invested in short-term investments with the aim of earning a rate\napproximating the Target Federal Funds Rate and/or money market rates (such earnings are referred to as “float earnings”); and (iii) the Trustee\nwill use these earnings to pay bank fees associated with the above-referenced defined contribution plan transactions and make other required\nadjustments and will retain any float earnings that exceed such fees and adjustments as compensation for its services, except as otherwise set\nforth in Schedule B, Fee Schedule. The Trustee shall pay bank fees to the extent they exceed float earnings.\nThe amount of float earnings generated depends on market conditions, as well as on the length of time that funds are held in the omnibus\naccounts. The following time frames apply with respect to funds held in these accounts:\n• If contributions and instructions to purchase investment options are received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading,\nthe Trustee executes transactions in the investment options as of that day’s closing price (the “transaction date” or “T”). Contributions\nare held in the omnibus account until the following business day (“T+1”) for the vast majority of investment options. For share\naccounted company stock transactions, contributions may be held in the omnibus account until T+3.\n• Instructions to exchange investment options received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day’s\nnightly cycle. For the vast majority of investment options, exchanges generate no overnight balances, as money is received from one\ninvestment option and conveyed to another investment option on the same business day. The limited exceptions to this would occur if\ninvestment options have different settlement rules and Fidelity Management Trust Company serves as trustee of the Plan, in which case\nbalances attributable to the exchange may remain in an omnibus account for a few days.\n• Instructions to make disbursements received In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day’s nightly cycle and\nreflected as debits from participant accounts as of that date (“T”). Proceeds attributable to the disbursement are received into the\nomnibus account based on the settlement period for the investment options, which in the substantial majority of investment options is\nT+1. After the deduction of tax withholding, if applicable, disbursements are typically made on T+2 or T+3 either through electronic\nfunds transfers or by mailing a check. Disbursement proceeds distributed by check, net of any tax withholdings, remain in the omnibus\naccount until the check is presented for payment.\nNeither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be liable for any diminution in the value of such overnight investments. Provided that the Sponsor has\nprovided timely funding, neither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be responsible for any failure to settle or clear from such omnibus accounts any\nproper or timely trade or disbursement if such failure results from a decrease in the value, or temporary inaccessibility of funds attributable to\neither the use of a specific bank or the overnight investment of balances from such accounts.\nSection 23. Investment Management Communications.\nNotwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator and Sponsor hereby authorize the Trustee and affiliates of the\nTrustee, throughout the term of this Agreement and any extensions thereto, to provide Participants with communications related to workplace\nand/or personal investment management products or services. The Trustee and affiliates of the Trustee may use for such\n34\npurpose any information received hereunder or otherwise related to the Plan or Sponsor; all such information collected or used shall be treated in\naccordance with Fidelity Investments' privacy policy.\n35\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized officers as of the day and\nyear first above written. By signing below, the undersigned represent that they are authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of the\nrespective parties.

These\nguidelines are subject to change upon written notice to the Sponsor.\ni. Rebalancing Participant Accounts. Assets in the Participant’s Plan Account are rebalanced on an ongoing basis to ensure\nalignment with the assigned asset allocation strategy and the current model portfolio. There are two primary types of rebalancing\nactivities:\n1) Portfolios may be rebalanced periodically to account for changes in market valuations to ensure Participant Accounts are\nproperly aligned to their model portfolio allocations.\nPortfolios are also monitored each Business Day to ensure that any Participant directed activities (such as withdrawals or loans)\nhave not caused the Participant Account to vary from the assigned market-adjusted model portfolio by more than a standard drift\nallowance set by Strategic Advisers.\n2) Rebalance transactions will be created in the nightly cycle for processing on the following Business Day and will be reflected in\nParticipant Accounts on the day following the rebalance transaction date.\nii. Reallocation of Model Portfolios. If there is a reallocation of the model portfolio (resulting from review of the Plan’s investment\noptions or a change in the Plan investment option menu), those Participant Accounts that vary from the revised model portfolio\nby more than a standard drift allowance set by Strategic Advisers will be flagged for reallocation. Reallocation transactions will\nbe processed using the same rules as for rebalance transactions.\niii. Changes to Investor Profile. If a change in model portfolios is required as a result of an annual or ad hoc review of the\nParticipant’s investor profile completed before Market Close on a Business Day, the required exchanges shall be processed\nwithin the next 5 Business Days, and reflected in the Participant’s Account within three Business Days.\niv. Termination of Service. If receipt of a Participant’s election to terminate Personalized Planning & Advice is confirmed before\nMarket Close, the Account will not be flagged for rebalancing or reallocation, and any pending rebalance or reallocation\ntransactions will be automatically cancelled. If receipt of a Participant’s election to terminate Personalized Planning & Advice is\nconfirmed after Market Close, and an exchange is then pending for processing in the nightly cycle for such date, such exchanges\nshall be processed as of the Market Close on such date.\nSCHEDULE “H” - Investment Management Agreement (FPPA)\nParty Information\nPlan Information\nState of\nParty Legal Name Contact for Notices\nFormation Address\nFidelity Personal and Workplace Advisors 245 Summer Street, V7A\nFPWA: DE VP, WI Contracts\nLLC Boston, MA 02210\nStrategic 245 Summer Street, V7A\nStrategic Advisers LLC DE VP, WI Contracts\nAdvisers: Boston, MA 02210\nSponsor: Zions Bancorporation, N.A.

Payshelter 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan\nPlan Number: 29148\nBeginning upon the Plan’s enrollment in the Managed Account Service, the annual advisory fee for the Managed Account Service will be\nassessed based on a percentage of the average daily balance of Managed Assets of enrolled Participants. The advisory fee will be charged to\ncover ongoing management of the Managed Assets, and related servicing and Participant communication. The fee is payable quarterly in arrears,\nand will be calculated on the basis of daily Participant balances, generally on the 25th day of the last month of the Participant statement cycle\nquarter (or the next Business Day if the 25th is not a Business Day).\nUnless paid by the Sponsor, the Trustee or its agent will redeem investments in the amount of the net advisory fee directly from enrolled\nParticipants’ Plan accounts on the Business Day following the fee calculation. The amount of the fee deducted from a Participant’s account will\nbe noted on the Participant’s statement.\nThe annual net advisory fee for the Managed Account Service will be calculated by deducting a Plan Credit Amount (as defined below) from the\nPlan’s annual gross advisory fee set forth in the table below.\nANNUAL GROSS ADVISORY FEE SCHEDULE\nAverage Daily Balance of Managed Assets Less Than 20% Eligible Equal to, or Greater Than,\nParticipant Enrollment 20% Eligible Participant\nEnrollment1\nFor the first $100,000 in assets, or portion 0.55% 0.50%\nthereof\nFor the next $150,000 in assets, or portion 0.50% 0.40%\nthereof\nAll assets over $250,000 0.35% 0.25%\n*The Gross Advisory fees applicable to plans that exceed 20% enrollment will take effect beginning with the first day of the quarter in which the\n20% threshold was exceeded.\nPlan Credit Amount and Net Advisory Fee. The purpose of the Plan Credit Amount is to reduce the annual gross advisory fee payable by the\nPlan by the amount of asset-based fees, if any, Strategic Advisers or its affiliates receive for management of Fidelity Mutual Funds in which\nManaged Assets are invested, and for other services related to any other investment option offered under the Plan in which Managed Assets are\ninvested.\nThis Plan Credit Amount will be calculated daily in the following manner: For each investment option in which Managed Assets are invested,\nan amount will be calculated equal to the sum of (a) the actual underlying investment management fees paid to Strategic Advisers or its\naffiliates from such investment if it is a Fidelity Mutual Fund (but not other fund expenses such as transfer agency fees); and (b) the servicing\nor other fees paid to and retained by Strategic Advisers and its affiliates based on assets or Participants in any investment option other than\nFidelity Mutual Funds. The resulting amounts for all investments of Managed Assets will be added together to arrive at the Plan Credit Amount.\nThe Plan Credit Amount will be applied (as a percentage) equally across all Participant accounts to arrive at the annual net advisory fee for that\nParticipant. It is expected that the Plan Credit Amount will vary over time, based upon the funds selected for investment of Managed Assets.\nIn the event a Participant's participation in the Managed Account Service is terminated before the end of a quarter but such Participant remains\nenrolled in the Plan, the gross advisory fee applicable to that quarter will be prorated based on the number of days the account was managed\nduring the quarter, and such Participant's net advisory fees for the pro-rated quarter will be calculated using the Plan Credit Amount applicable\nto the prior quarter.\nIf, prior to the end of a billing quarter, either, (a) a Participant's participation in the Managed Account Service is terminated simultaneously with\nthat Participant's enrollment in the Plan, or (b) the Plan terminates the Managed Account Service in its entirety, then the gross advisory fee\napplicable to that quarter will be prorated based on the number of days the account was managed during the quarter. In such cases, a\nParticipant's gross advisory fees for the pro-rated quarter will be reduced by a\ncredit amount equal to (a) the actual underlying investment management fees paid to Strategic Advisers or its affiliates from investments in\nsuch Participant's account for Fidelity Mutual Funds (but not other fund expenses such as transfer agency fees); and (b) the servicing or other\nfees paid to and retained by Strategic Advisers and its affiliates based on assets from such Participant's account invested in any investment\noption other than Fidelity Mutual Funds.\nAs noted above, the Plan's annual gross advisory fee has been determined based on the composition of the Plan's available investment options.\nThe Plan's annual gross advisory fee has been set at a level that, when reduced by the Plan Credit Amount, should result in Participants paying\napproximately the annual target net fee shown below. Note that, because the Plan Credit Amount will vary over time, the actual amount of net\nadvisory fee paid by any Participant will vary based upon, among other things, the funds selected for investment by the Service and the number\nand asset allocations of Participants enrolled in the Plan. As a result, a Participant's net advisory fee may be higher or lower than the target net\nadvisory shown in the table below:\nTARGET ANNUAL NET ADVISORY FEE SCHEDULE\nAverage daily account Less than 20% eligible Greater than 20% eligible\nbalance participant enrollment participant enrollment\nFor the first $100,000 or 0.50% 0.45%\nportion thereof\nFor the next $100,000 to 0.45% 0.35%\n$250,000, or portion\nthereof\nAll additional assets over 0.30% 0.20%\n$250,000\nAs noted above, the Plan Credit Amount and annual net advisory fee will vary over time. However, given the investment options available in\nthe Plan as of the date of this Agreement and expected rates of enrollment in the Service, Strategic Advisers anticipates that the annual net\nadvisory fees paid by any Participant in the Plan will fall within the ranges shown below.\nTARGET RANGE OF ANNUAL NET ADVISORY FEES\nAverage daily account Less than 20% eligible Greater than 20% eligible\nbalance participant enrollment participant enrollment\nFor the first $100,000 or 0.55% - 0.45% 0.50%-0.40%\nportion thereof\nFor the next $100,000 to 0.50%-0.40% 0.40%-0.30%\n$250,000, or portion\nthereof\nAll additional assets over 0.35%-0.25% 0.25%-0.15%\n$250,000\nIn rare circumstances, due to the variable nature of the Plan Credit Amount, the net advisory fee payable by Participants may fall outside of the\nranges shown above.\nThe annual net advisory fee shall be charged in addition to any applicable management fees, purchase fee, short-term trading fee, or similar fee\npayable to the applicable mutual fund, or any fee paid to Strategic Advisers or its affiliates for services rendered to the Plan (including trustee\nor recordkeeping services) or to the investment options offered under the Plan.\nNote: Should the Sponsor or Authorizing Party modify the investment options available through the Plan, Strategic Advisers shall have the\nright to modify this pricing schedule upon sixty (60) days' notice.\nFrom time to time, Strategic Advisers may provide a pricing incentive to encourage enrollment in the service. Unless otherwise specified, the\npricing incentives will either allow eligible Plan participants who are not enrolled in the service to have the Service free of Advisory Fees for a\nstated period of time, or will allow eligible participants who are not enrolled in the service a stated discount from the plan's Gross Advisory fee\nduring a specified period. The Authorizing Party will receive prior notice of any pricing incentive. In the unlikely event that the Plan Credit\nAmount exceeds the Gross Advisory Fees for any quarter in which a pricing incentive is in effect, the excess shall be added to the Plan Credit\nAmount for the following quarter. In such event, no new pricing incentives will be initiated until any previously unused Plan Credit Amount\nhas been used to offset Gross Advisory Fees. In the event that there is unused Plan Credit Amounts for three successive quarters, the amount\nshall be converted to a Service Credit, which may be applied exclusively for any Plan-related service obtained by the Plan from Strategic\nAdvisers or any Strategic Advisers affiliate that would otherwise be payable under the terms of existing agreements (other than non-SAI\ninvestment management fees, expenses already deducted from Participant accounts, or expenses incorporated into a mil rate). The Service\nCredit will be credited to a non-interest bearing hypothetical account in respect of the Plan, and will expire twelve months after the end of the\nquarter in which it was credited.\nSchedule B to Investment Management Agreement (FPPA)\nInvestment Guidelines for Fidelity® Personalized Planning & Advice\nIn providing discretionary management, Strategic Advisers shall Participant asset allocations generally will be reviewed three to six\nmanage Managed Assets in an enrolled Participant’s Account by times per year, and a Participant may be reassigned to an asset\nselecting from among the Investment Options in order to provide allocation that matches his or her updated profile.

The decrease in average securities was primarily due to principal reductions.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.3 billion, or 8%, from the prior year quarter, driven by increases of\n$2.5 billion and $1.8 billion in average interest-bearing deposits and average borrowed funds, respectively.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, N.A.\nPress Release – Page 3\nNoninterest Income\n3Q24 - 2Q24 3Q24 - 3Q23\n(In millions) 3Q24 2Q24 3Q23 $ % $ %\nCommercial account fees $ 46 $ 45 $ 43 $ 1 2 % $ 3 7 %\nCard fees 24 25 26 (1) (4) (2) (8)\nRetail and business banking fees 18 16 17 2 13 1 6\nLoan-related fees and income 17 18 23 (1) (6) (6) (26)\nCapital markets fees 28 21 18 7 33 10 56\nWealth management fees 14 15 15 (1) (7) (1) (7)\nOther customer-related fees 14 14 15 — — (1) (7)\nCustomer-related noninterest income 161 154 157 7 5 4 3\nFair value and nonhedge derivative income (loss) (3) (1) 7 (2) NM (10) NM\nDividends and other income 5 22 12 (17) (77) (7) (58)\nSecurities gains (losses), net 9 4 4 5 NM 5 NM\nTotal noninterest income $ 172 $ 179 $ 180 $ (7) (4) $ (8) (4)\nCustomer-related noninterest income increased $4 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year period.

These increases were partially offset by a\n$6 million decrease in loan-related fees and income, primarily due to higher gains on loan sales in the prior year\nperiod and a decline in loan servicing income resulting from the sale of associated mortgage servicing rights in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nFair value and nonhedge derivative income decreased $10 million, primarily due to credit valuation adjustments on\nclient-related interest rate swaps, and dividends and other income decreased $7 million, primarily due to a decline in\ndividends on FHLB stock.

We invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to generate interest\nincome. We primarily own securities that can readily provide us cash and liquidity through secured borrowing\nagreements without the need to sell the securities. Our fixed-rate securities portfolio helps balance the inherent interest\nrate mismatch between loans and deposits and protects the economic value of shareholders' equity.

The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $736 million at September 30,\n2024, and was relatively flat compared with $738 million at September 30, 2023. The slight decrease in the ACL\nprimarily reflects improvements in economic forecasts and declines in unfunded lending commitments related to\nconstruction lending, partially offset by increases associated with declines in credit quality, incremental reserves\nassociated with portfolio-specific risks including commercial real estate (“CRE”), average loan growth of $1.7 billion,\nand changes in our loan portfolio composition. The ratio of ACL to total loans and leases was 1.25% at September 30,\n2024, compared with 1.30% at September 30, 2023.\nNet loan and lease charge-offs totaled $3 million, compared with $14 million in the prior year quarter. Nonperforming\nassets totaled $368 million, or 0.62%, compared with $219 million, or 0.38%, of total loans and leases. Classified\nloans totaled $2.1 billion, or 3.55%, compared with $769 million, or 1.35%, of total loans and leases.\nThe increases in nonperforming assets and classified loans were primarily in the commercial and industrial and term\nCRE portfolios. Classified loans increased primarily in the multifamily CRE loan portfolio as borrowers missed\nprojections due to lower-than-anticipated leasing, rent concessions, elevated costs, and higher interest rates. Our\nmultifamily CRE loan portfolio continues to benefit from strong underwriting, supported by high borrower equity and\nguarantor support.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, N.A.\nPress Release – Page 6\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds\n3Q24 - 2Q24 3Q24 - 3Q23\n(In millions) 3Q24 2Q24 3Q23 $ % $ %\nDeposits:\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 24,973 $ 24,731 $ 26,733 $ 242 1 % $ (1,760) (7) %\nInterest-bearing:\nSavings and money market 39,215 38,560 37,026 655 2 2,189 6\nTime 6,333 6,189 5,089 144 2 1,244 24\nBrokered 5,197 4,290 6,551 907 21 (1,354) (21)\nTotal interest-bearing 50,745 49,039 48,666 1,706 3 2,079 4\nTotal deposits $ 75,718 $ 73,770 $ 75,399 $ 1,948 3 $ 319 —\nBorrowed funds:\nFederal funds purchased and other short-term\nborrowings $ 2,919 $ 5,651 $ 4,346 $ (2,732) (48) $ (1,427) (33)\nLong-term debt 548 546 540 2 — 8 1\nTotal borrowed funds $ 3,467 $ 6,197 $ 4,886 $ (2,730) (44) $ (1,419) (29)\nTotal deposits increased $319 million from the prior year quarter, as a $2.1 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits\nwas partially offset by a $1.8 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.

Absent any sales or credit impairment of these securities, the unrealized losses will not be recognized in\nearnings. We do not intend to sell any securities with unrealized losses. Although changes in AOCI are reflected in\nshareholders’ equity, they are currently excluded from regulatory capital, and therefore do not impact our regulatory\ncapital ratios.\nEstimated common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital was $7.2 billion, an increase of 6%, compared with $6.8 billion in\nthe prior year period. The estimated CET1 capital ratio was 10.7%, compared with 10.2%. Tangible book value per\ncommon share increased to $33.12, compared with $25.75, primarily due to an increase in retained earnings and\nreduced unrealized losses in AOCI.

presents non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial measures. The adjustments\nto reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the\nfollowing schedules. We consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a\nmeaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our\nperformance and financial position. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors\nto assess our performance on the same basis as that applied by our management and the financial services industry.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not necessarily comparable to similar financial\nmeasures that may be presented by other financial services companies. Although non-GAAP financial measures are\nfrequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.\nTangible Common Equity and Related Measures\nTangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets\nand their related amortization. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our use of\nshareholders’ equity and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of a business more consistently, whether\nacquired or developed internally.\nRETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (NON-GAAP)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nNet earnings applicable to common shareholders\n(GAAP) $ 204 $ 190 $ 143 $ 116 $ 168\nAdjustments, net of tax:\nAmortization of core deposit and other intangibles 1 1 1 1 1\nAdjusted net earnings applicable to common\nshareholders, net of tax (a) $ 205 $ 191 $ 144 $ 117 $ 169\nAverage common equity (GAAP) $ 5,738 $ 5,450 $ 5,289 $ 4,980 $ 4,938\nAverage goodwill and intangibles (1,054) (1,056) (1,058) (1,060) (1,061)\nAverage tangible common equity (non-GAAP) (b) $ 4,684 $ 4,394 $ 4,231 $ 3,920 $ 3,877\nNumber of days in quarter (c) 92 91 91 92 92\nNumber of days in year (d) 366 366 366 365 365\nReturn on average tangible common equity (non- (a/b/\nGAAP) 1 c)*d 17.4 % 17.5 % 13.7 % 11.8 % 17.3 %\n1 Excluding the effect of AOCI from average tangible common equity would result in associated returns of 11.4%, 10.9%, 8.4%, 6.7%, and 9.9%\nfor the periods presented, respectively.\nZIONS BANCORPORATION, N.A.\nPress Release – Page 17\nTANGIBLE EQUITY RATIO, TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO, AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER\nCOMMON SHARE (ALL NON-GAAP MEASURES)\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nTotal shareholders’ equity (GAAP) $ 6,385 $ 6,025 $ 5,829 $ 5,691 $ 5,315\nGoodwill and intangibles (1,053) (1,055) (1,057) (1,059) (1,060)\nTangible equity (non-GAAP) (a) 5,332 4,970 4,772 4,632 4,255\nPreferred stock (440) (440) (440) (440) (440)\nTangible common equity (non-GAAP) (b) $ 4,892 $ 4,530 $ 4,332 $ 4,192 $ 3,815\nTotal assets (GAAP) $ 87,032 $ 87,606 $ 87,060 $ 87,203 $ 87,269\nGoodwill and intangibles (1,053) (1,055) (1,057) (1,059) (1,060)\nTangible assets (non-GAAP) (c) $ 85,979 $ 86,551 $ 86,003 $ 86,144 $ 86,209\nCommon shares outstanding (in thousands) (d) 147,699 147,684 147,653 148,153 148,146\nTangible equity ratio (non-GAAP) 1 (a/c) 6.2 % 5.7 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 4.9 %\nTangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP) (b/c) 5.7 % 5.2 % 5.0 % 4.9 % 4.4 %\nTangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) (b/d) $ 33.12 $ 30.67 $ 29.34 $ 28.30 $ 25.75\nEfficiency Ratio and Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue\nThe efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expense relative to revenue. We believe the efficiency ratio provides\nuseful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. We make adjustments to exclude certain items that are\nnot generally expected to recur frequently, as identified in the subsequent schedule, which we believe allows for more\nconsistent comparability across periods. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how we are managing\nour expenses. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue enables management and others to assess our ability to generate\ncapital. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows us to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources.\nEFFICIENCY RATIO (NON-GAAP) AND ADJUSTED PRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (NON-GAAP)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n(Dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nNoninterest expense (GAAP) (a) $ 502 $ 509 $ 526 $ 581 $ 496\nAdjustments:\nSeverance costs 1 1 — — —\nOther real estate expense, net — (1) — — —\nAmortization of core deposit and other intangibles 2 1 2 2 2\nRestructuring costs — — — — 1\nSBIC investment success fee accrual — 1 — — —\nFDIC special assessment — 1 13 90 —\nTotal adjustments (b) 3 3 15 92 3\nAdjusted noninterest expense (non-GAAP) (c)=(a-b) $ 499 $ 506 $ 511 $ 489 $ 493\nNet interest income (GAAP) (d) $ 620 $ 597 $ 586 $ 583 $ 585\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments (e) 12 11 10 10 11\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income (non-GAAP) (f)=(d+e) 632 608 596 593 596\nNoninterest income (GAAP) (g) 172 179 156 148 180\nCombined income (non-GAAP) (h)=(f+g) 804 787 752 741 776\nAdjustments:\nFair value and nonhedge derivative income (loss) (3) (1) 1 (9) 7\nSecurities gains (losses), net 9 4 (2) (1) 4\nTotal adjustments (i) 6 3 (1) (10) 11\nAdjusted taxable-equivalent revenue (non-GAAP) (j)=(h-i) $ 798 $ 784 $ 753 $ 751 $ 765\nPre-provision net revenue (PPNR) (non-GAAP) (h)-(a) $ 302 $ 278 $ 226 $ 160 $ 280\nAdjusted PPNR (non-GAAP) (j)-(c) 299 278 242 262 272\nEfficiency ratio (non-GAAP) 1 (c/j) 62.5 % 64.5 % 67.9 % 65.1 % 64.4 %\n1 Excluding both the $9 million gain on sale of our Enterprise Retirement Solutions business and the $4 million gain on sale of a bank-owned\nproperty (recorded in dividends and other income), the efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2024 would have been 65.6%."

          "content": "ZIONS\n2024 THIRD QUARTER\nFinancial Review\nOctober 21, 2024\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS; USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nForward Looking Information\nThis presentation includes “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions\nregarding future events or determinations, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, industry trends, and results\nor regulatory outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Forward-looking statements include, among others: Statements with respect to the beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, commitments,\ndesigns, guidelines, expectations, anticipations, and future financial condition, results of operations and performance of Zions Bancorporation, National Association and its subsidiaries (collectively “Zions Bancorporation,\nN.A.,” “the Bank,” “we,” “our,” “us”); and Statements preceded or followed by, or that include the words “may,” “might,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “forecasts,” “expect,”\n“intend,” “target,” “commit,” “design,” “plan,” “projects,” “will,” and the negative thereof and similar words and expressions.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees, nor should they be relied upon as representing management’s views as of any subsequent date. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those presented.\nAlthough the following list is not comprehensive, important factors that may cause material differences include: The quality and composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the quality and composition of our\ndeposits; Changes in general industry, political and economic conditions, including elevated inflation, economic slowdown or recession, or other economic challenges; changes in interest and reference rates, which could\nadversely affect our revenue and expenses, the value of assets and liabilities, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; deterioration in economic conditions that may result in increased loan and leases losses;\nThe effects of newly enacted and proposed regulations affecting us and the banking industry, as well as changes and uncertainties in applicable laws, and fiscal, monetary, regulatory, trade, and tax policies, and actions\ntaken by governments, agencies, central banks, and similar organizations, including those that result in decreases in revenue; increases in bank fees, insurance assessments and capital standards; and other regulatory\nrequirements; Competitive pressures and other factors that may affect aspects of our business, such as pricing and demand for our products and services, and our ability to recruit and retain talent; The impact of\ntechnological advancements, digital commerce, artificial intelligence, and other innovations affecting the banking industry; Our ability to complete projects and initiatives and execute on our strategic plans, manage our\nrisks, control compensation and other expenses, and achieve our business objectives; Our ability to develop and maintain technology, information security systems and controls designed to guard against fraud,\ncybersecurity, and privacy risks; Our ability to provide adequate oversight of our suppliers or prevent inadequate performance by third parties upon whom we rely for the delivery of various products and services; Natural\ndisasters, pandemics, catastrophic events and other emergencies and incidents and their impact on our and our customers’ operations and business and communities, including the increasing difficulty in, and the expense\nof, obtaining property, auto, business, and other insurance products; Governmental and social responses to environmental, social, and governance issues, including those with respect to climate change; Securities and\ncapital markets behavior, including volatility and changes in market liquidity and our ability to raise capital; The possibility that our recorded goodwill could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our\nearnings and shareholders’ equity; The impact of bank closures or adverse developments at other banks on general investor sentiment regarding the stability and liquidity of banks; Adverse news and other expressions of\nnegative public opinion whether directed at us, other banks, the banking industry, or otherwise that may adversely affect our reputation and that of the banking industry generally; Protracted congressional negotiations and\npolitical stalemates regarding government funding and other issues, including those that increase the possibility of government shutdowns, downgrades in United States (“U.S.”) credit ratings, or other economic disruptions;\nand The effects of wars and geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, and other local, national, or international disasters, crises, or conflicts that may occur in\nthe future.\nFactors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, industry trends, and results or regulatory outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements are\ndiscussed in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are available on our website (www.zionsbancorporation.com) and from the SEC (www.sec.gov).\nWe caution against the undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our views only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we specifically disclaim any obligation to update any\nfactors or to publicly announce the revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis document contains several references to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to, pre-provision net revenue and the “efficiency ratio,” which are common industry terms used by investors and financial\nservices analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions’ management compensation and are used in Zions’ strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors.\nTherefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A\nreconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the document, and users of this document are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.\n2\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nNet interest margin expanded for a third consecutive quarter while credit losses remain low\nKey Metrics 3Q24 2Q24\n• Net earnings to common improved by $14 million Net earnings to common $204 million $190 million\ndue to higher revenues and lower expenses\nDiluted earnings per share\n• Earning assets continued to reprice upward while $1.37 $1.28\n(GAAP)\nfunding costs remained flat, resulting in a 5-basis\npoint improvement in net interest margin Net Interest Margin 3.03% 2.98%\n• Net charge-offs were 0.02% of loans, annualized,\nEnding Average Ending Average\nand remain below peer median Loan growth (QoQ)\n0.8% 0.6% 0.5% 0.7%\n• Loss-absorbing capital continued to strengthen, with\nCustomer deposit growth (QoQ) Ending Average Ending Average\nthe CET1 ratio at 10.7%, up from 10.2% a year ago (excluding brokered) 1.5% 0.7% (0.7%) 0.3%\n• Improved efficiency ratio reflects both higher (annualized) (annualized)\nNet charge-offs / loans\nadjusted revenues and lower adjusted expenses 0.02% 0.10%\nduring the quarter\nReturn on average tangible\n17.4% 17.5%\ncommon equity1\nCommon equity tier 1% 10.7% 10.6%\nEfficiency ratio1 62.5% 64.5%\n3 (1) See Appendix for non-GAAP financial measures.\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nEarnings per share increased 7% over prior quarter from improved pre-provision net revenue, slightly offset by an increase in provision\nDiluted Earnings per Share Notable Items1:\n$1.37 3Q24:\n$1.28\n$1.13\n• No items with impact > $0.05 per share during the quarter\n$0.96\n$0.78 2Q24:\n• $0.07 per share positive impact from gains on sale of our Enterprise\nRetirement Solutions business and a bank-owned property\n1Q24:\n3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\n• $(0.07) per share negative impact from FDIC Special Assessment\nEPS Impact of Provision for Credit Losses\n4Q23:\n$-\n• $(0.46) per share negative impact from FDIC Special Assessment\n$(0.03)\n$(0.07) • $(0.05) per share negative impact from Credit Valuation Adjustment\n$(0.07)\n3Q23:\n• No items with impact > $0.05 per share during the quarter\n$(0.21)\n3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\n4 (1) Items that were $0.05 per share or more.\nPRE-PROVISION NET REVENUE (“PPNR”)\nLinked-quarter improvement in adjusted PPNR attributable to increased net interest income and lower adjusted noninterest expense\nLinked quarter (3Q24 vs. 2Q24)\n•\nAdjusted PPNR increased 8%:\n• Increased net interest income\n• Increased customer-related noninterest income\n• Decreased adjusted noninterest expense driven by\ndeclines in multiple categories\nYear-over-year (3Q24 vs. 3Q23)\n•\nAdjusted PPNR increased 10%:\n• Increase in net interest income due to growth in interest\nincome outpacing growth of funding costs\n• Slight increase in adjusted noninterest expense\n5 (1)PPNR includes taxable-equivalent revenue; Adjusted PPNR adjusts for items such as severance costs, restructuring costs, amortization of other\nintangibles, SBIC investment success fee accruals, FDIC special assessment, and securities gains (losses).
