(Nasdaq: MOND) (“Mondee” or the “Company”), a leading travel marketplace and artificial intelligence (AI) technology company, today announced financial results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“Mondee delivered a strong second quarter, with net revenue, take rate, and adjusted EBITDA up year over year—the latter by 38%. Our non-air component surged to 47% of net revenue and take rate grew 20 basis points to 8.6%,” said Founder, Chairman, and CEO Prasad Gundumogula.\n\n“We are also successfully refinancing our term loan and preferred equity, securing favorable terms that position Mondee for long-term growth. This new capital structure is expected to fuel our expansion, improve profitability, and solidify our AI leadership in travel,” Gundumogula continued.\n\n“We delivered net revenue of $58 million—up 3% year over year, or 11.5% adjusted for acquisitions and disposals—and maintained healthy adjusted EBITDA. Our much-anticipated refinancing is expected to provide Mondee with financial flexibility, and additional working capital, enabling the Company to resume and accelerate its growth trajectory,” said CFO Jesus Portillo.\n\n**Second Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Gross bookings** of $678.0 million for the quarter, approximately in line with the second quarter of 2023 (“Q2 23”). Our strategy of rapid growth in non-air and platform-driven international air expansion led to a strong 57% transaction growth with reduced average transaction price. This resulted in lower revenue growth and higher adjusted EBITDA.\n  * **Net revenues** of $58.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to $56.8 million in Q2 23. Delays in completing the refinancing caused a reduction in FinTech credit limits and working capital, materially limiting net revenue growth.\n  * **Net Loss** of $25.5 million for the quarter, including $19.1 million of non-cash and/or non-recurring items, such as $3.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.0 million of PIKed interest, $12.0 million of stock-based compensation, and $2.3 million amortization of loan origination fees, among others.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $6.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 38% compared to $4.4 million in Q2 23.\n  * **Operating****cash flow** used of $7.6 million for the quarter, compared to cash used of $2.4 million in Q2 23. In this quarter, the Company used over $10 million of cash reserves as working capital to offset for credit limit reductions by certain FinTech partners in the face of delays in refinancing of its term loan. The Company anticipates some of these credit limits to be reinstated as the refinancing is being completed. Year-to-date, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positive, $11.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Financial Summary and Operating Results****1,2**\n\n**For the three months ended June 30,**| **Year-Over-Year Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024**|  **2023**|  %  \nTransactions| 1,133,997| 721,464| 412,533| 57%  \nGross Bookings| $677,957| $679,244| $(1,287)| —%  \nNet Revenues| $58,326| $56,771| $1,555| 3%  \nNet Loss| $(25,512)| $(14,608)| $(10,904)| 75%  \nLoss per share (EPS)| $(0.36)| $(0.22)| $(0.14)| 63%  \nAdjusted EBITDA3| $6,111| $4,438| $1,673| 38%  \nAdjusted Loss per Share3| $(0.17)| $(0.09)| $(0.08)| 92%  \nNet cash used in operating activities| $(7,599)| $(2,427)| $(5,172)| (213)%  \n**For the six months ended June 30,**| **Year-Over-Year Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024**|  **2023**|  %  \nTransactions| 2,209,434| 1,386,637| 822,797| 59%  \nGross Bookings| $1,386,033| $1,347,323| $38,710| 3%  \nNet Revenues| $116,347| $106,700| $9,647| 9%  \nNet Loss| $(44,970)| $(27,523)| $(17,447)| 63%  \nLoss per share (EPS)| $(0.66)| $(0.43)| $(0.23)| 54%  \nAdjusted EBITDA3| $11,167| $8,595| $2,572| 30%  \nAdjusted Loss per Share3| $(0.32)| $(0.18)| $(0.14)| 74%  \nNet cash from (used in) operating activities| $11,062| $(12,406)| $23,468| (189)%  \n  \n**1** In $ thousands, except for Transactions and Loss per Share.**2** 2Q 2024 Net Loss included $19.1 million of non-cash and/or non-recurring items, such as $3.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.0 million of PIKed interest, $12.0 million of stock-based compensation and related payroll expense, and $2.3 million amortization of loan origination fees, and $0.1 million change in fair value of earn-out liabilities, among others. **3** Refer to section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Business Highlights and Subsequent Events**\n\n  * **Long-Term Refinancing.** The Company announced today a comprehensive refinancing of its capital structure with TCW and funds affiliated with Morgan Stanley Investment Management, that is expected to extend its term loan to June 30, 2028, and its preferred equity to December 31, 2028. The extended timing for the term loan beyond August 31, 2025 and the preferred equity beyond September 30, 2026, are both subject to securing a $15 million letter of credit that the Company anticipates finalizing shortly and which would provide additional working capital.\n\n\n\n**Revised****2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nOur fiscal year 2024 guidance, as a result of the impact of working capital and FinTech credit limit constraints caused by delays in completing the refinancing, is adjusted as follows:\n\n  * Net revenues of approximately $240 million to $250 million, representing an increase of 10% versus 2023 net revenues, measured at the midpoint.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $25 million to $30 million, representing an increase of 42% versus 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, measured at the midpoint.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nMondee will host a conference call Wednesday, August 14th at 5:30 a.m. (PT) / 7:30 a.m. (CT) / 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss its financial results with the investment community.

operating metrics that the Company believes are useful in providing additional information in assessing the overall performance of Mondee’s business.\n\nTransactions are defined as the number of travel reservations that were processed on Mondee’s platform during the period. A single transaction could include an airline ticket, a hotel or hospitality accommodation, and any number of ancillaries offered on the platform. Gross bookings are defined as the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel reservations through our platform between a third-party seller or service provider and the traveler, net of cancellations. Take rate is defined as revenues as a percentage of gross bookings. Mondee generates revenue from service fees earned on these transactions and, accordingly its revenue increases or decreases based on the increase or decrease in either or both the number or value of transactions Mondee processes. Revenue will increase as a result of the expansion in Mondee's distribution platform and/or as a result of an increase in service fees from higher value services offered on the platform.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this press release and the accompanying tables include the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per share.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is defined as net loss before 1) interest expense, net; 2) benefit (provision) for income taxes; 3) depreciation and amortization; 4) stock-based compensation expense; and 5) certain other expenses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.\n\n**Adjusted net loss** is defined as net loss before 1) stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense; 2) amortization of intangibles; 3) income tax benefit (provision); and 4) and certain other expenses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.\n\n**Adjusted net loss per share** is defined as adjusted net loss plus cumulative dividends allocated to preferred stockholders divided by the average number of basic or diluted (whichever is applicable) shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\n\nMondee believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users of this financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations. With respect to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss, Mondee believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s profitability relative to the amount of revenue generated, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses and/or non-cash expenses. Mondee also believes non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry, as these metrics eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation, which may vary for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nMondee uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of its overall assessment of the Company’s performance, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, and to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies. Mondee’s definition may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Thus, Mondee’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe

K6 Investments LLC\nNoor Sweid Pradeep Udhas Jeff Clarke\nFounder, General Partner, Co-Founder, Senior Advisor, CEO of Doxim, Former CEO\nGlobal Ventures KPMG India and Chairman of Travelport\nand Chairman of Orbitz\n34\nOperating Metrics\nThis press release also includes certain operating metrics that we believe are useful in providing additional information in assessing the overall performance of Mondee’s business.\nTransactions are defined as the number of travel reservations that were processed on Mondee’s platform during the period. A single transaction could include an airline ticket, a\nhotel or hospitality accommodation, and any number of ancillaries offered on the platform. Gross bookings are defined as the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees,\nof all travel reservations through our platform between a third-party seller or service provider and the traveler, net of cancellations. Take rate is defined as revenues as a percentage\nof gross bookings. Mondee generates revenue from service fees earned on these transactions and, accordingly its revenue increases or decreases based on the increase or decrease\nin either or both the number or value of transactions Mondee processes. Revenue will increase as a result of the expansion in Mondee's distribution platform and/or as a result of an\nincrease in service fees from higher value services offered on the platform.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), this press release and the\naccompanying tables include the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before 1) interest expense, net; 2) benefit (provision) for income taxes; 3) depreciation and amortization; 4) stock-based compensation\nexpense; and 5) certain other expenses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss before 1) stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense; 2) amortization of intangibles; 3) income tax benefit (provision); and 4)\nand certain other expenses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.\nAdjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss plus cumulative dividends allocated to preferred stockholders divided by the average number of basic or diluted\n(whichever is applicable) common shares outstanding during the period.\nMondee believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users of this financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial\nperformance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations. With respect to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss, Mondee believes these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s profitability relative to the amount of revenue generated, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and\ncertain other expenses and/or non-cash expenses. Mondee also believes non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other\ncompanies in its industry, as these metrics eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation, which may vary for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nMondee uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of its overall assessment of the Company’s performance, including the\npreparation of its annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, and to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies. Mondee’s definition may differ from the definitions\nused by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Thus, Mondee’s non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables provides key metrics and a detailed reconciliation (unaudited) of adjusted EBITDA:\n1Adjusted EBITDA has been conformed to the current period presentation for period over period comparability.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n1Adjusted EBITDA has been conformed to the current period presentation for period over period comparability.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table (unaudited) reconciles net loss to Adjusted Net Loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles net loss per share to Adjusted Net Loss per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:"

Welcome to Mondee's second quarter 2024\nconference call. With me today is our Founder, Chairman, and CEO, Prasad Gundumogula; and\nChief Financial Officer, Jesus Portillo, Executive Vice Chairman, Orestes Fintiklis; and Chief\nOperating Officer, Jim Dullum will present our results and be available for questions and\nanswers.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking\nstatements including statements about revenue, growth of our business, our management and\ngovernance plans, and other non-historical statements as further described in our press release.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions,\nincluding those related to Mondee's growth, the evolution of our industry, our product\ndevelopment and success, our management performance and general economic and business\nconditions.\nWe undertake no obligation to revise any statements to reflect changes that occur after this call.\nDescriptions of these and other risks that could cause actual results to have a material\ndifference from these forward-looking statements are discussed in our reports filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and in our earnings press release that was issued this\nmorning. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Listeners are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, we also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the most\ncomparable GAAP measures are also available in the press release, which is available at\ninvestors.mondee.com.\nWith that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over, Prasad?\nPrasad Gundumogula\nThank you, Jeff. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everyone and welcome to\nMondee's second quarter 2024 earnings call to discuss our results and significant\ndevelopments.\nWe are very pleased to report a strong second quarter with growth in net revenue, take rate,\nand adjusted EBITDA, the latter by 38% year over year. We also announced the much-\nanticipated refinancing of our term loan and preferred equity at favorable terms that will position\nthe Company for long-term success.\nLooking more closely, we are encouraged by our improved take rate, which increased 20 basis\npoints to 8.6%, reflecting the positive impact of our product mix expanding into non-air. During\nQ2 2024, our non-air net revenue mix increased to 47% from 42% in Q2 2023.\nMondee's growth in transactions, net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, along with our platform-\ndriven expansion in global markets, positions us well for continued market-share penetration.\nWe are confident that the ongoing integration of acquired businesses and the growth of our\ninternational markets will contribute to faster sustained revenue increases.\nWe are refinancing our capital structure with favorable terms that position the Company for long-\nterm success. With the longer duration to both the term loan and preferred equity, Mondee\nanticipates having the flexibility and financial resources to execute on its transformative plans.\nThese plans are expected to increase revenue, profitability, and free cash flows while continuing\nto lead AI-innovation in travel.\nI now turn the floor over to Jim Dullum, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss some business\ntrends and Mondee initiatives underpinning our results and outlook.\nJim Dullum\nThank you Prasad and good day everyone.\nBusiness Drivers and Our Marketplace Enhancements\nThe longer-term growth trend for travel remains intact, however we saw the beginnings of\nindustry softening by the end of the second quarter that we expect to continue into 2025.\nFurthermore, certain regions experienced disruptive events in Q2, such as catastrophic flooding\nin South America affecting LATAM travel and the re-escalating Middle East conflict.\nWhile a few stronger regional markets remain from the last vestiges of the recovery, the overall\nmoderation in demand is being accompanied by a reduction of air fares and decline in lodging\nrates. In addition, global inflation and economic conditions are spurring an increase in buyer\nbargain hunting, to include higher-income consumers. Meanwhile, suppliers, already under\nservice-related pressure, are expected to continue emphasizing product differentiation,\npackaging and more targeted distribution as keys to potential growth. We expect more\nemphasis to be placed on supplier driven programs, such as expanding NDC and direct\nconnections.\nWhile the market softness may have a short-term impact on the remainder of this year, we\nbelieve these overall conditions significantly favor Mondee’s B2B marketplace expansion and\ndeployment of our emerging AI platforms.\nExpansion and Enhancements in the Mondee Marketplace\nTurning to the Mondee Marketplace, during Q2 we capitalized on international expansion\nthrough our platform, delivering a 57% increase in transactions year-over-year. This growth\ncould have been higher had it not been for the working capital constraints mentioned previously.\nOur strategy of expanding in non-air product mix with higher take rate, and growth in\ntransactions in international markets, overcame the pricing effect on gross bookings, producing\nnet revenue growth and solid Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe strong increase in transactions was accompanied by flat year-over-year gross bookings as\na result of lower average transaction values, primarily driven by our rapid growth in lower-priced\ninternational markets. We plan to continue our penetration in international markets through\ndeployment of our global marketplace platform.\nWe continued to make progress during the second quarter on initiatives around boosting\nprofitability, expanding our travel marketplace, and maintaining AI leadership. Our ongoing focus\nis to significantly enhance our content, accelerate our sales penetration in existing and new\nmarkets, as well as further streamline our business infrastructure and cost structure as noted on\nslide #7.\nIn the area of content enhancement, we continue expanding packages and product\ncombinations, while adding new features and options. This is expected to enhance the appeal of\nour offerings and improve sales performance across Mondee’s growing transaction base. In\naddition, as Jesus will cover later, we expect to ramp up the use of our FinTech FinTech tools\nand content to further increase customer engagement, take rate, and net revenue.\nFurther highlights of our progress include enhanced supplier connect programs such as airline\nNDC connections, direct connections with major hotel chains, and with several others in our\nimmediate international expansion pipeline. With these in place, we are seeing more traffic on\nour NDC connections with improved product pricing and features, as well as material\nimprovement in our hotel take-rate and conversions. A more specific example is an increase of\nover 50% in our North America hotel take rate so far this year.\nIn summary, as we look into the rest of the year, we are moving from market planning and\ndevelopment to continued platform deployment and business execution. Our focus initiatives\ninclude further implementation of AI tools in Mondee’s operations, product expansion for greater\nmarket appeal, enhanced revenue management, and AI automation-led process improvement\nwith further cost efficiency. In addition, we are positioned to take full advantage of all our\nFinTech tools and services that will no longer be capacity constrained. All of these initiatives for\nrapid business expansion and further operational efficiency are expected to put Mondee\nsquarely inline with our historic growth path and profitability goals by the end of the year, despite\nmarket softness.\nI now pass the call over to Jesus, our CFO, for a review of Mondee's financial performance and\noutlook. Jesus?\nJesus Portillo\nThank you, Jim, and hello everyone.\nAs I go over our Q2 results, I would like to point out that all growth rates are on a year-over-year\nbasis, unless otherwise indicated.\nLet me start with our Financial Highlights\nDuring this quarter, we continued to generate strong performance around net revenue, EBITDA,\nand EBITDA margin.\nAs part of our core marketplace strategy, our focus has been to 1) diversify our product offering\nbeyond air, which improves take rate, 2) expand internationally, and 3) continue to grow in\nexisting markets.\nDuring the first half of this year, we continued to diversify our product offering and accelerating\nour international air expansion, which led to a 57% increase in transactions that carry a lower\naverage transaction price. At the same time, as a result of delayed refinancing and working\ncapital constraints, we moderated growth of our existing business that required working capital\nto grow. This resulted in flat gross bookings, lower than usual net revenue growth, and improved\nadjusted EBITDA.\nOur Gross Bookings were $678 million in this quarter, in line with last year.\nOur Net Revenue of $58 million increased 3%. After adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures of\nlast year, net revenue grew 11.5%.\nOur Take Rate of 8.6% was up 20 basis points. As with prior quarters, this improvement in Take\nRate was driven mostly by the growth of higher-margin hotel and package products. It is worth\nmentioning that the delay in our refinancing impacted our ability to fully utilize our credit limits,\nresulting in lower FinTech revenue which carries the highest Take Rate. We expect this to be\nfully resolved with our refinancing.\nTurning to expenses, our largest expense category, Sales & Marketing, keep improving and was\ndown 5% in absolute terms while it declined from 71% to 65% as a percentage of Net Revenue.\nThe main drivers for this improvement continue to be AI driven optimization of our revenue\nmanagement and reductions in performance marketing spent in our B2C business.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 38%, from $4.4 million to $6.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin\nalso increased from 7.8% to 10.5%, as we continue to prioritize operating efficiencies and\nimprove profitability.\nOn a GAAP basis, our net loss was $25.5 million, which included $19.1 million of non-cash\nand/or non-recurring items, such as $3.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.0 million\nof PIKed interest, $12.0 million of stock-based compensation, and $2.3 million amortization of\nloan origination fees, among others.\nLooking at our balance sheet, at the end of this quarter we had $32 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, and $169 million of total debt, compared to $36 million and $162 million,\nrespectively, at the end of December 2023.\nWe announced today a comprehensive refinancing of our capital structure with TCW and funds\naffiliated with Morgan Stanley, that is expected to extend the term loan to June 30, 2028, and\nthe preferred equity to December 31, 2028. The extended timing for the term loan beyond\nAugust 31, 2025 and the preferred equity beyond September 30, 2026, are both subject to\nsecuring a $15 million letter of credit that the Company anticipates finalizing shortly and which\nwould provide additional working capital.\nOperating cash flow was negative $7.6 million for the quarter, compared to negative $2.4 million\nin Q2 23. In this quarter, we used over $10 million of cash reserves as working capital to offset\nfor credit limit reductions by certain FinTech partners in the face of delays in refinancing of our\nterm loan. We anticipate some of these credit limits to be reinstated as the refinancing is being\ncompleted. Year-to-date, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positive, $11.1\nmillion and $3.3 million, respectively.\nTurning now to our 2024 Guidance\nAs a consequence of the limitations we described, we now forecast our net revenue to be\nbetween $240 million and $250 million, representing an increase of 10% versus 2023 net\nrevenue, measured at the midpoint and Adjusted EBITDA to be between $25 million to $30\nmillion, representing an increase of 42% versus 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, measured at the\nmidpoint."

These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, previously filed with the SEC.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including acquired\nbusinesses from the dates of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. For international operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of\nexchange existing at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts are translated at monthly average exchange rates applicable for the period. Translation\ngains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign\ncurrency transaction gains and losses are included in other expense, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our\nestimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results could significantly differ from those\nestimates.\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash\nequivalents consist of cash on hand, highly liquid investments in money market funds and various deposit accounts.\nThe Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related to letters of credit intended to secure payments for the purchase of airline tickets in\nthe ordinary course of business. We have placed short-term certificates of deposits with financial institutions as collateral under these arrangements and\naccordingly, these balances are presented as restricted cash and short-term investments of $9.0 million and $8.0 million on the consolidated balance sheets as of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets to the total\namounts presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\n10\nTable of Contents\nJune 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 23,337 $ 27,994\nRestricted cash presented in restricted cash and short-term investments 7,648 6,672\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 30,985 $ 34,666\nAccounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable from customers are recorded at the original invoiced amounts net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We make estimates of\nexpected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss\nhistory continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of\nfuture economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The provision for estimated credit losses is recorded in\naccounts receivable, net of allowance on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract assets represent unbilled and accrued incentive revenues from airline companies and our GDS service providers based on the achievement of\ncontractual targets defined at contract inception. The provision for estimated credit losses is recorded in contract assets, net of allowance on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain of $0.1 million to provision for credit losses, net, due to revision of estimates of\nexpected credit losses on accounts receivables and contract assets and wrote off a total $1.5 million in accounts receivables.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines, dependence on\nthird-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. We also rely on GDS service\nproviders and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contract assets and accounts receivable.\nSignificant concentrations are those that represent more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue, total accounts receivable, or total contract assets. As of\nJune 30, 2024, there were two financial institutions with other receivable balances that accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable and there\nwere two customers with contract asset balances that accounted for more than 10% of total contract assets.

The earn-out\nconsiderations are fair valued using the Monte Carlo Method and is a Level 3 measurement because the Company estimates projections during the earn-out\nperiod utilizing various potential pay-out scenarios. The Monte Carlo simulation method repeats a process thousands of times in an attempt to predict all the\npossible future outcomes. At the end of the simulation, several random trials produce a distribution of outcomes that are then analyzed to determine the average\npresent value of the earn-out liability. The valuation model utilized the following assumptions for the valuation of the earn-out liabilities as of June 30, 2024:\nOrinter Interep Consolid Skypass\nCost of equity 20.9 % 26.9 % 28.0 % 20.9 %\nEBITDA volatility 57.0 % 57.0 % 34.0 % 59.0 %\nEquity volatility 88.0 % 88.0 % 68.0 % 89.0 %\nRequired metric risk premium 13.5 % 17.5 % 11.5 % 14.0 %\nRisk-neutral adjustment factor 0.88 - 0.97 0.85 - 0.96 0.97 0.81 - 0.99\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2024, it was determined that Orinter and Interep achieved the first of multiple operating metrics specified in the purchase\nagreement and, as a result, a portion of earn-out consideration was transferred to Level 1 as earn-out payable given the certainty of payments. In April 2024, the\nCompany paid out $3.3 million and $1.0 million for Orinter and Interep earn-out considerations, respectively.\nThe Level 3 earn-out consideration is recorded in earn-out liability, net, current portion and earn-out liability, net, excluding current portion on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges to the unobservable inputs do not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business. Although the results of litigation and claims\ncannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on its business.\nRegardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs, diversion of management\nresources, and other factors. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has the following outstanding legal claims that may have a material impact.\nLitigation Relating to LBF Acquisition. Thomas DeRosa, a shareholder of LBF Travel Management Corp. (f/k/a LBF Travel, Inc.), the entity that sold LBF\nTravel Holdings, LLC to Mondee, sued LBF Travel Management Corp. and its CEO to recover a portion of the proceeds of the sale of LBF Travel Holdings,\nLLC to Mondee. Mondee was later added as a party to this litigation via a third-party complaint that alleges, among other things, that Mondee aided and\nabetted the directors and officers of LBF Travel Management Corp. in breaches of their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The Federal Court\nrecently dismissed these specific claims against Mondee, and limited other claims in the case, but has not yet set a trial date. There is a separate state court\naction that has been stayed. While the Company believes that they will be successful based on their position, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that the\nCompany could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the assessment and an estimate for a reasonably possible range of loss of\nany such payments cannot be made.\nLitigation Relating to Restrictive Legends. On December 8, 2023, plaintiff Raja Venkatesh (“Venkatesh”) filed a complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Prasad Gundumogula (“Gundumogula” and,\ntogether with the Company, the “Mondee\n26\nTable of Contents\nDefendants”), and the Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“CST”). The complaint, which is captioned Raja Venkatesh v.\nMondee Holdings, Inc., Prasad Gundumogula, and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Case No.: 1:23-cv-10734-VEC (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Venkatesh\nAction”), asserts ten causes of action: (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against the Mondee Defendants; (2)\nviolation of 8 Del. C. § 158 against Mondee and CST; (3) violation of 8 Del. C. §§ 8-401 and 8-407 against Mondee and CST; (4) breach of fiduciary duty\nagainst the Mondee Defendants; (5) negligence against Mondee and CST; (6) conversion against Mondee and CST; (7) civil conspiracy against all Defendants;\n(8) breach of contract against Mondee; (9) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against Mondee; and (10) injunction against the\nCompany and CST. The claims asserted in the Venkatesh Action all relate to Plaintiff’s allegations that the Company improperly placed and maintained certain\nrestrictive legends on his shares of common stock in the Company purportedly in violation of the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement, to which Plaintiff\nand the Company are parties. The relief sought in the complaint includes a permanent injunction requiring the removal of the restrictive legends, compensatory\ndamages for losses allegedly sustained by Venkatesh as a result of defendants’ conduct, punitive damages, and costs and expenses incurred in connection with\nthe Venkatesh Action. On February 12, 2024, the Mondee Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure\nto state a claim. In addition, Gundumogula moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Also on February 12, 2024, CST filed a motion to\ndismiss the complaint. Plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to Mondee Defendants’ and CST’s motions to dismiss on April 11, 2024. In his\nopposition, Plaintiff withdrew his claims for violation of 6 Del. C. § 8-401 (Count III) and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count\nIX) as against all defendants, his claim for civil conspiracy as against Gundumogula (Count VII), and breach of fiduciary duty as against Mondee (Count IV).\nAdditionally, Plaintiff clarified that his claim for injunction (Count X) is not a cause of action, but rather a request for injunctive relief as a remedy if successful\non his other claims. The pretrial conference, which was originally scheduled for February 9, 2024, has been adjourned pending resolution of the pending\nmotions to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claims asserted in the Venkatesh Action. At present, the Company is unable to reasonably\nestimate a possible range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.\nOn October 13, 2021, Mondee received a summons from Global Collect Services B.V. to appear in the District Court of Amsterdam with respect to a claim\nof $0.5 million for past dues and outstanding invoices, fees, plus interest and costs of collection. The Company is in current discussions to settle this lawsuit\nand at this time the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company had $7.7 million and $7.9 million secured letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These\nprimarily relate to securing the payment for the potential purchase of airline tickets in the ordinary course of business and are collateralized by term deposits,\nfor which the contractual obligation is less than a year.\nCommercial Commitments\nThe Company has commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business of the industry in which it operates. Under the terms of such\ncontracts, the Company receives cash in advance for production goals over a period of several years. In the event of under-performance or termination of the\napplicable contract, the Company may be obligated to repay amounts still to be earned.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have the following reportable segments: Travel Marketplace and SaaS Platform. These reportable segments offer different products and services and\nare managed separately because the nature of products and services, and methods used to distribute the services are different. Our primary segment measure is\nAdjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). Assets, liabilities, income tax expense and certain other expenses are\nreviewed on an entity-wide basis by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), and hence are not allocated to these reportable segments.

INCOME TAXES\nWe have assessed our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and have recorded a valuation allowance against such assets to the extent that, based on the\nweight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the likelihood of future\nrealization of our deferred tax assets, we placed significant weight on our history of generating tax losses. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance\nagainst substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We expect to maintain a valuation allowance in such\njurisdictions for the foreseeable future.\nWe determine our benefit (provision) for income taxes for interim periods using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate. We record any changes\naffecting the estimated annual effective tax rate in the interim period in which the change occurs, including discrete items. The tax expense arising on account\nof tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets and state minimum taxes is calculated based on the discrete approach.\nThe Company recorded a $0.2 million liability for an income tax contingency related to the acquisition of Interep. At the date of acquisition, we recognized\nan indemnification asset at the same time and on the same basis as the recognized liability, to the extent that collection is reasonably assured, in accordance\nwith ASC 805.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of our effective income tax rate:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoss before income taxes $ (25,516) $ (12,600) $ (44,329) $ (24,816)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (4) 2,008 641 2,707\nEffective income tax rate 0.02 % (15.94)% (1.45)% (10.91)%\nThe effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances on the Company’s deferred tax assets as it is more\nlikely than not that some or all of the Company’s deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as described below, the Company did not identify any additional subsequent events that\nwould have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOn July 12, July 19, July 26, 2024 and August 2, 2024, the Company executed the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth amendments to the\nTerm Loan, respectively. The amendments provided payment extensions for refinancing fees, principal and interest while the Company works to finalize a\nlong-term facility with various lenders on the Term Loan.\nOn August 14, 2024, the Company executed the twenty-first amendment (“Twenty-first Amendment”) to the Term Loan. The amendment provided for the\nfollowing terms: (1) extension of the Term Loan and TCW LOC maturity date to August 31, 2025 and provide that the maturity date will be automatically\nextended to June 30, 2028 if the Company executes a letter of credit facility in the aggregate face amount of $15.0 million (“L/C Facility”); (2) additional term\nloans with net proceeds of $5.0 million contingent on the closing of the L/C Facility; (3) specifies the timing of payments of principal and interest on the Term\nLoan, waives a portion of the July 31, 2024 refinancing fees, and removes the requirement to pay refinancing fees on the outstanding Term Loan balance after\nJuly 31, 2024; (4) specifies additional amendment fees associated with the Term Loan; and (5) amends certain financial covenants of the Term Loan.\nOn August 14, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), the Company executed an amended and restated the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and\nLimitations of Series A-1, Series A-2 and Series A-3 Preferred Stock. The amendment will become effective upon the Company meeting certain contingency\nconditions, including the execution of the L/C Facility as well as the Company's receipt of Term Loan proceeds from the Twenty-first Amendment of the Term\nLoan (the first date upon which all such conditions shall have been satisfied being hereinafter referred to as the “Amendment Effective Date”). Following the\nAmendment Effective Date, the amendment extends the put right date on the Company’s preferred stock to December 31, 2028, and removes the provision that\naccelerates the put right date to March 31, 2026 in the event the Company does not achieve at least $50.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2025.\nThe amendment also includes quarterly financial covenants for the outstanding shares of preferred stock. In conjunction with preferred stock amendment, the\nCompany executed a warrant agreement for the issuance of common stock warrants for up to 10% of shares of common stock outstanding as of the Closing\nDate. These common stock warrants are to be issued on specified dates on or after the Amendment Effective Date and at various strike prices, based on terms\ngoverning the warrant agreement.\n33\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Our Marketplace has achieved nearly $3 billion of annual gross bookings, primarily in the leisure travel market segment\noriginating in North America with international destinations. In addition to our technology platform and marketplace, our competitive moat includes: a Global\nContent Hub of negotiated rate content from airlines, hotels, cruise lines and other suppliers; a growing Distribution Network of 65,000 travel experts and\nintermediaries; Abhi, a travel industry leading AI-assisted user experience and process management application; a suite of profitable Ancillary and FinTech\nsolutions; and in-house multi-lingual 24/7 Support and Service Delivery centers. Our competitive cornerstones and continued growth are further complemented\nby a history of successfully acquiring and integrating twenty travel companies with complementary content, distribution, and/or technology into our\ntechnology-enabled ecosystem.\nWe provide a state-of-the-art AI platform, in addition to technologies, apps, operating systems and services that seamlessly facilitate travel transactions, as\nwell as the creation of personalized experiences. These platforms are deployed to better serve travelers through travel experts and numerous other emerging\nchannels. Our AI-enabled technology solutions provide the necessary modern traveler engagement services such as collaborative conversational commerce,\nseamless connectivity and 24/7 assistance, as well as operating systems with modern financial technology, insurance and marketing services. These technology\nsolutions facilitate access to highly perishable global travel content and extensive negotiated travel content, and combined with our distribution network,\ncreating a compelling Travel Marketplace.\nWe are increasingly focused on rapidly expanding our global presence in, and penetration of, the broader travel market. In addition to the rapid\ndevelopment and enhancement of our modern Travel Marketplace, we are increasingly focused on expanding our penetration of the “gig economy” segment of\nthe travel market. We believe our technology solutions are well-suited to serve gig workers seeking more flexibility, diverse content and travel services.\nFrom the date of founding, our Company began building a leading international wholesale travel business through acquisitions and deployment of our\ntechnology platform. We expect to continue pursuing strategic opportunities that strengthen our technology solutions, expand the breadth and depth of our\ncontent, and grow our distribution network globally. From recent acquisitions, we have grown our content of hotel and lodging, cruise and tour offerings and\nplan to expand our travel and experiences packaging capabilities through acquisition candidates with this expertise. Additionally, we expect to increase the\nCompany's international footprint by acquiring distributors, aggregators and platforms beyond North America and Latin America.\nWe believe the successful execution of our accretive and synergistic acquisition business strategy has enhanced our modern Travel Marketplace and\npositions us well for emerging travel business opportunities.\nWe generate revenue primarily from travel-related activity, which is presented as Travel Marketplace segment revenue on the disaggregated revenue\ndisclosure within Note 4 — Revenue, of our condensed consolidated financial statements. The Travel Marketplace segment includes revenue earned from:\n• Commissions revenue, including mark-up fees and commissions on airline ticket sales and to a lesser extent, on hotel accommodations and booking of\ncar rentals, and other travel services;\n• Incentive revenues earned from GDS service providers and airline companies for airline reservations, as well as from our fintech payment programs\nbased on the aggregate gross booking amounts processed by us; and\n• Other travel products and services.\nThe remainder of our revenues are generated from subscription contracts for access to our travel management software-as-a service (“SaaS”) platforms.\nOur SaaS Platform revenues are recognized over the term of the contract.\nMacroeconomic Considerations\nWeakening conditions in the economy, from rising interest rates and inflation, for example, both in the United States and abroad, may negatively our\nresults of operations. For further discussion on the impact of macroeconomic factors to our business, financial condition and operating results, refer to the\nsection “Risk Factors”.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nAdverse changes in general market conditions for travel services, including the effects of macroeconomic conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters,\nhealth concerns, civil or political unrest or other events outside our control could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur revenue is derived from the global travel industry and would be significantly impacted by declines in, or disruptions to, travel activity, particularly air\ntravel. Global factors over which we have no control, but which could impact our clients’ willingness to travel and, depending on the scope and duration, cause\na significant decline in travel volumes include, among other things:\n• widespread health concerns, epidemics or pandemics;\n• global security concerns caused by terrorist attacks, the threat of terrorist attacks, or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks, including\nelevated threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of travel;\n• cyber-terrorism, political unrest, the outbreak of hostilities or escalation or worsening of existing hostilities or war;\n• natural disasters or severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, flooding and earthquakes;\n• climate change-related impact to travel destinations, such as extreme weather, natural disasters and disruptions, and actions taken by governments,\nbusinesses and supplier partners to combat climate change;\n• the occurrence of travel-related accidents or the grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns;\n• adverse changes in visa and immigration policies or the imposition of travel restrictions or more restrictive security procedures; and\n• any decrease in demand for consumer or business travel could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur operating results are impacted by our ability to manage costs and expenses, while achieving a balance between making appropriate investments to\ngrow revenue and increase profitability.\nCost and expense management will have a direct impact on our financial performance. We may look to drive revenue growth through investments in\nmarketing, technology, and acquisitions to increase our net revenue, product offerings, revenue per transaction, and ultimately market share. These investments\nwill need to be weighed against creating a more cost-efficient business to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating Metrics\nOur financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the business activity generated by our travel-related services. Transactions\nrepresent the number of travel reservations that were processed on Mondee’s platform during the period. Gross bookings are defined as the total dollar value,\ngenerally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel reservations through our platform between a third-party seller or service provider and the traveler booking on\nour platform, net of cancellations. Revenue may increase as a result of an increase in the number of travelers booking on our platform or as a result of an\nincrease in service fees from higher value services offered on the platform. Take rate is defined as revenues as a percentage of gross bookings.\nWe consider these operating metrics to correlate to our commission revenues and incentive revenues recognized, and are therefore, useful units of\nmeasurement for investors. We also use these operating metrics as part of our overall assessment of the Company’s operational performance and for its\npreparation of operating budget and forecasts.\nTransactions, gross bookings and take rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTransactions 1,134 721 2,209 1,387\nGross bookings $ 677,957 $ 679,244 $ 1,385,992 $ 1,347,323\nTake rate 8.6 % 8.4 % 8.4 % 7.9 %\n36\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operation\nRevenues, Net\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our Travel Marketplace segment wherein Travel Transaction Revenues are earned by providing online travel\nreservation services on behalf of our travel product vendors to travelers, and Fintech Program Revenues are earned from banks and financial institutions based\non the travel booking spend processed through fintech programs partnered with our platform.\nOur Travel Transaction Revenue includes mark-up fees, commissions and incentives, and is recorded net of estimated cancellation and refunds. Our mark-\nup fees and certain commissions are earned at ticketing, as our performance obligation is satisfied upon issuance of the ticket or reservation details to the\ntraveler. We also earn certain commissions and incentives per booking when the underlying trip is taken by the traveler. Our Travel Transaction Revenues are\nall priced on a per booking basis, where the commission and incentive rates could be either flat fees or tiered fixed percentages and are subject to frequent\nmodifications in a dynamic market. From time to time, we issue credits or refunds to the traveler in the event of cancellations. At ticketing, when a travel\nbooking service is performed and our single performance obligation has been fulfilled, we make an estimate for variable consideration based on cumulative\nbooking, which is calculated per applicable pricing tier. Additionally, when the same travel booking is processed, we make an estimate for variable\nconsideration for the traveler taking the trip, to the extent that there is a risk of significant reversal constraining the variable consideration, until the trip is\ntaken, since the occurrence of the trip can be influenced by outside factors, such as the actions of travelers and weather conditions. We recognize Fintech\nProgram Revenues at a point in time when the payment of the trip booked by traveler is settled through the fintech program partnered with our Company.\nWe also generate revenue by providing subscription-based platform access that offers businesses and consumers the ability to purchase travel services\ndirectly on the platform.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with\nmerchant transactions; (2) advertising and affiliate marketing costs; (3) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, fraud\nprotection services, and other services; (4) customer relation costs; and (5) customer chargeback provisions.\nWe rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of (1)\nadvertising, which are expensed as incurred and consist of digital and physical advertising; and (2) affiliate marketing programs.\nWe utilize affiliate marketing to promote travel product sales and generate bookings through our website and platform. Our platform provides affiliates\nwith technology and access to a wide range of products and services. We pay commission to third-party affiliates for the bookings originated through our\nwebsite and platform based on targeted merchandising and promotional strategies implemented by us from time to time. We intend to continue making\nsignificant investments in marketing to drive additional revenue, increase our market share, and expand our global customer base. As a result, we expect our\nmarketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expect to invest in growing and training our sales force and broadening our brand awareness.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) occupancy and office expenses; (2) fees for outside professionals, including legal and\naccounting services; (3) audit and tax fees; and (4) other miscellaneous expenses, including changes in the fair value of acquisition earn-outs. We expect to\nincur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC and stock exchange listing standards, additional insurance expenses (including directors’ and officers’ insurance), investor relations\nactivities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to\n37\nTable of Contents\nincrease the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business. However, we anticipate general and administrative expenses\nto decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nPersonnel Expenses\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, and employee health and other benefits, as well as\nstock-based compensation expense. We expect to incur additional personnel expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expanding head\ncount through organic growth as well as increasing headcount through mergers and acquisitions. However, we anticipate personnel expenses to decrease as a\npercentage of revenue over the long term.\nInformation Technology Expenses\nInformation Technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) software license and system maintenance fees; (2) outsourced data center and web hosting\ncosts; (3) payments to contractors; and (4) data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services. We expect to incur additional\nInformation Technology expenses as a result of expanding our operations through growth of our online booking platform in order to support the growth of our\nbusiness. However, we anticipate Information Technology expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of: (1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2) amortization of internally\ndeveloped and purchased software; and (3) depreciation of furniture, computer equipment and office equipment. We expect to incur additional depreciation and\namortization expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expanding our operations through capital expenditures and purchases of long-\nlived assets, as well as potential impacts of our continued mergers and acquisitions strategy. However, we anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to\ndecrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of: (1) interest income; (2) interest expense; (3) other income and expense, (4) changes in the fair value of our\nprivate placement warrant liability, and (5) net expenses incurred on the divestiture of LBF Travel Inc, LBF Travel Holdings LLC, Avia Travel and Tours Inc,\nand Star Advantage Limited (collectively, “LBF US”) and LBF US transition services. Other income and expense includes realized gains and losses on foreign\ncurrency and our foreign currency derivative instruments.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to payment of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and other forms of income taxes in other jurisdictions. Consequently, we determine\nour consolidated benefit (provision) for income taxes based on tax obligations incurred using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the condensed consolidated financial statements and income tax bases of\nassets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when, based on the weight of\navailable evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nWe evaluate uncertain tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that such tax positions would be sustained upon examination. We record a\nliability when such uncertainties fail to meet the more likely than not threshold.\nA U.S. shareholder is subject to current tax on “global intangible low-taxed income” (“GILTI”) of its controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”). We are\nsubject to tax under GILTI provisions and include our CFCs’ income in our U.S. income tax benefit (provision) in the period that the CFCs earn the income.\n38\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nWe have derived this data from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

The increase was primarily\ndriven by the expanded market and business associated with the acquisitions of Orinter Tour & Travel, S.A. (“Orinter”), Interep Representações Viagens E\nTurismo S.A. (“Interep”), Consolid Mexico Holding, S.A. P.I. de C.V. (“Consolid”), and Skypass Travel Inc, Skypass Travel de Mexico Sa de CV, Skypass\nTravel Private Limited and Skypass Holidays, LLC (collectively, “Skypass”), during 2023 on our integrated technology platform. This was partially offset from\nrevenue lost of approximately $9.5 million from the sale of LBF. Because we merged customers and supplier relationships from the business acquisitions into\nconsolidated operations, separating revenues specifically from these acquired entities becomes impractical.\nThe revenues, net increase is primarily contributed by our Travel Marketplace segment. The revenue growth in our Travel Marketplace segment in 2024\nwas limited by working capital constraints as a result of our Term Loan refinancing activities in the current quarter. Due to this, we were not able to fully utilize\nthe Fintech Program and accommodate transactions that could have generated higher gross bookings. Despite these limitations, revenue increased by $1.4\nmillion or 2% and compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of commission revenues earned from mark-up fees on airline ticket sales,\ntravel packages, hotel accommodations, and other travel products and travel services.\nThe revenue growth in our Travel Marketplace segment in 2024 was primarily impacted by a 57% increase in the number of transactions processed in our\nTravel Marketplace during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Refer to our Factors Affecting Our Performance –\nOperating Metrics for further details.\nOperating Expenses and Other (Income) Expense\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $2.0 million or 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.8 million in advertising and marketing expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the\nsame period in 2023 due to decreased marketing spend focused on the business-to-consumer (“B2C\") travel market subsequent to the LBF divestiture.\nPersonnel Expenses\nPersonnel expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $9.7 million, or 79% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was\nprimarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of $6.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”) issued subsequent to the second quarter of 2023 and through the second quarter of 2024 not included in the prior year. The remaining increase was\ndue to additional employee headcount from the Company's 2023 acquisitions of Orinter, Consolid, Interep, Skypass, and the 2024 acquisition of Tailor Travel.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $1.2 million or 23% compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in the fair value remeasurement impact of earn-out consideration in the current period and a\ndecrease of $0.7 million in professional services due to the acquisitions of Interep and Orinter, which incurred external consulting costs during the three months\nended June 30, 2023.\nInformation Technology Expenses\nInformation technology expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024, decreased by $1.1 million, or 81% compared to the same period in 2023. The\ndecrease during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due an increase of $1.8 million in software costs capitalized during three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, which was partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million in artificial intelligence (“AI”) related platform development costs.\n40\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Credit Losses, Net\nProvision for credit losses, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.4 million or 1126%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to\nchanges in estimated recovery of accounts receivable during the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $0.2 million or 4% compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe decrease was primarily due to weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar in the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nRestructuring Expense, Net\nRestructuring expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.3 million, or 194%, compared to the same period in 2023. Restructuring\nexpense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was a net expense of $0.2 million due to one time severance payments. Restructuring expense for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 was a net benefit of $0.2 million due to gain recognized on the early termination of a lease offset by one-time severance payments.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was flat from no material change as compared to the same period in 2023.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $4.4 million or 52% compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was\nprimarily due to market increases in the SOFR benchmark and additional debt amendment fees of approximately $2.0 million incurred on our Term Loan\nsubsequent to 2023, which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the loan. The remaining increase is due to interest incurred of $1.0\nmillion for upfront collection of other receivables by Orinter and Interep during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\nChanges in fair value of warrant liability for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $0.4 million. The change was primarily due to a nominal\nincrease in fair value of the Company’s private warrants driven by the market price of the Company's common stock during the three months ended June 30,\n2024 as compared to a decrease in fair value of the Company’s private warrants driven by the market price of the Company's common stock during the same\nperiod in 2023.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $3.6 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to losses on\nforeign currency exchange generated in our foreign operations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nLoss before income taxes $ (25,516) $ (12,600)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (4) 2,008\nEffective income tax rate 0.02 % (15.94)%\nThe effective tax rate increased for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\nSix Months ended June 30, 2024 Compared to June 30, 2023\nRevenues, net for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased by $9.6 million or 9% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily\ndriven by the expanded market and business associated with the acquisitions of Orinter, Interep, Consolid, and Skypass, during 2023 on our integrated\ntechnology platform. This was partially offset from revenue lost of approximately $20.3 million from the sale of LBF. Because we merged customers and\nsupplier relationships from the business acquisitions into consolidated operations, separating revenues specifically from these acquired entities becomes\nimpractical.\nThe revenues, net increase is primarily contributed by our Travel Marketplace segment. Revenues from our Travel Marketplace segment for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 increased by $9.6 million or 9% compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an growth of commission revenues earned from\nmark-up fees on airline ticket sales, travel packages, hotel accommodations, and other travel products and travel services.\nThe revenue growth in our Travel Marketplace segment in 2024 was primarily impacted by a 3% increase, respectively in the value of gross bookings and\n59% increase in the number of transactions processed in our Travel Marketplace, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 , as compared to the\nsame period in 2023. Refer to our Factors Affecting Our Performance – Operating Metrics for further details.\nOperating Expenses and Other (Income) Expense\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.9 million or 1% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase\nwas primarily driven by an increase of $8.4 million, or 12%, in affiliate marketing expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023 due to additional sales and marketing activities, along with our expanded presence as a result of acquisitions of Orinter, Interep, Consolid and\nSkypass in 2023. This increase in affiliate marketing expense was offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of $5.3 million due to decreased advertising\nspend subsequent to the LBF divestiture, a decrease in chargebacks of $1.3 million, and a decrease in marketing expenses of $0.7 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nPersonnel Expenses\nPersonnel expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $15.5 million, or 78% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was\nprimarily attributable to increase in stock-based compensation of $9.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to restricted stock units (“RSUs”)\nissued subsequent to the second quarter of 2023 as well as additional employee headcount from the acquisitions of Orinter, Interep, Consolid, Skypass, and\nTailor Travel during 2023, which contributed to $5.0 million in payroll expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n42\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.1 million or 1% compared to the same period in 2023. The\nincrease was primarily due to $0.6 million increase in fair value remeasurement impact of earn-out consideration in the current period, and an increase of $0.5\nmillion in rent expense, which was partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in professional service expenses due to the acquisitions of Interep and Orinter,\nwhich incurred third-party consulting costs during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nInformation Technology Expenses\nInformation Technology expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased by $38 thousand or 2% compared to the same period in 2023. The\nincrease during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $0.8 million in AI related platform development costs, an increase of\n$0.6 million in web hosting costs, and an increase of $0.3 million in off shore IT costs, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.8 million of software\ncosts capitalized during six months ended June 30, 2024.\nProvision for Credit Losses, Net\nProvision for credit losses, net for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $0.6 million, or 92%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to\nchanges in estimated recovery of accounts receivable during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $2.0 million or 28% compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe increase was primarily due to an increase in amortization from additional capitalized software and an increase in amortization of intangibles as a result of\nthe acquisitions of Orinter, Interep, Consolid, Skypass and Purplegrids subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.\nRestructuring Expense, Net\nRestructuring expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $1.5 million, or 110% compared to the same period in 2023.

We use the terms “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Loss” and “Adjusted Net Loss Per Share” to evaluate our ongoing operations\nand for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S.\nGAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of\nour business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share to be important non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, because they illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe\nthat the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share are helpful to our investors in assessing the health of our business and\nour operating performance.\nIn addition, we believe the following non-GAAP measure, “Free Cash Flow”, is helpful in evaluating our liquidity. We use Free Cash Flow to measure\ncash generated internally that is available to service debt and fund inorganic growth or acquisitions and believe that this measure provides meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding our liquidity. We consider Free Cash Flow to be an important non-GAAP financial measure because it illustrates\nunderlying trends in our business and is helpful to our investors in assessing our liquidity.\nNon-GAAP financial information, which is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies\nin our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could\nreduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for the non-GAAP financial measures\nto the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial\nmeasures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any\nsingle financial measure to evaluate our business.\nFinancial measures that are non-GAAP should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other\nperformance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, or cash flows as measures of liquidity. These measures\nhave limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance, which provides useful information to\ninvestors, analysts and rating agencies. By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past\nand future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\nBecause Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for\nbusiness planning purposes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1)\n44\nTable of Contents\ndepreciation and amortization; (2) benefit (provision) for income taxes; (3) interest expense, net; (4) other income (expense), net; (5) stock-based compensation\nand the related payroll tax expense; (6) restructuring and related costs; (7) acquisition-related costs (including bank fees, due diligence fees, etc.); (8) legal\ncosts pertaining to acquisitions, and other filings which are not ordinary and outside the course of our business; (9) changes in fair value attributable to earn-out\nand warrant liabilities; and (10) and certain other expenses that could include expenses that are non-recurring.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these\nitems is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations, and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe\nAdjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful\nmeasure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance.\nSome of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA are as follows: (1) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future;\nand (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these\ncapital expenditures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, our investors should be aware that in the future we may not incur expenses similar to the adjustments in\nthis presentation.

By reporting Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share, we provide a basis\nfor comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core\noperating performance.\nWe define Adjusted Net Loss as net loss before (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) amortization of intangibles; (3) provision for income taxes; and\n(4) certain other operating expenses.\nThe following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted Net Loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet loss $ (25,512) $ (14,608) $ (10,904) 74.6 % $ (44,970) $ (27,523) $ (17,447) 63.4 %\nStock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense 11,991 4,804 7,187 149.6 % 17,298 7,451 9,847 132.2 %\nAmortization of intangibles 2,742 2,329 413 17.7 % 5,851 4,290 1,561 36.4 %\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (4) 2,008 (2,012) (100.2)% 641 2,707 (2,066) (76.3)%\nCertain other expenses1 753 1,204 (451) (37.5)% 3,324 4,082 (758) (18.6)%\nAdjusted net loss $ (10,030) $ (4,263) $ (5,767) 135.3 % $ (17,856) $ (8,993) $ (8,863) 98.6 %\n46\nTable of Contents\n1 Includes changes in fair value of earn-out liabilities, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, restructuring expense, acquisition and integration related costs,\nfinancing and refinancing related costs, and certain other expenses.\nWe define Adjusted Net Loss Per Share as the per share earnings based on the Company’s Adjusted Net Loss attributable to common stockholders, which\nincludes dividends accrued for preferred stockholders, in the respective periods presented. The following table reconciles net loss per share to Adjusted Net\nLoss per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nAdjusted Net Loss Per Share\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands, except share and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (25,512) $ (14,608) $ (44,970) $ (27,523)\nCumulative dividends allocated to preferred stockholders (3,937) (2,686) (7,742) (5,164)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (29,449) $ (17,294) $ (52,712) $ (32,687)\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 80,722,160 77,197,805 79,595,320 76,774,455\nBasic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.36) $ (0.22) $ (0.66) $ (0.43)\nAdjusted net loss $ (10,030) $ (4,263) $ (17,856) $ (8,993)\nCumulative dividends allocated to preferred stockholders (3,937) (2,686) (7,742) (5,164)\nAdjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders, basic and\n$ (13,967) $ (6,949) $ (25,598) $ (14,157)\ndiluted\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 80,722,160 77,197,805 79,595,320 76,774,455\nAdjusted net loss per share $ (0.17) $ (0.09) $ (0.32) $ (0.18)\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is a key measure that is relevant to investors because it provides a measure of cash generated internally that is available both to service\ndebt and to fund inorganic growth or acquisitions and provides useful information to investors regarding our liquidity. By reporting Free Cash Flow, we provide\na basis for comparison of our cash generated internally between current, past and future periods. Free Cash Flow has the same limitations as Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share in that it does not consider the capital structure of our Company. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP\nliquidity measure, is defined as cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures.\nWe believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it measures cash generated from operations after payment of\ncapital expenditures that we can use to invest in our business and meet our current and future financing needs.\nThe following table reconciles net cash used in operating activities to Free Cash Flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively (in thousands):\n47\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet cash\nprovided by\n(used in)\noperating\nactivities (1)(2) $ (7,599) $ (2,427) $ (5,172) 213.1 % $ 11,062 $ (12,406) $ 23,468 (189.2)%\nCapital\nexpenditures (2,904) (2,506) (398) 15.9 % (7,785) (4,474) (3,311) 74.0 %\nFree cash flow(1)\n(2) $ (10,503) $ (4,933) $ (5,570) 112.9 % $ 3,277 $ (16,880) $ 20,157 (119.4)%\n(1)\nIncluded cash paid for interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 of $2.9 million and $5.5 million and $0.5 million and\n$5.5 million, respectively.\n(2)\nIncluded cash paid for LBF US divestiture and transition service expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 of $0.7 million and $0.7\nmillion, respectively. No cash was paid for LBF US transition services for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of June 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were $32.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, which\nwere held for working capital purposes, as well as our revolving credit facility (“TCW LOC”) available for draw down of $15.0 million. To date, our principal\nsources of liquidity have been payments received from our revenue arrangements and financing arrangements with banks and financial institutions.\nAs of June 30, 2024, $19.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries\noutside of the United States. In the event that we repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries, we may need to accrue and pay applicable United States\ntaxes and withholding taxes payable to various countries. As of June 30, 2024, our intent was to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States,\nunless such funds can be repatriated without material tax consequences.\nAccordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes, U.S. state income taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of\napproximately $23.8 million of undistributed earnings from these foreign subsidiaries as those earnings and any excess of financial reporting over the tax basis\nof these foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate income tax liabilities that might be incurred if such earnings were\nremitted to the United States due to the complexity of the underlying calculation. The majority of the undistributed earnings would have been previously-taxed\nfor U.S. federal income taxes as a result of the 2017 U.S. Tax and Jobs Act. Although we have no intention to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our\nforeign subsidiaries for the foreseeable future, if such funds are needed for operations in the United States, to the extent applicable and material, we will revise\nfuture filings to address the potential tax implications.\nAlthough we have incurred both net loss and accumulated deficit and net cash outflow from operations from inception to date, in our opinion, our liquidity\nposition provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future\nborrowings, including refinancing activities, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.\nIn addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC not yet effective. Specific information on the terms of and the securities being\noffered will be provided at the time of the applicable offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for corporate purposes or other\npurposes to be disclosed at the time of offering.\nFinancial Position\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $23.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $9.0 million of restricted cash and short-term investments, and $15.0\nmillion in the unused TCW LOC. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Twenty-first\n48\nTable of Contents\nAmendment on the Term Loan was executed on August 13, 2024 and provided for an extension of the maturity date for the Term Loan and TCW LOC to\nAugust 31, 2025, provided that the maturity date will be automatically extended to June 30, 2028 if the Company executes a letter of credit facility in the\naggregate face amount of $15.0 million within 60 days of the Twenty-first Amendment going effective. As a result of the Twenty-first Amendment, the\nCompany is no longer required to make refinancing fees payable on the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan.\nThe amended Term Loan provides for principal and interest payments on the Term Loan of $19.3 million due within 12 months from the date of issuance\nof the consolidated financial statements. The Company may incur additional fees on the Term Loan depending on the timing of the consummation of the L/C\nFacility, which will result in changes to the principal and interest payments on the Term Loan in the 12 months from the date of issuance of the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nAs of the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that the cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities,\nand access to funds under our TCW LOC will satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the subsequent 12 months.\nTerm Loan Amendments\nOn January 17, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 12 (the “Twelfth Amendment”) to that certain financing agreement with TCW, dated as of\nDecember 23, 2019 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Term Loan”. The Twelfth\nAmendment (1) provided consent to the Company’s acquisition of Purple Grids Inc (“Purplegrids”); (2) required that the Company pledge 100% of the equity\ninterests of Purplegrids; (3) defers a portion of the principal and interest payments due in December 2023 to the termination of the Term Loan; (4) defers\ncertain refinancing milestones and modifies certain liquidity requirements; (5) modifies the payment of certain administrative fees to quarterly rather than\nannually; and (6) provides for the payment of certain fees.\nOn March 11, 2024, we executed a thirteenth amendment to the Term Loan (the “Thirteenth Amendment”). The Thirteenth Amendment (1) provided an\nextension of the maturity on the Term Loan to March 31, 2025 while the Company works to finalize a long-term facility; (2) no event of default for any\nrefinancing milestone; (3) extends the date on which a refinancing fee is potentially payable to April 30, 2024; (4) defers a portion of the principal amortization\ndue in March 2024 to the earlier of the date of the refinancing of the credit facility or June 30, 2024, and capitalizes a part of interest due in March 2024; (5)\nwaives any events of default that may have occurred prior to the Amendment; and (6) provides for a fee of $0.4 million “paid in kind” and added to the\noutstanding principal of the Term Loan.\nOn May 7, 2024, we executed the fourteenth amendment to the Term Loan (the “Fourteenth Amendment”). The Fourteenth Amendment provided an\nextension of the maturity on the Term Loan to June 30, 2025 while the Company works to finalize a long-term facility and specifies the timing of payments of\nrefinancing fees associated with various lenders on the Term Loan.\nDuring June 2024, we executed the fifteenth and sixteenth amendments to the Term Loan (collectively, the “Fifteenth and Sixteenth Amendments”). The\nFifteenth and Sixteenth Amendments provided an extension to the timing of payments for refinancing fees, principal, and interest on the Term Loan, while we\nwork to finalize a long-term facility with various lenders of the Term Loan.\nDuring July and August 2024, we executed the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth amendments to the Term Loan (collectively, the\n“Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Amendments”). The Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Amendments provided an\nextension to the timing of payments for refinancing fees, principal, and interest as well as the Maturity Date was extended to August 31, 2025 on the Term\nLoan, while we work to finalize a long-term facility with various lenders of the Term Loan.\nOn August 13, 2024, we executed the twenty-first amendment (“Twenty-first Amendment”) to the Term Loan. The amendment provided for the following\nterms: (i) extension of the Term Loan and TCW LOC maturity date to August 31, 2025 and provide that the maturity date will be automatically extended to\nJune 30, 2028 if we execute a letter of credit facility in the aggregate face amount of $15.0 million (“L/C Facility”); (ii) additional term loans with net proceeds\nof $5.0 million contingent on the closing of the L/C Facility; (iii) specifies the timing of payments of principal and interest on the Term Loan, waives a portion\nof the July 31, 2024 refinancing fees, and removes the requirement to pay refinancing fees on the outstanding Term Loan balance after July 31, 2024; (iv)\nspecifies additional amendment fees associated with the\n49\nTable of Contents\nTerm Loan; (v) amends certain financial covenants of the Term Loan; and (vi) waives the breach of the liquidity financial covenant to the Term Loan as of June\n30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we were in breach of the liquidity financial covenant on the Term Loan. In August 2024, we executed the Twenty-first Amendment on\nthe Term Loan that waived the breach of the liquidity financial covenant as of June 30, 2024. Our compliance with financial covenants is measured on a\nquarterly basis on the last calendar day of each quarter. If we were to fail a financial covenant, we would seek a waiver from our lenders. If we were unable to\nobtain a waiver and the default remained uncured after any applicable grace period, we would be in breach of the Term Loan, and the lenders would be entitled\nto declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable. In the event the borrowings are repaid prior to the maturity date after December 31, 2025,\nthere will be a prepayment penalty of 2% on the outstanding Term Loan principal balance.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 11,062 $ (12,406)\nNet cash used in investing activities (7,924) (26,624)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,296) 8,650\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (1,523) 528\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (3,681) $ (29,852)\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash\nflows during this period were our net loss totaling $45.0 million, which was offset by non-cash charges of $36.7 million primarily consisting of depreciation\nand amortization of $9.2 million, stock-based compensation of $16.8 million, amortization of loan origination fees of $4.2 million, paid in kind (“PIK”) interest\nexpense of $6.5 million. Cash provided by our operating assets and liabilities was $19.7 million, primarily due to a $12.2 million decrease in accounts\nreceivable, a $13.3 million increase in accounts payable, and a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, which was partially offset by a\n$4.9 million increase in contract assets, a $0.4 million increase in other non-current assets, and a $1.8 million decrease in deferred revenue.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $12.4 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows\nduring this period were our net loss of $27.5 million, which was offset by non-cash charges of $21.4 million primarily consisting of stock-based compensation\nof $7.4 million, PIK interest expense of $2.8 million and depreciation and amortization of $7.2 million. Cash provided from changes in our operating assets and\nliabilities was $6.3 million, primarily owing to a $20.5 million increase in accounts receivable, a $8.8 million increase in contract assets, a $0.4 million increase\nin other non-current assets, and a $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities. These changes were offset by a $24.7 million increase in\naccounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable was primarily due to the acquisitions of Orinter, Interep, and Consolid.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was $7.9 million, which was primarily due to the purchase of property,\nequipment and software.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $26.6 million, which was primarily due to cash paid or the acquisitions of\nOrinter, Interep, and Consolid and the purchase of property and equipment.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $5.3 million due to $2.5 million payment of earn out consideration,\n$1.9 million repayment of debt, and $0.8 million of payments to tax on vested restricted stock units.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $8.7 million primarily due to $15.0 million in proceeds funded by\nWingspire Capital LLC in addition to the already outstanding term loan (the “Wingspire Term Loan”), offset by the repayment of debt and offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes, other than the extension of the maturity date on the Term Loan, in our material\ncash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations–Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our critical accounting policies as disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Part I, Item 1, Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report for recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have operations in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Our market risk exposure is\nprimarily the effect of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDebt\nOur debt obligations consist of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to the TCW and Wingspire Team\nLoans (“TCW financing arrangement”). The interest rate on the TCW financing arrangement is tied to short-term interest rate benchmarks including the\nAdjusted Term SOFR. As of June 30, 2024, the interest rate for the outstanding loan is SOFR + 8.5%. The SOFR is closely related to the Fed Funds rate and a\nchange in interest rate could potentially change the loan interest rate.\nForeign Currency Risk\nPrior to fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, nearly all of our sales and expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars. Beginning in 2023, a more substantial\nportion of our revenues and operating expenses were incurred outside the United States, denominated in foreign currencies, and subject to fluctuations due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Brazilian real. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is that\ncountry’s local currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded to other income (expense), net.\nIn the event of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real, the impact for the six months ended June 30, 2024 would have\nbeen an increase of $5.1 million to our revenues, net and an increase of $0.4 million to our net profit (loss). Furthermore, many of our travel customers travel\ninternationally and any changes in the exchange rate between their home currency and the currency of their intended destination may influence their travel\npurchases. Our Brazilian operating entities occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts, in order to minimize the risks of foreign currency\nfluctuations. These contracts are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value. As of\n51\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2024, the asset related to these transactions amount was not material and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a total of\n$1.0 million gains on other income (expense), net.\n52\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded\nthat, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting\npreviously identified in Part II, Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023\nForm 10-K”).\nManagement's Remediation Efforts\nOur remediation efforts previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 to address\nthe material weaknesses mentioned are ongoing as we continue to implement and document policies, procedures, and internal controls. While we believe the\nsteps taken to date and those planned for future implementation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we have not\ncompleted all remediation efforts. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of\ntime and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n53\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

(Nasdaq: MOND) (“**Mondee** ” or the “**Company** ”), a leading travel marketplace and artificial intelligence (AI) technology company, announced today that the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) issuing a Staff determination (the “Staff Determination”) on November 27, 2024 after the Company informed the Staff that it would not contest a delisting of its Common Stock.\n\nThe Staff Determination noted that based on Staff’s review and the Form 8-K filed on November 26, 2024 (the “Form 8-K”), they have determined to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Form 8-K stated that, “On November 25, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) determined that the Company does not plan to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ rules and does not plan to appeal NASDAQ’s subsequent delisting of its Common Stock from NASDAQ.” The Company’s referenced Form 8-K was in response to Nasdaq’s original notice that the Company did not comply with Nasdaq’s filing requirements for continued inclusion set forth in Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it had not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAccordingly, the Company’s securities will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Trading of the Company’s common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on December 6, 2024 and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nThis announcement is made in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a notification of deficiency.\n\nThe delisting does not impact the Company’s business operations. The Company continues to support its customers, partners, and suppliers.\n\n**About Mondee Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries**\n\nEstablished in 2011, Mondee is a leading travel marketplace and artificial intelligence (AI) technology company with its headquarters based in Austin, Texas.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the Company’s future growth, performance, business prospects and opportunities, strategies, expectations, future plans and intentions or other future events. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\n\nManagement believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, the Company cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, the ability to implement business plans and forecasts, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company or others and any definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably, retain management and key employees, and maintain relationships with our distribution network and suppliers, the ability of the Company to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing standards, the expected changes to the Company’s capital structure, and other risks and uncertainties set forth in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and in the Company’s subsequent filings with the SEC. There may be additional risks that the Company does not presently know of or that the Company currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.\n\nNothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
