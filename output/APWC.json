          "content": "Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation Limited Announces Full\nYear 2023 Financial Results and Filing of Annual Report on Form\n20-F for 2023\nTAIPEI, Taiwan, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation\nLimited (NASDAQ: APWC) (\"APWC\" or the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer of wire and\ncable products for the telecommunications and electric-power industries in the Asia-Pacific\nregion, today announced that on April 29, 2024, it filed its annual report on Form 20-F (the\n\"Form 20-F\") for the year ended December 31, 2023 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and reported its financial results for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023. Unless otherwise indicated, all data are reported in U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing on the date of the event or result reported.\nFull Year 2023 Financial Results (Ended December 31, 2023) and 2022 comparative results:\nFull Year 2023 Full Year 2022 CHANGE\nRevenues $ 425.8 million $ 433.9 million (1.9)%\nOperating Profit $ 1.5 million $ 8.1 million (80.8)%\nNet Income $ 3.9 million $ 3.9 million (0.2)%\nEPS (1) $0.19 $0.19 —%\n(1) The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 20,616,227 and 20,020,364 basic and diluted weighted\naverage common shares issued and outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nFull Year 2023 Results\nRevenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were $425.8 million, a decrease\nof 1.9% from $433.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\nwas primarily attributable to revenue decreases across the Company’s Thailand and North\nAsia regions. Net revenue in the Company’s Thailand region decreased by $4.9 million or\n2.9% from $171.8 million in 2022 to $166.9 million in 2023. The decrease was due to the\n1\ndecrease in government spending on infrastructure and delay in government projects.\nRevenues in the Company's North Asia region decreased by $18.7 million, or 24.2%, from\n$77.3 million in 2022 to $58.6 million in 2023. The decrease was attributable to decreased\nsales volume primarily due to increased competition and the Sino-American trade war.\nThese factors contributed to a sluggish market, resulting in a decline in sales compared with\nthe previous period. Revenues in the Company's Rest of World (“ROW”) region increased by\n$15.5 million, or 8.4%, from $184.7 million in 2022 to $200.2 million in 2023. The increase of\n$1.9 million, or 12%, was due to strong demand in the construction sector in Australia, and\nthe increase of $13.6 million, or 88%, was attributable to the completion of public sector\nprojects in Singapore. The Company's North Asia region includes China, Hong Kong and\nTaiwan; the Thailand region consists of operations and sales within Thailand; the ROW\nregion includes Singapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has operations or\nsales outside of the Thailand region and North Asia region.\nOperating profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $1.5 million, a\ndecrease of $6.5 million, or 80.8% from operating profit of $8.1 million for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2022. Operating profit margin decreased from a profit of\n1.86% in 2022 to a profit of 0.36% in 2023. In the Thailand region, the operating profit\nmargin decreased from 1.53% in 2022 to (1.27)% in 2023. The decrease in operating profit\nwas due to a decline in higher-margin Thai government projects, decreased sales volume in\nenameled wire as well as loss from onerous contracts. In the North Asia region, the\noperating profit margin increased from 0.31% in 2022 to 3.06% in 2023. The increase in\noperating profit was the result of the increase in the manufacturing productivity, or overall\nequipment effectiveness (\"OEE\"), which lowered the cost of our products. The ROW region’s\noperating profit margin increased from 4.21% in 2022 to 4.31% in 2023. The operating profit\nmargin of 2023 remained consistent compared to that of 2022. The decrease in the\noperating profit is also attributable to the impairment loss on financial and contract assets,\nwhich increased by $4.1 million, due to the increased loss allowance provided for the\ndelinquent accounts.\n2\nSelling, general and administrative, research and development expenses for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 were $24.5 million, compared to $25.0 million reported\nfor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Net profit attributable to APWC\nshareholders was $3.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto a net profit of $3.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The\nweighted average number of shares issued and outstanding was 20.62 million and 20.02\nmillion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nAPWC reported $38.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023,\ncompared to cash and cash equivalents of $54.0 million as of December 31, 2022.\nCurrent assets totaled $295.0 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $299.5 million\nas of December 31, 2022. Working capital was $154.4 million as of December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $165.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Short-term bank loans were $53.7\nmillion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 17.9% from $45.6 million at December 31,\n2022. The Company had $— million in long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $12.2 million in long-term debt as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was\ndue to the reclassification of the long-term back loan as a current portion. Shareholder's\nequity attributable to APWC was $157.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to\n$151.6 million as of December 31, 2022.\nAPWC reported cash used in operating activities of $6.1 million during the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023, compared to cash provided by operating activities in the amount\nof $6.6 million in the same period in 2022. The cash outflow from operating activities was\nprimarily due to several factors, including decreased net profit, and increased trade\nreceivables. The Company reported $4.9 million in cash outflows from investing activities\nduring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.7 million in cash\n3\noutflows in the same period of 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities in the\ntwelve months of 2023 was primarily attributable to the increase in purchases of property,\nplant in 2023. APWC reported $5.5 million in cash outflows from financing activities during\nthe twelve months of 2023, compared to $9.6 million in cash inflows from financing\nactivities in the same period of 2022. The cash used in 2023 was primarily attributable to the\nrepayment of borrowings.\nWe encourage shareholders to review our Annual Report for the year ended December 31,\n2023, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to visit the\nCompany's website for further information (www.apwcc.com).

The operating profit fell following a decline in higher-\nmargin Thai government projects and the fluctuation of copper prices. In the North Asia\nregion, the operating profit margin increased from 0.69% in 2022 to 3.21% in 2023, resulting\nfrom the reversal of the provision for employee benefits and pensions expenses.

Unless otherwise indicated, all data are reported in U.S. Dollars at\nthe exchange rate prevailing on the date of the event or result reported.\nFirst Nine Months 2024 Financial Results (Ended September 30, 2024), and 2023\ncomparative results\nFirst 9 Months 2024 First 9 Months 2023 CHANGE\nRevenues $ 336.6 million $ 294.2 million 14.4%\nOperating Profit $ 4.5 million $ 0.1 million 3970.0%\nNet Income $ 0.9 million $ 1.1 million (19.5)%\nEPS1 $ 0.04 $ 0.05 (20.0)%\nRevenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $336.6 million, an increase\nof 14.4% from $294.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase\nwas attributable to revenue increases across the Company’s Thailand, North Asia and Rest of\nWorld (\"ROW\") regions. Net revenue in the Company’s Thailand region increased by 14.7%,\nmainly driven by higher sales of power cables and fabrication services. However, in Q3 2024,\nthe wire and cable market in Thailand experienced a shift in momentum. While earlier\nquarters, particularly Q1, saw significant growth fueled by government projects and\ncontracts with state-owned enterprises, the pace of activity slowed in Q3. Less favorable\neconomic conditions reportedly led to a deceleration in customer projects. As a result,\nshipment volumes stopped rising as rapidly and instead remained steady or slightly declined,\nespecially for products like low-voltage and medium-to-high-voltage cables, which had\npreviously experienced strong demand. Revenues in the Company's North Asia region\n1 The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 20,616,227 and 20,616,227 basic and diluted weighted\naverage common shares issued and outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The numerator uses the profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent.\n1\nincreased by 17.8% for several reasons, including a rise in copper prices, an increase in the\nnumber of new customers, and the commencement of rectangular wire production as well\nas wires for drone motors. Revenues in the Company's ROW region increased by 13.1%: the\nprimary driver of this growth was the amplified sales of power cables, spurred by the\nincreased demand in 2024 in Singapore. The Company's North Asia region includes China,\nHong Kong and Taiwan; the Thailand region consists of operations and sales within Thailand;\nthe ROW region includes Singapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has\noperations or sales outside of the Thailand region and North Asia region.\nOperating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.5 million, an\nincrease of 3970.0% from operating profit of $0.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Operating profit margin increased from a loss of 0.04% in 2023 to a\nprofit of 1.33% in 2024. In the Thailand region, the operating profit margin increased from\n(3.78)% in 2023 to 2.85% in 2024. This positive shift was largely due to enhanced\nprofitability in the public sector. In the North Asia region, the operating profit margin\ndecreased from 3.21% in 2023 to (1.62)% in 2024: this downturn was primarily due to the\nreversal of previously provided provisions for employee benefits and pensions in 2023, along\nwith a rise in research and development expenditures in 2024. The ROW region’s operating\nprofit margin decreased from 3.21% in 2023 to 1.74% in 2024 primarily due to an increased\nallowance for onerous contracts in Singapore.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwere $19.0 million, compared to $17.9 million reported for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Net profit attributable to APWC equity shareholders of the parent was\n$0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net profit of\n$1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average number\nof shares issued and outstanding was 20.62 million and 20.62 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nAPWC reported $34.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to cash and cash equivalents of $38.5 million as of September 30, 2023.\n2\nCurrent assets totaled $287.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $295.0 million\nas of December 31, 2023. Working capital was $171.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\nShort-term bank loans were $44.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8.8 million\nfrom $53.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Company had $6.1 million in long-term debt\noutstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to no long-term debt outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Shareholder's equity attributable to APWC was $163.7 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $157.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nAPWC reported cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in operating activities in the amount of\n$14.0 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The cash inflow from operating activities\nwas primarily attributable to the increase in sales. The Company reported $2.2 million in\ncash outflows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $3.6 million in cash outflows in the same period of 2023. The decrease in cash\nused in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily\nattributable to the increase in disposal of property, plant and equipment in 2024. APWC\nreported $5.4 million in cash outflows from financing activities during the first nine months\nof 2024, compared to $5.1 million in cash inflows from financing activities in the same\nperiod of 2023. The shift was primarily due to increased borrowings in 2023.\nWe encourage shareholders to visit the Company's website for further information\n(www.apwcc.com).

Unless otherwise indicated, all data are reported in U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing on the date of the event or result reported.\nFirst Six Months 2024 Financial Results (Ended June 30, 2024), and 2023 comparative\nresults\nFirst 6 Months 2024 First 6 Months 2023 CHANGE\nRevenues $ 214.3 million $ 193.5 million 10.8%\nOperating Profit $ 1.2 million $ -2.8 million 144.7%\nNet Income $ -0.5 million $ 0.02 million (3500.0)%\nEPS1 $ -0.02 $ 0.001 (2100.0)%\nRevenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $214.3 million, a increase of 10.8%\nfrom $193.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was attributable\nto revenue increases across the Company’s Thailand, North Asia and Rest of World (\"ROW\")\nregions. Net revenue in the Company’s Thailand region increased by 14.0%, mainly driven by\nhigher sales of power cables and fabrication services, fueled by economic expansion and\ngovernment efforts in infrastructure development, public utilities, and the implementation\nof renewable energy, particularly solar power. Revenues in the Company's North Asia region\nincreased by 12.5% for several reasons, including a rise in copper prices, growth in the\nnumber of new customers, and the commencement of rectangular wire production.\nAlthough the sales volume of rectangular wires was not large, their prices were relatively\nhigher. Revenues in the Company's ROW region increased by 7.5%, the primary driver of this\ngrowth was the amplified sales of power cables, spurred by the increased demand in 2024 in\n1 The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 20,616,227 and 20,616,227 basic and diluted weighted\naverage common shares issued and outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The numerator uses the profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent.\n1\nSingapore. The Company's North Asia region includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; the\nThailand region consists of operations and sales within Thailand; the ROW region includes\nSingapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has operations or sales outside of\nthe Thailand region and North Asia region.\nOperating profit for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.2 million, a increase of\n144.7% from operating profit of $-2.8 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2023. Operating profit margin increased from a loss of (1.44)% in 2023 to a profit of 0.58%\nin 2024. In the Thailand region, the operating profit margin increased from (7.87)% in 2023\nto 1.41% in 2024. This positive shift was largely due to enhanced profitability in the public\nsector and the reversal of the inventory valuation provision. In the North Asia region, the\noperating profit margin decreased from 7.08% in 2023 to (1.52)% in 2024, this downturn was\nprimarily due to the reversal of previously provided provisions for employee benefits and\npensions in 2023, along with a rise in research and development expenditures in 2024.\nThe ROW region’s operating profit margin decreased from 2.11% in 2023 to 1.66% in 2024\nprimarily due to an increased allowance for onerous contracts in Singapore.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were\n$12.5 million, compared to $11.0 million reported for the six months ended June 30,\n2023. Net profit attributable to APWC equity shareholders of the parent was $-0.5 million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net profit of $0.02 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The weighted average number of shares issued and\noutstanding was 20.62 million and 20.62 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nAPWC reported $33.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024, compared to\ncash and cash equivalents of $39.0 million as of June 30, 2023.\nCurrent assets totaled $282.5 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $295.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.

The decrease in cash\nused in investing activities in the six months of 2024 was primarily attributable to the\ndecrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2024. APWC reported $9.1\nmillion in cash inflows from financing activities during the first six months of 2024, compared\nto $7.4 million in cash outflows from financing activities in the same period of 2023.
