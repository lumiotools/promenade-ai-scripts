(\"36Kr\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: KRKR), a prominent brand and pioneering platform dedicated to serving New Economy participants in China, recently announced the launch of 36Kr European Central Station ([_https://eu.36kr.com/_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kGoCYPnU5cEOhK1EWNQb83i3GOiKtHyUF5zFw1Dd__R3sjBBRCYVJRDhOVsumm3EXuVJk9GHmqnn37HsHGVXpw==)). The Company has initiated the recruitment of business partners for collaboration in Europe, actively advancing its global expansion. Currently, 36Kr Europe mainly features news coverage on startups from the 36Kr ecosystem, along with original content such as “A Kr-uarter Past Eight,” equipping overseas stakeholders with timely and comprehensive information on Chinese business. This initiative enables 36Kr Europe users to access the same information at the same time as those in China, elevating the visibility and influence of Chinese companies across the European market.\n\nFor years, 36Kr has been dedicated to covering, serving, and empowering New Economy participants in China, continually connecting resources for corporate clients and ecosystem partners. The Company’s international footprint has been growing steadily, with a solid presence already established in Japan (36Kr Japan) and Southeast Asia (Kr Asia). Building on years of extensive efforts by its overseas teams, 36Kr has cultivated significant ties with foreign governments, major industry players, startups, and capital ecosystems, amassing a wealth of success stories and experiences in facilitating global business expansion. We have consistently delivered media services and marketing support to Chinese companies overseas, while our international teams help foreign institutions and enterprises tap into business opportunities in China. Moving forward, 36Kr will remain committed to expanding and integrating cooperative resources, fostering synergy within a wider global ecosystem to better serve businesses and governments in their international ventures while consistently boosting 36Kr’s worldwide impact and further driving revenue growth.\n\n36Kr European Central Station leverages AIGC technology to empower its content ecosystem, notably improving productivity while lowering content creation costs. It currently supports browsing in English, German, and Chinese, with plans to add more languages and country-specific channels. For instance, regarding image generation, AIGC’s text-to-image functionality can drastically reduce imaging costs by hundreds of times. For text translation, AIGC’s large language models and computing power will greatly enhance the efficiency of text translation, transcreation, and copywriting across diverse languages. Additionally, with respect to information and data collation, we have observed AIGC’s ability to effectively generate first drafts, minimizing both our labor costs and editing input.\n\nMr. Dagang Feng, Chief Executive Officer of 36Kr, commented, “As global expansion becomes an irreversible trend, we will continue to intensify our international efforts for greater penetration of overseas markets, harnessing AI applications to deliver more efficient and cost-effective information dissemination.

The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the average compensation level for our research and development personnel as we restructured our R&D team.\n\n\n\nShare-based compensation expenses recognized in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, as well as general and administrative expenses totaled RMB0.05 million (US$6.4 thousand) in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB3.7 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Other****expenses** were RMB24.3 million (US$3.3 million) in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB6.0 million of other income in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Income tax expenses** were RMB0.07 million (US$0.01 million) in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to RMB0.2 million of income tax credit in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net loss** was RMB95.9 million (US$13.2 million) in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net loss of RMB52.7 million in the same period of 2023. **Non-GAAP adjusted net loss 6 **was RMB95.9 million (US$13.2 million) in the first half of 2024, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of RMB49.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net loss attributable to 36Kr Holdings Inc.'s ordinary shareholders** was RMB94.4 million (US$13.0 million) in the first half of 2024, compared to net loss attributable to 36Kr Holdings Inc.'s ordinary shareholders of RMB52.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted net loss per ADS** were both RMB2.245 (US$0.309) in the first half of 2024, compared to basic and diluted net loss per ADS of RMB1.258 in the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Certain Balance Sheet Items_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB96.9 million (US$13.3 million).\n\n____________________\n\n6 Non-GAAP adjusted income/(loss) represents net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on September 3, 2024 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on September 3, 2024).\n\nFor participants who wish to join the call by phone, please access the link provided below to complete the pre-registration and dial in 5 minutes prior to the scheduled call start time.

The presentation of these two non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nAdjusted net loss represents net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents adjusted net income/(loss) before interest income, interest expenses, income tax expense/(credit), depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. \n\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to Renminbi are made at a rate of RMB7.2672 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on of June 28, 2024.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
