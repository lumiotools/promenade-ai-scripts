PDA is addicted to the activity of the mutated KRAS oncogene which is considered so far an undruggable therapeutic target. We propose an approach to target KRAS effectively in patients using RNA interference. To meet this challenge, we have developed a local prolonged siRNA delivery system (Local Drug EluteR, LODER) shedding siRNA against the mutated KRAS (KRAS-LODER).The KRAS-LODER was assessed for its structural, release, and delivery properties in vitro and in vivo.The effect of the KRAS-LODER on tumor growth was assessed in s.c. and orthotopic mouse models. KRAS silencing effect was further assessed on the KRAS downstream signaling pathway. The LODER-encapsulated siRNA was stable and active in vivo for 155 d. Treatment of PDA cells with KRAS-LODER resulted in a significant decrease in KRAS levels, leading to inhibition of proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In vivo, KRAS-LODER impeded the growth of human pancreatic tumor cells and prolonged mouse survival. We report a reproducible and safe delivery platform based on a miniature biodegradable polymeric matrix, for the controlled and prolonged delivery of siRNA. This technology provides the following advantages: (i) siRNA is protected from degradation; (ii) the siRNA is slowly released locally within the tumor for prolonged periods; and (iii) the KRAS-LODER elicits a therapeutic effect, thereby demonstrating that mutated KRAS is indeed a druggable target.\n\n[ Read more ](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1314307110)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mutant-KRAS-is-a-druggable-target-for-pancreatic-cancer.jpg)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/99Asset-7.svg)\n\n  * Email: info@silexion.com\n\n\n\n[ ![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/חתימה-אתר.png) ](https://web.irm.co.il/)\n"

Tumors are highly resistant to diffusion, and the lack of blood and lymphatic flows suppresses convection.Prolonged, continuous intratumoral drug delivery from a miniature drug source offers an alternative to both systemic delivery and intratumoral injection. Presented here is a model of drug distribution from such a source, in a multistep process. At delivery onset the drug mainly affects the closest surroundings. Such ‘priming’ enables drug penetration to successive cell layers. Tumor ‘void volume’ (volume not occupied by cells) increases, facilitating lymphatic perfusion. The drug is then transported by hydraulic convection downstream along interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) gradients, away from the tumor core. After a week tumor cell death occurs throughout the entire tumor and IFP gradients are flattened. Then, the drug is transported mainly by ‘mixing’, powered by physiological bulk body movements.Steady state is achieved and the drug covers the entire tumor over several months.Supporting measurements are provided from the LODER™ system, releasing siRNA against mutated KRAS over months in pancreatic cancer in-vivo models. LODER™ was also successfully employed in a recent Phase 1/2 clinical trial with pancreatic cancer patients.\n\n[ Read more ](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/5051/)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/silenseed_lab_worker.jpg)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/99Asset-7.svg)\n\n  * Email: info@silexion.com\n\n\n\n[ ![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/חתימה-אתר.png) ](https://web.irm.co.il/)\n"

RNA interference (RNAi)-based drugs present the potential for a new targeted treatment. LOcal Drug EluteR (LODERTM) is a novel biodegradable polymeric matrix that shields drugs against enzymatic degradation and releases small interfering RNA (siRNA) against G12D-mutated KRAS (siG12D). KRAS-LODER has successfully passed a phase 1/2a clinical trial. Such a formulation necessitates biocompatibility and safety studies. We describe the safety and toxicity studies with KRAS-LODER in 192 Hsd:Sprague Dawley rats, after repeated subcutaneous administrations (days 1, 14, and 28). Animals were sacrificed on days 29 and 42 (recovery phase). In all groups, no adverse effects were noted, and all animals showed favorable local and systemic tolerability. Histopathologically, LODER implantation resulted in the expected capsule formation, composed of a thin fibrotic tissue. On the interface between the cavity and the capsule, a single layer composed of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells was observed. No difference was noted between the placebo and KRAS-LODER groups. These findings provide valuable information for future preclinical studies with siRNA-bearing biodegradable polymers and for the safety aspects of RNAi-based drugs as a targeted therapy.\n\n[ Read more ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0192623316645860?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/siRNA-Drug-Used-as-a-Local-and-Prolonged-Delivery-System-for-Pancreatic-Cancer-Therapy.jpg)\n\n![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/99Asset-7.svg)\n\n  * Email: info@silexion.com\n\n\n\n[ ![](https://silexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/חתימה-אתר.png) ](https://web.irm.co.il/)\n\n# Ilan Hadar- Chairman\n\n55, has served as Managing Director of Silexion since April 2022 and as Chairman of the Board since May 2024.
