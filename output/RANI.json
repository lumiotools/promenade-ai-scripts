(“Rani Therapeutics” or “Rani”) (Nasdaq: RANI), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on the oral delivery of biologics and drugs, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We are pleased with the progress we have made this quarter headlined by new preclinical pharmacokinetic data supporting the transenteric delivery of a GLP-1 incretin triagonist. This data, combined with the previously announced pharmacodynamic data from the study, underscores the potential of the RaniPill® to contribute to the GLP-1 receptor agonist space and the broader obesity therapeutics market,” said Talat Imran, Chief Executive Officer of Rani. “Additionally, we raised $20 million in aggregate gross proceeds from financings in July and October, enabling us to extend our cash runway into the third quarter of 2025. Looking ahead, we are excited to start our Phase 1 trial of RT-114 containing a GLP-1/GLP-2 dual agonist for the treatment of obesity next year.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Subsequent Highlights:**\n\n  * **Announced new preclinical pharmacokinetic data supporting transenteric delivery of GLP-1 incretin triagonist.** In October 2024, Rani announced new pharmacokinetic data from a preclinical study evaluating a GLP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors incretin triagonist with a delivery method mimicking the RaniPill® route of administration. The pharmacokinetic data provides further evidence of the RaniPill® platform’s potential to enable oral delivery of multiple obesity treatments.\n  * **Completed two equity offerings for total gross proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.** In equity offerings in July and October 2024, Rani completed the sale and issuance of Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase Class A common stock, and warrants to purchase Class A common stock, to an institutional investor for total gross proceeds of approximately $20.0 million, excluding any potential proceeds from the exercise of warrants, if any.\n\n\n\n**Near-Term Milestone Expectations:**\n\n  * Initiation of Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-114 containing a GLP-1/GLP-2 dual agonist for the treatment of obesity expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities** as of September 30, 2024 totaled $30.4 million, compared to $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Rani expects its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to be sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n  * **Research and development expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $6.2 million, compared to $11.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $5.0 million in research and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributed to lower compensation costs of $1.9 million due to reduction in workforce, $2.7 million reduction in third-party services and $0.4 million reduction in materials and supplies due to the timing of certain preclinical and clinical studies.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.6 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $1.0 million in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributed to lower compensation costs of $0.5 million due to reduction in workforce, $0.4 million reduction in third-party services due to lower directors and officers insurance premiums and $0.3 million reduction in other costs, offset by an increase in facility costs of $0.2 million due to the lease in Fremont, California.\n  * **Net loss** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $12.7 million, compared to $18.3 million for the same period in 2023, including stock-based compensation expense of $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Rani Therapeutics** Rani Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on advancing technologies to enable the development of orally administered biologics and drugs. Rani has developed the RaniPill® capsule, which is a novel, proprietary and patented platform technology, intended to replace subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion of biologics and drugs with oral dosing.
