(the Company), which comprise the balance sheet\nas at 31 December 2023, and the income statement, the cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the\nfinancial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements comply with Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorpora-\ntion.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities\nunder those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial\nstatements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law\nand the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance\nwith these requirements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going con-\ncern. As discussed in Note 3 a) to these financial statements, the Company expects to continue to generate operating\nlosses and negative operating cash flows and its existing cash and cash equivalents and access to existing financing\narrangements will not be sufficient to fund operations, indicating the existence of material uncertainty and raising sub-\nstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these mat-\nters are also described in Note 3 a). The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty. If it is not possible for the Company to continue as a going concern, in particular if it’s liquid-\nity management and the option to raise funds are unsuccessful, the financial statements will need to be prepared on the\nbasis of liquidation values. This would lead to a substantiated concern that the company’s liabilities exceed its assets\nwithin the meaning of article 725b CO, requiring compliance with the corresponding legal provisions. Our opinion is not\nmodified in respect of this matter.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Birchstrasse 160, Postfach, 8050 Zürich, Switzerland\nTelefon: +41 58 792 44 00, www.pwc.ch\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG is a member of the global PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, each of which is a separate and independent legal entity.\nOur audit approach\nOverview Overall materiality: CHF 180'000\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable\nus to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into ac-\ncount the structure of the Company, the accounting processes and controls,\nand the industry in which the Company operates.\nAs key audit matter the following area of focus has been identified:\nRecoverability of intangible assets (patents and capitalized R&D)\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable\nassurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or\nerror. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall\nmateriality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative consider-\nations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to\nevaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\nOverall materiality CHF 180'000\nBenchmark applied Total assets\nWe chose total assets as the materiality benchmark because, in our view, it is\nRationale for the materiality bench-\nthe benchmark against which the performance of the company, which is a start-\nmark applied up still in a developmental phase and has no recurring revenues and some of\nthe expenses of R&D are capitalized, is most commonly measured.\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 9'000 identified during our\naudit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nAudit scope\nWe designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial state-\nments. In particular, we considered where subjective judgements were made; for example, in respect of significant ac-\ncounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in\nall of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters\nconsideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the fi-\nnancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial state-\nments as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In\naddition to the matter described in the 'Material uncertainty related to going concern' section, we have determined the\nmatter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.\n3 NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting\nRecoverability of intangible assets (patents and capitalized R&D)\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nThe balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 includes We performed in particular the following audit procedures:\nintangible assets after impairment of CHF 16.4 million which\nare comprised of capitalized research and development cost  We gained an understanding of the accounting\n(CHF 15.9 million) and patents (CHF 0.5 million).

The other information comprises the information included\nin the annual report, but does not include the financial statements, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports\nthereon.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assur-\nance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing\nso, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge ob-\ntained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we\nare required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n4 NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting\nBoard of Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the provisions of\nSwiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines\nis necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to con-\ntinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\nof accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no\nrealistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from ma-\nterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable\nassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and\nSA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic de-\ncisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and maintain profes-\nsional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, de-\nsign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropri-\nate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher\nthan for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or\nthe override of internal control.\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropri-\nate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's in-\nternal control.\n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and re-\nlated disclosures made.\n Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast\nsignificant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence ob-\ntained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease\nto continue as a going concern.\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned\nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that\nwe identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant\nethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them regarding all relationships and other matters\nthat may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats\nor safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that\nwere of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit\nmatters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the\nmatter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report\nbecause the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits\nof such communication.\n5 NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\nIn accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm the existence of an internal control sys-\ntem that has been designed, pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Directors, for the preparation of the financial\nstatements.\nWe further confirm that the proposed carry forward of the accumulated losses complies with Swiss law and the Com-\npany’s articles of incorporation.

For this Closing, the company issued the Common Shares out of its available treasury shares and\ncreate the remainder of the necessary Common Shares out of the Company's authorized share capital made available following the\nEGM in December '22. The non-par share price of CHF 0.85 for the pre-funded warrants was paid on December, 13, 2022 leaving the\npar value of CHF 0.02 due upon exercise of the warrant. As a result, the pre-funded warrants were shown as liability to the shareholders\non December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, an amount of 3,242,887 treasury shares were created and the respective liability was\nreversed.\nThe Company entered into a series of short-term loan agreements with certain existing shareholders of the Company, including Ronald\nHafner, the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Felix Grisard, Jürgen Bauer and Maria Nayvalt, providing for unsecured loans\nto the Company in the aggregate amount of CHF 1'375'000.

The purpose of the Option Plan is to\nretain, attract and motivate management, employees, directors and consultants by providing them with options to purchase our\ncommon shares. The Board allocated fifteen percent (15%) of our fully diluted shares to awards that may be made pursuant to the\nOption Plan.\nThe exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions of the awards to be granted under the Option Plan are determined by the board of\ndirectors, except that no stock option may be issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock at the\ndate of the grant or have a term in excess of ten years. Options granted under the Option Plan are exercisable in whole or in part at any\ntime subsequent to vesting.\nThe following table summarizes total stock option activity for the period ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted\nExcercise Average Grant\nNumber of Options Price date Fair Value\nUSD USD\nBalance at December 31, 2022 1 ’333’123 1.23\nGranted 776’344 0.76\nExcercised - -\nExpired/cancelled - 245’809 -\nBalance at December 31, 2023 1 ’863’658 1.07\nOptions vested and exercisable 449’515 0.24\nOptions expected to vest 1 ’414’143 0.39\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life of each of the options outstanding, options vested and exercisable and options\nexpected to vest at December 31, 2023 was 8.84 years.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair\nvalue of the Company’s common stock for those stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company’s\ncommon stock. The share price as of December 31, 2023 was $0.59. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and expected\nto vest each year, as well as the intrinsic value of exercisable options was $54'899.\ni) Legal capital reserve from capital contribution\nThe legal capital reserves from capital contribution amounts as of December 31, 2023 CHF 47'188'748. Thereof CHF 28'302'959 have\nbeen already approved by the Swiss Federal Tax Administation. The remaining balance of the legal capital reserves from capital\ncontribution has not been approved by Swiss Federal Tax Administartion.\nNLS Pharmaceutics AG, Kloten\nNotes to the financial statements as per December 31, 2023\n3. Other disclosures\na) Going Concern\nThe Company is in its start-up phase and subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the timing of achieving\nprofitability and the substantial uncertainty of the development process. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses\nand negative operating cash flows for the next few years and will need additional funding to support its planned operating activities\nthrough profitability. The Company’s ability to continue operations also depends on its ability to raise additional capital to fund\noperations and assure the solvency of the Company until revenues reach a level to sustain positive cash flows. These conditions indicate\nthe existence of material uncertainties, which may cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company reported CHF769'719 in of cash and cash equivalents which is less than the liquidity needs for the\nnext 12 months.\nAs part of its liquidity management, the Company is actively exploring a range of options to raise funds, including strategic partnerships,\nout-licensing, or divestment of assets of the Company, and other future strategic actions. The Company is engaged in discussions with\nthird party creditors to extend payment terms and has secured extensions on maturity dates on its existing bridge loans to December\n31, 2024 and June 30, 2025 respectively (see subsequent event note). The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to\nextend payment terms with third party creditors until additional funds have been raised.

(the Company) for the year ended 31 December\n2023. The audit was limited to the information pursuant to article 734a-734f CO in the tables marked 'audited' on pages\n3 and 4 of the compensation report.\nIn our opinion, the information pursuant to article 734a-734f CO in the accompanying compensation report complies with\nSwiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities\nunder those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the compen-\nsation report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law\nand the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance\nwith these requirements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOther information\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included\nin the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the compensation report, the financial state-\nments and our auditor’s reports thereon.\nOur opinion on the compensation report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assur-\nance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the compensation report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing\nso, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the compen-\nsation report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we\nare required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nBoard of Directors' responsibilities for the compensation report\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a compensation report in accordance with the provisions of\nSwiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines\nis necessary to enable the preparation of a compensation report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error. It is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation pack-\nages.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Birchstrasse 160, Postfach, 8050 Zürich, Switzerland\nTelefon: +41 58 792 44 00, www.pwc.ch\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG is a member of the global PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, each of which is a separate and independent legal entity.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the compensation report\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to article 734a-734f CO is\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with\nSwiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or\nerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of this compensation report.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and maintain profes-\nsional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the compensation report, whether due to fraud or error, de-\nsign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropri-\nate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher\nthan for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or\nthe override of internal control.\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropri-\nate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's in-\nternal control.\n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and re-\nlated disclosures made.\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned\nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that\nwe identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant\nethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safe-\nguards applied.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG\nBruno Rossi Samuel Häring\nLicensed audit expert Licensed audit expert\nAuditor in charge\nZürich, May 15, 2024\nEnclosure:\n Compensation report\n3 NLS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting\nThis Compensation Report has been prepared in compliance with Swiss laws and regulations.

The Company's lead product candidate, Quilience®, is a proprietary extended-release formulation of mazindol\n(mazindol ER) and is being developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, and potentially other sleep-wake disorders such as\nidiopathic hypersomnia. Mazindol is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor and partial orexin-2 receptor agonist, which\nwas used for many years to treat patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in compassionate use programs. A phase 2 study in\nthe U.S. evaluating Quilience® in adult subjects suffering from narcolepsy is currently being conducted. Previously, NLS\nsuccessfully completed a phase 2 study in the U.S. evaluating Nolazol ® (mazindol controlled release) in adult subjects\nsuffering from ADHD. The study met all primary and secondary endpoints and Nolazol ® was well-tolerated. Quilience®\nhas received Orphan Drug Designations both in the U.S. and in Europe for the treatment of narcolepsy. Up to 1/3 of\nnarcoleptic patients are also diagnosed with ADHD.\nNLS Pharmaceutics’ compensation policy is designed to attract, motivate, and retain talent in order to support the\nachievement of the Company’s financial and strategic objectives. The policy further aims at ensuring a fair and\ncompetitive compensation package. The Board believes that by combining short- and long-term incentive elements, the\ncompensation system helps to align the interests of the Board members and Executive Management with the interests of\nthe Company and its shareholders. In addition, compensation elements are focused on rewarding the delivery of\noutstanding and sustainable results without inappropriate risk-taking.\nMethod of Determining Compensation\nThe Role and Powers of the Compensation, Nomination and Governance Committee (CNC)\nThe CNC consists of two (2) members, who are appointed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the\ncommittee enacts its own charter.\nCompensation Guidelines:\nThe CNC recommends guidelines for the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors, the CEO, and the\nExecutive Management, and submits these recommendations to the Board of Directors for approval.\nThe CNC provides an overall package for near- and long-term compensation, including variable compensation, that (1) is\ndesigned to attract, motivate, and retain persons with the necessary skills and character, (2) is consistent with market\nconditions, and in the case of variable compensation, consistent with the Company’s and individual’s performance, and\n(3) aligns the interests of the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management with the interests of the\nCompany. The CNC also periodically reviews the Company’s compensation policies for its employees who are not\nmembers of the Executive Management and if appropriate, suggests changes to the Board.\nThe CNC meets at least four times per year and informs the Board of Directors of its recommendations and resolutions after\neach meeting.\nApproval of Compensation by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting\nSwiss law requires a binding approval of the maximum compensation for the Board and the Executive Management. Each\nyear, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting separately approves the total maximum amounts proposed by the Board of\nDirectors pursuant to Articles 23 and 24 of the Articles of Association for:\n(1) the non-performance-related compensation of the Board of Directors for the next term of office;\n(2) a possible additional compensation of the Board of Directors for the preceding business year;\n(3) the non-performance-related compensation of the Executive Management for the 12-month period\nstarting on 1 July following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting;\n(4) the variable compensation for the Executive Management for the current year; and\n(5) the grant of options in the Company to the Board of Directors and the Executive Management.\nThe respective total compensation amounts include social security and occupational pension contributions for the benefit of\nthe members of the Board of Directors, the Executive Management, and the Company.\n5\nIf the Annual Shareholders' Meeting refuses to approve a respective motion by the Board of Directors, the Board of\nDirectors may either submit a new motion at the same meeting or determine a maximum total remuneration or several\nmaximum partial remunerations, subject to the relevant principles of the compensation, or submit a new motion to the next\nAnnual Shareholders' Meeting for approval. The Company may pay remunerations within the framework of the maximum\ntotal or partial remuneration and subject to the approval by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\nCompensation of the Board of Directors\nThe CNC reviews and proposes to the Board of Directors the resolution to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders'\nMeeting for the maximum total compensation of the Board of Directors. The CNC will also request approval by the\nBoard of Directors of the individual compensation packages to be paid to members of the Board of Directors.\nThe compensation for members of the Board typically consists of:\n(1) Annual cash compensation\n(2) Annual grant of options\nBoth components do not depend on the achievement of corporate goals or the individual performance of a Board member.\nAdditionally, the Company pays the employer’s social security contributions due on these amounts. Board members do\nnot receive any variable compensation and do not participate in the Company’s pension plan.\nCompensation of the Executive Management\nThe CNC evaluates annually the performance of the CEO and the Executive Management and submits such evaluation\nfor review and approval by the Board of Directors, in each case in an executive session without the presence of the CEO\nor the Executive Management.\nSubject to and within the bounds of the maximum compensation approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the CNC\nreviews and recommends for approval by the Board of Directors the annual base salary, incentive compensation (bonus)\nand equity compensation of the CEO, and in consultation with the CEO, of the Executive Management, and the overall\ncompensation of the CEO and the Executive Management. The CNC also requests approval by the Board of Directors\nregarding the determination of the compensation-related targets for the Executive Management and requests approval by\nthe Board of Directors of the individual compensation packages to be paid to members of the Executive Management.\nElements of Compensation for 2023\nBase Salary\nBase salaries are highly competitive in order to attract, motivate, and retain persons with the necessary skills and character.\nThe salary level is based on the scope of the position and market conditions and the individual’s profile in terms of\nexperience and skills. The fixed compensation for the Executive Management members includes base salary, social\nsecurity contributions and payments to the pension fund by the Company. Base salaries are reviewed annually by the CNC,\ntaking into account individual performance and the results of the external benchmarking.\nIncentive Plan (Bonus)\nThe CNC proposes to the Board of Directors an incentive compensation plan providing for variable compensation of the\nmembers of the Executive Management based on the achievement of the Company’s corporate goals and in relation to the\nExecutive Management based on the individuals’ performance and approves any changes to such plan as may be proposed\nby the CEO from time to time. The CNC reviews and approves any employment contracts, severance contracts, or other\nagreements that the Company proposes to enter into with any present, future, or former members of the Executive\nManagement, provided that the key terms of such contracts shall be submitted for approval by the Board of Directors and\nshall be within the bounds of the maximum compensation approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\nThe annual cash bonus for 2023 was based on the achievement of Company and individual goals. The target bonus (i.e.,\ncash bonus to be paid if 100% of corporate and individual objectives are met,) is determined individually for each\nmember of the Executive Management as a fixed amount, ranging from approximately 25% of the base salary. The 2023\ncorporate goals included: (i) fulfillment of various R&D milestones, (ii) advancement of several R&D pre-clinical and\nclinical programs, (iii) IPO listing of the company by Q1 and (iv) raising of additional capital. The weightings of the\ncorporate and individual goals are defined for each executive management member and vary depending on the position.\nIn general, the higher the position of an employee, the more weight is put on the achievement of corporate goals rather\nthan on individual goals. The Board determined that the actual target achievement of the 2023 corporate goals was 100%.\n6\nPension Plan and Social Charges\nPension Plan\nThe Company participates in a collective foundation covering all its employees including its executive officers. In\naddition to retirement benefits, the plan provides death or long-term disability benefits.\nContributions paid to the plan are computed as a percentage of salary, adjusted for the age of the employee, and shared\n50%/50% by employee and employer, respectively, except in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Marketing\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer where the split id 30%/70% by employee and employer, respectively. This plan is\ngoverned by the Swiss Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors and Disability Pension Plans (BVG), which\nrequires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. The fund has the legal form of a foundation, and it\nis governed by the Board of Trustees, which consists of an equal number of employer and employee representatives.\nThe Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment\nstrategy.\nSocial Charges\nThe Company pays old age and survivors’ insurance (AHV), Disability insurance (IV), Income replacement scheme (EO)\nand Accident Insurance (BU/NBU) as required by Federal Swiss law. The company also pays Supplementary Accident\nInsurance (UVGZ) and Sickness Daily Benefits Insurance (KTG).\nShare Option Plan\nShare Option Plan 2021\nThe Share Option Plan 2021 as of December 14, 2021 (the “2021 Plan”) was established for the officers, employees, non-\nemployee directors and consultants of NLS Pharmaceutics AG. The Board authorized, an increase in the maximum\nnumber of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan provides for an award of stock options.\nVesting and performance- based conditions vary by grant and are determined by the plan administrator, which is the\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer under specified delegation limitations\ngranted by the Board of Directors. However, option awards with an “Exercise Price” shall be determined at the time of\ngrant by the plan administrator but shall not be less than 100 percent of fair market value on the date of grant.
