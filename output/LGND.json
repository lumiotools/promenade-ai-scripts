This attachment\nincludes a general summary regarding certain U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations\nrelating to the effects of the Distribution and the Merger (each as defined below) on the tax\nbasis of shares of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (“Ligand”) common stock, the\nallocation of basis between shares of Ligand common stock and shares of OmniAb Operations,\nInc. (f/k/a OmniAb, Inc., “SpinCo”) common stock pursuant to the Distribution, and the tax\nbasis of shares of OmniAb, Inc. (f/k/a Avista Public Acquisition Corp. II, “APAC”) common\nstock and Earnout Shares (defined below) received in exchange for shares of SpinCo common\nstock pursuant to the Merger.\nDISCLAIMER: The information provided on Form 8937 and within this attachment is\nbased on the intended tax treatment of the Distribution as a distribution pursuant to Section\n355 of the Code and of the Merger as a reorganization qualifying under Section 368(a) of the\nCode, and does not constitute tax advice and does not purport to be complete or to describe\nthe consequences that may apply to particular categories of stockholders. Stockholders,\nincluding stockholders that hold different blocks of shares (i.e., shares acquired at different\ntimes or different prices), are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the\nDistribution and the Merger and the particular consequences to them, including the\napplicability and effect of all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax laws.\nPart II\nLine 14. Describe the organizational action and, if applicable, the date of the action or\nthe date against which shareholders’ ownership is measured for the action.\nOn November 1, 2022, Ligand completed the previously announced transaction to\ncombine the SpinCo business with APAC by distributing, on a pro rata basis, all of\nthe outstanding common stock of SpinCo to Ligand common stockholders of record\nas of October 26, 2022 (the “Distribution”). Pursuant to the Distribution, each\nholder of Ligand common stock received one share of SpinCo common stock for\nevery share of Ligand common stock held as of the record date.\nImmediately following the Distribution, a wholly owned subsidiary of APAC\nmerged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary\nof APAC (the “Merger”). In the Merger, each share of SpinCo common stock\nimmediately prior to the Merger was automatically converted into the right to\nreceive 4.90007 shares of APAC common stock and 0.75842 shares of APAC\ncommon stock subject to certain price-based earnout triggers (the “Earnout\nShares”).\nNo fractional shares of APAC common stock were issued in connection with the\nMerger. All fractional shares that a holder of SpinCo common stock would\notherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger were aggregated by\nan exchange agent and sold in the open market or otherwise as reasonably directed\nby APAC. The exchange agent made available the net proceeds thereof, after\ndeducting any required withholding taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and\ntransfer taxes, to the holders of shares of SpinCo common stock that would\notherwise have been entitled to receive such fractional shares of APAC common\nstock pursuant to the Merger.\nNo fractional Earnout Shares were issued in connection with the Merger. Holders\nof shares of SpinCo common stock that would otherwise have been entitled to\nreceive such fractional Earnout Shares pursuant to the Merger received no\nconsideration in lieu thereof.\nLine 15. Describe the quantitative effect of the organizational action on the basis of the\nsecurity in the hands of a U.S. taxpayer as an adjustment per share or as a\npercentage of old basis.\nLigand stockholders must allocate their aggregate tax basis in their shares of Ligand\ncommon stock held immediately prior to the Distribution among the shares of\nSpinCo common stock distributed in the Distribution and the shares of Ligand\ncommon stock in respect of which such shares of SpinCo common stock were\nreceived in proportion to their respective fair market values on the date of the\nDistribution.\nLigand stockholders will then have an aggregate tax basis in the shares of APAC\ncommon stock (including any fractional share deemed issued and sold for cash as\ndescribed below) and Earnout Shares received in the Merger that is equal to the\naggregate tax basis allocated to the shares of SpinCo common stock described\nabove. Each Ligand stockholder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of SpinCo\ncommon stock will be allocated among such shares of APAC common stock and\nEarnout Shares in proportion to their respective fair market values on the date of\nthe Merger. A SpinCo stockholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share\nof APAC common stock will be treated as having received the fractional share\npursuant to the Merger and then as having sold that fractional share for cash. As a\nresult, such stockholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between\nthe amount of the cash received for such fractional share and the tax basis allocated\nto such fractional share.\nLine 16. Describe the calculation of the change in basis and the data that supports the\ncalculation, such as the market values of securities and the valuation dates.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws provide that the allocation of the aggregate tax\nbasis in the Distribution discussed under Line 15 above is allocated based on the\nrespective fair market values of the resulting shares of Ligand and SpinCo common\nstock received. However, the tax law does not provide any further guidance on the\ndetermination of fair market value. One approach to determine the fair market value\nof Ligand is to use the average of the closing prices quoted on the Nasdaq exchange\non the first five days of trading following the Distribution, November 2, 2022\nthrough November 8, 2022. With respect to the shares of SpinCo common stock,\nbecause there were no public trading prices for the stand-alone SpinCo entity (i.e.,\nthere were only trading prices quoted for the post-Merger APAC entity), one\napproach to determine the fair market value of the shares of SpinCo common stock\nis to combine the value of (i) the average closing price for shares of APAC common\nstock quoted on the Nasdaq exchange on the first five days of trading following the\nDistribution, and adjust this share price to take into account the Merger base\nexchange ratio of 1 : 4.90007 SpinCo to APAC and (ii) the value of the Earnout\nShares as determined using a valuation model that accounts for the potential\nforfeiture of the Earnout Shares and adjust this value to take into account the\nearnout exchange ratio of 1 : 0.75842 SpinCo to Earnout Share. Using the average\nclosing price for shares of APAC common stock quoted on the Nasdaq exchange on\nthe first five days of trading following the Distribution ($2.33) and taking into\naccount the Merger base exchange ratio of 1 : 4.90007 SpinCo to APAC ($11.40)\nand the average closing price for shares of Ligand common stock quoted on the\nNasdaq exchange on the first five days of trading following the Distribution\n($65.12), and the value of the Earnout Shares as determined using a valuation model\nthat accounts for the potential forfeiture of the Earnout Shares ($1.00), and taking\ninto account the earnout exchange ratio of 1 : 0.75842 SpinCo to Earnout Share\n($0.76), approximately 15.73% of the aggregate tax basis held by the Ligand\nstockholders immediately prior to the Distribution would be allocated to the shares\nof SpinCo common stock received by such stockholders (($11.40 + $0.76) / ($11.40\n+ $0.76 + $65.12) = 15.73%).\nWith respect to the Merger, Ligand stockholders will have an aggregate tax basis in\nthe shares of APAC common stock (including basis allocated to any fractional shares\ndeemed issued and sold for cash, as described above) and Earnout Shares received\nin the Merger that is equal to the aggregate tax basis allocated to the shares of\nSpinCo common stock as described above, with such basis allocated among APAC\ncommon stock and Earnout Shares in proportion to their respective fair market\nvalues on the date of the Merger. However, the tax law does not provide any further\nguidance on the determination of fair market value. One approach is to use the\naverage closing price for shares of APAC common stock quoted on the Nasdaq\nexchange on the first five days of trading following the Distribution, and adjust this\nshare price to take into account the Merger base exchange ratio of 1 : 4.90007\nSpinCo to APAC and use the value of the Earnout Shares as determined using a\nvaluation model that accounts for the potential forfeiture of the Earnout Shares and\nadjust this value to take into account the earnout exchange ratio of 1 : 0.75842\nSpinCo to Earnout Share.\nOther approaches to determine fair market value may also be possible. Ligand\nstockholders are not bound by the approaches illustrated above and may, in\nconsultation with their own tax advisor, use an alternative approach in determining\nfair market values for shares of Ligand common stock, shares of SpinCo common\nstock and Earnout Shares. Ligand stockholders should contact their tax advisor to\ndetermine the appropriate fair market values.\nThe following is an example illustrating how the methodology outlined above\nwould be applied in determining tax basis allocation.\nExample: Assume a U.S. stockholder owned 1,000 shares of Ligand common\nstock, which were acquired with an aggregate tax basis of $10,000 (or $10 per\nshare).\nPursuant to the Distribution, such U.S. stockholder received 1,000 shares of SpinCo\ncommon stock. Taking into account the assumed relative fair market values noted\nabove, the U.S. stockholder would have 1,000 shares of SpinCo common stock with\nan aggregate tax basis of $1,573 ($10,000 x 15.73%). In addition, the U.S.\nstockholder’s aggregate basis in the 1,000 shares of Ligand common stock\ncorrespondingly would be reduced to $8,427 ($10,000 x 84.27%).\nPursuant to the Merger, such U.S. stockholder received (i) 4,900.07 shares of\nAPAC common stock (1,000 shares of SpinCo common stock x 4.90007), which\nincludes the 0.07 fractional share of APAC common stock deemed received by the\nU.S. stockholder and sold for cash and (ii) 758 Earnout Shares (1,000 shares of\nSpinCo common stock x 0.75842, with no fractional shares or consideration in lieu\nthereof).\nAs a result, prior to the deemed sale of the fractional share of APAC common stock,\nthe U.S. stockholder would have 4,900.07 shares of APAC common stock with an\naggregate tax basis of $1,474.92 (($11.40) / ($11.40 + $0.76 + $65.12) = 14.7492%\nx $10,000 = $1,474.92), or $0.30 per share ($1,474.92 divided by 4,900.07 shares)\nand (ii) 758 Earnout Shares with an aggregate tax basis of $98.14 (($0.76) / ($11.40\n+ $0.76 + $65.12) = 0.9814% x $10,000 = $98.14), or $0.13 per share ($98.14\ndivided by 758 shares).\nLine 17. List the applicable Internal Revenue Code section(s) and subsection(s) upon\nwhich the tax treatment is based.\nThe applicable Code sections upon which the tax treatment is based are Sections\n354, 355, 358, 368, 1001 and 1223.\nLine 18. Can any resulting loss be recognized?\nThe Distribution is intended to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under\nSection 355 of the Code and the Merger is intended to qualify for non-recognition\nof gain or loss under Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, a U.S. stockholder\nshould not recognize any gain or loss in the Distribution or Merger (except for any\ngain or loss attributable to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of APAC\ncommon stock in the Merger).\nLine 19. Provide any other information necessary to implement the adjustment, such\nas the reportable tax year.\nThe stock basis adjustments are taken into account in the taxable year of a Ligand\nstockholder during which the Distribution and the Merger occurred (e.g., 2022 for\ncalendar year taxpayers)."
