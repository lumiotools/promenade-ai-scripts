(NasdaqGS: GIII) today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 ended July 31, 2024.\n\nMorris Goldfarb, G-III’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a strong first half of the year. Our second quarter non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.52 exceeded our expectations, led by our owned brands. DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld collectively grew double-digits and the Donna Karan relaunch has been incredibly successful, in addition to continued solid performance with healthy sell-throughs across the rest of our business.”\n\nMr. Goldfarb concluded, “Having the most desirable brands is central to our strategy and I am pleased with the transition to our go-forward portfolio, which will continue to evolve for the future. Our new businesses are working, and I am excited to announce a licensing agreement for Converse, Inc., a globally recognized American youth lifestyle brand. This new partnership represents a significant opportunity to expand our active lifestyle category while leveraging our core capabilities to build a global apparel business. The powerful combination of our brands, our business model and diverse growth drivers, together with our agility, operating discipline and strong foundation give us confidence that our strategy will deliver long-term shareholder value.”\n\nMr. Goldfarb concluded, “Given our second quarter earnings per diluted share outperformance, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2025 net sales and, once again, raising our earnings per diluted share outlook. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain optimistic about the remainder of the year and our orderbook is in a good position for the important Fall and Holiday seasons.”\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n_Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results_\n\n**Net sales** for the second quarter ended July 31, 2024 decreased 2% to $644.8 million compared to $659.8 million in the prior year’s second quarter.\n\n**Net income** for the second quarter was $24.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $16.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the prior year’s second quarter.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income per diluted share** was $0.52 for the second quarter compared to $0.40 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes (i) in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the $0.6 million gain on the forgiveness of certain liabilities related to the acquisition of the minority interest of our DKNY business in China that we did not already own, (ii) in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, incentive compensation expenses of $1.8 million related to the Karl Lagerfeld transaction and (iii) in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, non-cash imputed interest expense of $1.1 million related to the note issued to seller as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Donna Karan International. The aggregate effect of these exclusions was equal to $(0.01) per diluted share in the second quarter of this year and $0.05 per diluted share in last year’s second quarter.\n\n_Balance Sheet as of Second Quarter Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Inventories** decreased 24% to $610.5 million at the end of this year’s second quarter compared to $804.9 million in the second quarter of last year.\n\nDuring the quarter, we bought back 1,180,328 of our shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $31.6 million.\n\n**Converse License**\n\nG-III signed a license agreement for Converse, Inc. to design and produce men’s and women’s apparel for distribution globally. The product is expected to launch in Fall 2025. Converse is an iconic American youth lifestyle brand and represents a significant opportunity for G-III to expand the active lifestyle business, providing exposure to a differentiated consumer and distribution network while leveraging existing fashion talent.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company today updated its outlook for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. This outlook continues to anticipate approximately $60.0 million in incremental expenses, primarily associated with the launches of Donna Karan, Nautica and Halston. Approximately 65% of these expenses are related to marketing initiatives to support the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. The remaining costs are principally related to technology and talent to expand operational capabilities.\n\n_Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Net sales** are expected to increase by approximately 3% to $3.20 billion (unchanged to prior guidance), compared to net sales of $3.10 billion for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Net income** is expected to be between $179.0 million and $184.0 million (prior $170.0 million and $175.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $3.94 and $4.04 (prior $3.58 and $3.68). This compares to net income of $176.2 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income** for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $180.0 million and $185.0 million (prior $170.0 and $175.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $3.95 and $4.05 (prior $3.58 and $3.68). This compares to non-GAAP net income of $189.8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.04 for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $305.0 million and $310.0 million (prior $295.0 million and $300.0 million) compared to adjusted EBITDA of $324.1 million in fiscal 2024.\n\n**Net interest expense** is expected to be approximately $24.0 million, including a $1.7 million non-GAAP charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of our senior secured notes. We estimate a tax rate of 28.5% for fiscal 2025.\n\n_Third Quarter Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Net sales** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 are expected to increase by approximately 3% to $1.10 billion compared to $1.07 billion in the same period last year.\n\n**Net income** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of $97.0 million and $102.0 million, or diluted earnings per share between $2.18 and $2.28. This compares to net income of $127.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.74, in last year’s third quarter.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $98.0 million and $103.0 million, or diluted earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.30. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $129.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.78, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nReconciliations of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share and GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA are presented in tables accompanying the financial statements included in this release and provide useful information to evaluate the Company’s operational performance. A description of the amounts excluded on a non-GAAP basis are provided in conjunction with these tables. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light of the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**About G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.**\n\nG-III Apparel Group, Ltd., a global leader in fashion with expertise in design, sourcing and marketing, owns and licenses a portfolio of over 30 preeminent brands.

The aggregate effect of these exclusions was equal to $(0.01) per diluted share in the second quarter of this year and $0.05 per diluted share in last year’s second quarter.\n\n_Balance Sheet as of Second Quarter Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Inventories** decreased 24% to $610.5 million at the end of this year’s second quarter compared to $804.9 million in the second quarter of last year.\n\nDuring the quarter, we bought back 1,180,328 of our shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $31.6 million.\n\n**Converse License**\n\nG-III signed a license agreement for Converse, Inc. to design and produce men’s and women’s apparel for distribution globally. The product is expected to launch in Fall 2025. Converse is an iconic American youth lifestyle brand and represents a significant opportunity for G-III to expand the active lifestyle business, providing exposure to a differentiated consumer and distribution network while leveraging existing fashion talent.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company today updated its outlook for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. This outlook continues to anticipate approximately $60.0 million in incremental expenses, primarily associated with the launches of Donna Karan, Nautica and Halston. Approximately 65% of these expenses are related to marketing initiatives to support the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. The remaining costs are principally related to technology and talent to expand operational capabilities.\n\n_Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Net sales** are expected to increase by approximately 3% to $3.20 billion (unchanged to prior guidance), compared to net sales of $3.10 billion for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Net income** is expected to be between $179.0 million and $184.0 million (prior $170.0 million and $175.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $3.94 and $4.04 (prior $3.58 and $3.68). This compares to net income of $176.2 million, or $3.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income** for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $180.0 million and $185.0 million (prior $170.0 and $175.0 million), or diluted earnings per share between $3.95 and $4.05 (prior $3.58 and $3.68). This compares to non-GAAP net income of $189.8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.04 for fiscal 2024.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $305.0 million and $310.0 million (prior $295.0 million and $300.0 million) compared to adjusted EBITDA of $324.1 million in fiscal 2024.\n\n**Net interest expense** is expected to be approximately $24.0 million, including a $1.7 million non-GAAP charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of our senior secured notes. We estimate a tax rate of 28.5% for fiscal 2025.\n\n_Third Quarter Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Net sales** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 are expected to increase by approximately 3% to $1.10 billion compared to $1.07 billion in the same period last year.\n\n**Net income** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of $97.0 million and $102.0 million, or diluted earnings per share between $2.18 and $2.28. This compares to net income of $127.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.74, in last year’s third quarter.\n\n**Non-GAAP net income** for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $98.0 million and $103.0 million, or diluted earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.30. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $129.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.78, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nReconciliations of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share and GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA are presented in tables accompanying the financial statements included in this release and provide useful information to evaluate the Company’s operational performance.
