          "content": "Rain Enhancement Technologies – Innovator in Rainfall Generation Technology –\nto Become Publicly Traded through a Business Combination with Coliseum\nAcquisition Corp.\n• Rain Enhancement Technologies, Inc. (“RET”) has entered into a business combination agreement\nwith Coliseum Acquisition Corp.; once the business combination is completed, it is intended that\nthe combined company will be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RAIN.”\n• RET aims to develop, manufacture and commercialize ionization rainfall generation technology to\nprovide additional rainfall for the energy, agriculture, logistics, transportation, decarbonization,\nand food industries, as well as supranational organizations, countries and localities.\n• The transaction values RET at a pre-closing valuation of $45 million.\nNAPLES, FL and NEW YORK, NY June 26, 2024 – Rain Enhancement Technologies, Inc. (“RET” or the\n“Company”), an emerging company developing rainfall generation technology, and Coliseum Acquisition\nCorp. (NASDAQ:MITA) (“Coliseum”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, today\nannounced that they have entered into a business combination agreement. Upon closing, it is intended\nthat the combined company will be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RAIN.”\nWater Supply and Demand Imbalance Worsening\nWater scarcity is a pervasive challenge affecting primary components of global ecosystems such as energy,\nagriculture, logistics, transportation, decarbonization, and food. Almost two thirds of the world’s\npopulation experiences water scarcity for at least one month each year and the gap in supply of water\nand demand is expected to grow to 40% by 2030.\nThe compounding effects of water shortages are driving acceleration for solutions that are proven,\nscalable, sustainable and economical. In the U.S., states are using a portion of the funds allocated to them\nthrough the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for cloudseeding projects. Cloudseeding projects are\nnow under way in Texas, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico and California. Further, in 2022, the\nUAE spent $10.3B on desalination projects.\nRET aims to develop, manufacture and commercialize ionization rainfall generation technology to provide\nadditional rainfall for industries, supranational organizations, countries and localities. The Company’s\nionization technology is rooted in simple, existing physics theory using natural conditions, and has robust\ndatasets produced and evaluated during prior trials by third parties. In a six-year randomized third-party\ntrial conducted from 2013 to 2018 in Oman, an ionization rainfall generation system generated an average\nof approximately 16% of additional rainfall, according to results published by the National Institute for\nApplied Statistics Research Australia (“NIASRA”), a third party research organization, in the International\nStatistical Review. RET has licensed the engineering designs for the equipment and systems used in the\ntrials.\nThe Company’s commercial team has developed relationships with private organizations, country leaders\nand major agriculture companies to build a robust pipeline of potential customers. RET management\nbelieves the Company is well-positioned for the development, innovation, and scaling of its proprietary\nrainfall generation technology.\nRET is led by Chris Riley, a veteran C-suite leader with experience spanning both public and private sector\ncompanies. Mr. Riley brings a wealth of leadership experience accumulated over more than three decades\nin various technology sectors, including IT, Cloud, Security, Automation and AI. Previously, he served as\nPresident, Worldwide Field Operations for DataRobot, as Chief Revenue Officer and Strategic Advisor to\nthe CEO at Automation Anywhere, and in varying roles at Dell, Dell/EMC and EMC (NYSE: Dell, formerly\nNYSE: EMC), including President Americas Sales and Customer Operations, President Dell Technologies\nSelect and SVP Global Alliances. During his tenure at Dell, Mr. Riley led the $20B+ Americas business\nthrough one of their largest and most successful technology acquisitions of all time. With a proven track\nrecord of driving revenue growth, expanding gross margins, and establishing lasting customer\nrelationships and ecosystem partnerships, Mr. Riley is poised to lead RET into its next chapter of growth,\ninnovation, global expansion, and market leadership.\nRET has established a strategic roadmap and multiple vectors for development, innovation and\nenhancement. In addition to its exclusive license of certain relevant underlying IP, the Company intends\nto draw on the services of leading engineers, scientists, climatologists and experts in the water technology\nand rainfall generation space. Recent advancements in understanding cloud condensation nuclei and\nmore precise weather forecasting serve as catalysts for increasing the potential enhancement of RET’s\ntechnology, creating even greater confidence in the efficacy of the ionization approach. This foundation\nis expected to empower RET’s management to swiftly establish commercial alliances with private\nindustries and governments, while involving key stakeholders invested in ecosystem maintenance and\nrestoration in water-stressed areas across the world.\n“The world desperately needs enhanced water resources in order to meet massive and rapidly growing\ndemand,” said Chris Riley, CEO of RET. “Entering into this agreement to merge with Coliseum represents\na decisive step towards delivering on our vision to be a pioneering force in the water and climate\nadaptation space. RET aims to accelerate our growth plans and commercialize a robust rain enhancement\nplatform, in part by leveraging the added financial strength we anticipate from going public.”\n“We are confident that RET’s innovative rainfall ionization platform is uniquely positioned to meet the\nmassive market demand from private industries and governments around the globe,” said Charles Wert,\nChief Executive Officer of Coliseum. “With the necessary capital, we believe RET can successfully scale\nand lead this emerging and critical market sector.”\nTransaction Overview\nRET has a pre-closing valuation of $45 million.\nColiseum had approximately $31 million in cash held in its trust account as of March 31, 2024. The balance\nremaining after redemptions and transaction expenses will be used for funding development, innovation\nand commercial scale.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.\nManagement and Governance\nRET’s management team, led by CEO Chris Riley, will continue to lead the public company following the\ntransaction.\nAdvisors\nTCF Law Group, PLLC is acting as legal counsel to RET.\nWhite & Case LLP is acting as legal counsel to Coliseum.\nAbout Rain Enhancement Technologies, Inc.\nRET was founded to provide the world with reliable access to water, one of life’s most important\nresources. To achieve this mission, RET aims to develop, manufacture and commercialize ionization\nrainfall generation technology. This weather modification technology seeks to provide the world with\nreliable access to water, and transform business, society and the planet for the better.\nAbout Coliseum Acquisition Corp.\nColiseum Acquisition Corp. is a special purpose acquisition company whose business purpose is to\neffectuate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar\nbusiness combination with one or more businesses.\nAdditional Information about the Business Combination and Where to Find it\nIn connection with the business combination, Rain Enhancement Technologies Holdco, a Massachusetts\ncorporation (“Holdco”) intends to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a\nregistration statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”), which will include a preliminary proxy\nstatement of Coliseum and a preliminary prospectus of Holdco, referred to as a proxy\nstatement/prospectus.

(“Coliseum” or “SPAC”) to assist interested\nparties in making their own evaluation with respect to a potential business combination between the Company and Coliseum and related transactions (the “Potential Business Combination”) and for no other purpose.\nCertain Risks Related to Coliseum and the Company:\nThe risks presented below are certain of the general risks related to Coliseum, as well as the Company’s technology, business, industry and ownership structure and are not exhaustive. These risks speak only as of the date of this presentation and\nthe Company makes no commitment to update such disclosure. The risks highlighted in future filings with the SEC may differ significantly from and will be more extensive than those presented below.\n• The Company can provide no assurance of the effectiveness and success of ionization rainfall generation technology in increasing precipitation;\n• The Company has no operating history and has not yet generated any revenues, which makes it difficult to forecast its future results of operations;\n• The Company expects to incur significant expenses and losses for the foreseeable future; The Company’s growth is dependent upon its ability to successfully acquire customers and support and service its customers;\n• The Company may not manage growth effectively;\n• The Company may need additional capital to pursue its business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, and it cannot be sure that additional financing will be available;\n• The execution of the Company’s business model, including technology or profitability of its products and services, is not yet proven;\n• The Company has not demonstrated it can develop rainfall generation technology and faces barriers in replicating meaningful rainfall generation. If the Company cannot successfully overcome those barriers, its business will be negatively impacted\nand could fail;\n• The markets for rainfall generation-related products are in nascent stages, and the Company may have limited opportunities to license its technologies or sell its products. A substantial portion of existing ionization rainfall generation technology is\nderived from public-source intellectual property and as a result the Company may face increased competition;\n• Even if the Company is successful in developing rainfall generation systems/technology and executing its strategy, other competitors in the industry may achieve technological breakthroughs which render the Company’s technology obsolete or\ninferior to other products;\n• If the Company’s platform fails to provide a broad, proven advantage in rainfall generation, its business, financial condition and future prospects may be harmed;\n• The Company’s operating and financial results relies upon assumptions and analyses developed by third-party trials. If these assumptions or analyses prove to be incorrect, the Company’s actual operating results may be materially different from\nits forecasted results;\n• The Company’s estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of revenue generation and market growth, including the ability to meet the supply and demand needs of its customers, may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which it\noperates achieves the forecasted growth, the Company’s business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all;\n• The Company may be unable to successfully manufacture its products or scale up manufacturing of its products in sufficient quantity and quality, in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Unforeseen issues associated with scaling up and\nconstructing rainfall generation systems at commercially viable levels could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations;\n• The Company could suffer disruptions, outages, defects and other performance and quality problems with its rainfall generation systems or the infrastructure on which it relies;\n• The Company will be dependent on its suppliers and manufacturers, and supply chain issues could delay the introduction of the Company’s product and negatively impact its business and operating results;\n• The Company’s failure to effectively develop and expand its sales and marketing capabilities could harm its ability to increase its customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of its rain generation technology;\n• The Company’s operations, projects and prospects are expected to be located in remote areas, and its production, processing and product delivery will rely on the infrastructure and skilled labor being adequate and remaining available;\n• The Company’s business is dependent on the international market prices of energy and fiberglass, among other materials, which are both cyclical and volatile;\n• The risk of third parties asserting that the Company is violating their intellectual property rights;\n• The Company must overcome significant engineering, technology, operations and climatological challenges to deliver consistent results;\n• Risks relating to the effect of competing technologies, including desalination and chemical-based cloudseeding technology, on the Company’s business;\n• Risks relating to environmental and weather conditions that are correlated with successful rainfall generation, as well as other ESG-related matters;\n• The Company may face liability for changing environmental and/or weather conditions, including challenges resulting from excessive rain;\n• Risks relating to the failures of the Company’s customers, both private and public, to meet payment obligations, including refusal to pay for rainfall generator services that directly or indirectly benefit other nearby parties;\n• Risks of system securities and data protection breaches;\n• The Company is highly dependent on its senior technical advisors, and its ability to attract, recruit, and retain senior management, members of its board of directors and other key employees, as well as find qualified labor with the particular skills\nrequired to manufacture, operate and advance the platform, is critical to its success; if the Company is unable to retain talented, highly-qualified senior management and other key employees or attract them when needed, it could negatively impact\nits business;\n• Risks regarding potential changes in legislative and regulatory environments that may limit the scope of the Company’s marketplace, including land restriction policies and its ability to obtain and maintain permits;\n41\nTM\nRisk Factors (Cont’d)\n• The Company may face political, regulatory and social opposition to its business and activities;\n• Following the consummation of the Potential Business Combination, Holdco will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could negatively impact its business, financial condition and results of\noperations;\n• The Company’s success could be impacted by the inability of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the Potential Business Combination, including the risk that the expected benefits of the Potential Business Combination are not\nrealized;\n• If the Potential Business Combination's benefits do not its meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of Coliseum’s securities or, following the closing, Holdco’s securities, may decline;\n• Coliseum’s sponsors and directors have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that shareholders vote in favor of approval of the Potential Business Combination and related proposals;\n• Coliseum’s sponsors have agreed to vote in favor of the Potential Business Combination, regardless of how Coliseum’s public shareholders vote;\n• If Coliseum is unable to complete the Potential Business Combination with the Company or another business by September 25, 2024, Coliseum will cease all operations except for purposes of winding up, dissolving and liquidating, in which case\nits public shareholders may only receive approximately $10.00 per share and its warrants will expire worthless. Further, third parties may bring claims against Coliseum, and as a result, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and\nthe per share liquidation price received by shareholders could be less than $10.00 per share;\n• Coliseum has conducted due diligence to assess the management of the Company’s business but cannot assure you that the Company’s management has all the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company; and the\nability of shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of Coliseum’s outstanding public shares could increase the probability that the Potential Business Combination would be unsuccessful and that the shareholders\nwould have to wait for liquidation to redeem their public shares.\n42\nTM"
