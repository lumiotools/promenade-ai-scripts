Third-party trademarks mentioned are the property of their respective owners. The use of the word partner does not imply a partnership relationship between Cisco and any other company. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"strives,\" \"goal,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"endeavors,\" \"continues,\" \"projects,\" \"seeks,\" or \"targets,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, as well as similar expressions) should be considered to be forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are management's beliefs and assumptions, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain, and outside of management's control. Forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the expected benefits to Cisco, Splunk and their respective customers from the completed transaction, the integration of Splunk's and Cisco's complementary capabilities to create an end-to-end platform designed to unlock greater digital resilience for customers, plans for future investment and capital allocation, and the expected financial performance of Cisco following the completed transaction. Statements regarding future events are based on Cisco's current expectations, estimates, and projections and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to, among other things, (i) the ability of Cisco to successfully integrate Splunk's market opportunities, technology, personnel and operations and to achieve expected benefits, (ii) Cisco's ability to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Splunk's business and realize expected synergies, (iii) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction, (iv) the effects on the accounting relating to the acquisition of Splunk, (v) legislative, regulatory, and economic developments, (vi) general economic conditions, and (vii) the retention of key personnel. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from the anticipated results or outcomes indicated in any forward-looking statements. For information regarding other related risks, see the \"Risk Factors\" section of Cisco's most recent report on Form 10-Q filed on February 20, 2024 and its most recent report on Form 10-K filed on September 7, 2023, as well as the \"Risk Factors\" section of Splunk's most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 28, 2023. The parties undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Information** This press release includes future estimated cash flow, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP EPS information.\n\nPositive or accretive cash flow is the Company's incremental cash flow from operations anticipated to result from the transaction including cash flow from Splunk's operations, expected synergies, and financing costs (including foregone interest income), and excluding certain transaction costs, cash payments related to the one-time conversion of Splunk employee equity awards, and cash retention awards.\n\nNon-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. We have not reconciled future estimated cash flow, non-GAAP gross margin, or non-GAAP EPS information included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort because we do not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n[ ![Cisco Splunk Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2364342/Cisco_Splunk_Lockup.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2364342/Cisco_Splunk_Lockup.html)\n\n[ ![Cisco Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Cisco\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/813707/Cisco_v2_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/813707/Cisco_v2_Logo.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF63291&sd=2024-03-18) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cisco-completes-acquisition-of-splunk-302091484.html>\n\nSOURCE Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.cisco.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Contact\n\nTo contact Cisco Investor Relations:\n\n##### Investor Relations Department\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. 170 West Tasman Drive San Jose, CA 95134-170 USA Phone: (408) 227-CSCO Fax: (408) 853-3683 To email Cisco IR, please click [here](/resources-and-faqs/faqs/default.aspx) and scroll to the bottom of the page \n\nTo report a change of address or lost stock certificate, or to request account information, please contact our transfer agent:\n\n##### Computershare Investor Services\n\nP.O.

This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, joined by\nChuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Cisco's earnings press release\nand supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on\nour Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and\nslides available on the website.\nThroughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We\nwill discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of\nproduct orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis.\nPlease note that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including our\nguidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. These statements are subject to risks and\nuncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K report, which\nidentifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in our forward-looking statements.\nWith respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for\nfurther details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is\ndone through an explicit public disclosure.\nNow, I'll turn it over to Chuck.\nOpening Remarks\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. Cisco delivered a strong start to fiscal\n2025, delivering $13.8 billion in revenue for the first quarter, coming in at the high end of our\nguidance range. This was supported by solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining\nperformance obligations and subscription revenue, which now accounts for 57% of our total\nrevenue. The strength of our recurring revenue streams is helping to fuel our profitability. Non-\nGAAP EPS of $0.91 exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by the highest non-\nGAAP gross margin we have seen in more than 20 years, which was further enhanced by Splunk.\nThe combination of Cisco and Splunk and our teams' great execution are both driving our strong\noperating leverage. The strength of our operating performance and free cash flow in Q1 fueled a\nreturn of $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends,\ndelivering on our commitment to consistent capital returns.\nBuilding on the growing demand we saw at the end of fiscal year 2024, product orders grew 20%\nyear-over-year in Q1 and were up 9% organically. This is an acceleration of the 14% product\norder growth we saw just three months ago, and is a clear sign of normalizing demand for\nCisco's innovation.\nNow, let me share some details on our first quarter, starting with the demand environment.\nEnterprise product orders were up 33%, driven by particularly strong performance in the\nAmericas and EMEA across a broad range of customers. We saw continued strong momentum in\nservice provider and cloud, with product orders up 28%, driven by triple-digit growth in\nwebscale.\nIn Q1, our webscale customers placed AI infrastructure orders in excess of $300 million. Our AI\npipeline continued to be strong. We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we\nwill exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from webscale customers.\nAfter a very strong Q4 last quarter, public sector orders were up 2% year-over-year in Q1.\nFederal spending in the US was lower year-over-year due to continuing resolutions discussions,\nthe impact of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the diversion of funds within US federal. It's\nimportant to note that we believe the deals we are working on with US federal customers are\nsimply delayed, not lost. In both EMEA and APJC, year- over-year public sector order growth\nwas strong. Now, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products to provide\nsome incremental color.\nOur Networking portfolio saw double-digit product order growth overall, driven by switching,\nwireless and Internet infrastructure. Looking at data center switching in particular, we have seen\nthree consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth and an acceleration from Q4 into Q1.\nThis shows our competitive strength in this key market and the power of our Nexus brand and\nthe build out of private cloud infrastructure by our customers. We expect this momentum to\ncontinue, as customers are showing significant interest in our 400-gig and 800-gig switches\nbased on Silicon One.\nSecurity orders more than doubled year-over-year, driven by the advanced threat intelligence\ncapabilities of Splunk. Excluding Splunk, growth in security product orders was driven by our\nrenewed security strategy and new product pipeline, which continues to be well received by\ncustomers and analysts. We continue to see momentum around our new security products like\nXDR, Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, with now over 1,000 customers deploying these\nproducts thus far.\nIn Q1, we had a marquee win for over 75,000 cloud security seats, with a multinational IT\nservices and consultancy company. The customer largely replaced an SSE competitor with our\nsolution and moved from planning to implementation in 120 days, highlighting how fast our\nteams can implement our solutions at scale. We also booked our first seven-figure Hypershield\ndeal in Q1.\nCollaboration product orders grew double-digits again driven by demand for devices and our\nCloud Webex Suite. Finally, in Observability, orders were up high-single digits driven by our\nNetwork Assurance solution, ThousandEyes and Splunk Observability.\nI'd also like to highlight some of the progress we've made integrating Splunk. We now have a\ndozen updated data integrations between Cisco and Splunk across our Security and Networking\nportfolio, including Secure Firewall, Catalyst Center, SD-WAN and ICE. We continue our joint\nselling motions between Cisco and Splunk, including Cisco Secure Network Analytics and XDR\nalongside Splunk's SIEM offering enhanced capabilities to the security operations center. We\nalso continue to build our market-leading observability solutions to accelerate full stack\nobservability for the enterprise.\nOverall, our Q1 results highlight continued strong demand for Cisco technologies, driven by the\nneed for modern resilient networks as AI begins to scale. Findings from our new global AI\npartner study show that IT partners around the world are anticipating a transformative wave of\nAI technology demand, driven by infrastructure, cybersecurity and customer experience, which\nthey expect to fuel the majority of their revenue over the next four to five years.\nWith the breadth of our portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this AI technology\ndemand, as customers are investing in their critical infrastructure to prepare for AI. In fact, there\nare three distinct but connected pillars to the AI networking opportunity for Cisco, which we\nhave outlined on a slide as part of our quarterly materials.\nFirst, AI training infrastructure for webscale customers. AI networks demand scalable,\nprogrammable, low- power switches with advanced load balancing and observability. These\ncharacteristics in our products are driving hyperscalers to deploy the Cisco 8000 with Cisco\nSilicon One G200 for maximum power efficiency in their back-end AI training networks. As\nfurther proof, we also won a new super spine AI networking use case with one of our webscale\ncustomers this quarter.\nSecond, AI network connectivity. This quarter, we booked further platform sales with global\nenterprise customers, who are leveraging our technology platforms to modernize and automate\ntheir network operations to prepare for large-scale connectivity to AI applications. Our\ntechnology platforms across switching, routing, security, and observability will help enable our\ncustomers by leveraging cutting-edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched\nsupply chain visibility.\nThird, AI network inference and enterprise clouds. Most of the CIOs and technology leaders we\ntalk to say that their organizations are planning full GenAI adoption within the next two years.\nYet only 13% of organizations say their infrastructure is ready for AI today, according to the\nCisco AI Readiness Index. To help our customers prepare, we have announced two new\nadditions to our data center infrastructure portfolio, a\nnew NVIDIA-based AI server and AI PODs, including NVIDIA's AI enterprise cloud native\nsoftware platform and managed through Cisco Intersight to simplify and de-risk AI infrastructure\ndeployment. Our new AI server is expected to begin shipping next month, and our AI PODs are\norderable this month.\nIn addition, HyperFabric, our fabric-as-a-service solution, which is expected to be available in\nearly calendar 2025, further simplifies infrastructure deployment and management, while\nproviding real-time visibility into network performance. With these solutions, we are bringing\nthe power of open hyperscale AI networking to the enterprise.\nWe also continue to fuse AI capabilities into our products. Hypershield, our first truly distributed\nAI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network shows how we are delivering\nsecured networking, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats.\nSplunk's asset and risk intelligence solution is another example of how we are providing insights\nto help customers understand their security maturity and demonstrate compliance with evolving\nregulations.\nIn our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced the Webex AI Agent, AI Agent Studio and\nCisco AI Assistant features for Webex Contact Center. These solutions use advanced\nconversational intelligence and automation to improve overall customer satisfaction. We have\nseen strong initial interest from customers and will continue to strengthen our Collaboration\nproducts, increasing AI capabilities.\nWe're also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience\norganization. Over 60% of our technical assistance center support cases are now touched by AI-\nenabled automation backed by our expertise for faster resolutions, which is leading to higher\ncustomer satisfaction scores. In addition, our internal AI Assistant for TAC works alongside our\nengineers to improve quality and speed time to resolution, while allowing our people to work on\nmore complex and creative problem solving.\nTo summarize, as we look at what's occurring with AI, there are three key things happening.\nFirst, there is significant investment in back-end AI networks with hyperscalers focused on\ntraining. Second, as enterprises look to adopt and deploy AI, they need to modernize and secure\ntheir infrastructure to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI applications. Finally, the\ncombination of mature back-end models with enterprise AI application deployment will lead to\nincreased capacity requirements on both private and public front-end cloud networks. Cisco is\nalready playing a major role across all three of these significant opportunities and are uniquely\npositioned to win with the breadth of our product portfolio and our trusted customer\nrelationships.\nI will now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nFinancial Overview\nThanks, Chuck. We executed well in Q1 with strong order momentum, margins and operating\ncash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $13.8\nbillion, down 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 of fiscal 2024 was the last quarter of\nsignificantly elevated backlog shipments.\nNon-GAAP net income was $3.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high\nend of our guidance range at $0.91.\nLooking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.1 billion, down 9%\nand service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking was down 23%, primarily driven by\nthe elevated level of shipment we saw a year ago. As Chuck said, we saw strong order growth\nacross our networking products as customers have worked down inventory and deployed the\nnetworking products we shipped them last year.\nSecurity was up 100%, primarily driven by growth in our Threat Intelligence, Detection and\nResponse offerings, which includes the offerings from Splunk, Network Security and SASE.\nExcluding Splunk, Security grew 2%, and our Security portfolio was particularly impacted by\nthe delays in spending in US Fed.\nCollaboration was down 3%, driven by declines in our on-prem Webex Suite and Collaboration\nDevices, partially offset by growth in our Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. Observability was\nup 36%, driven primarily by Observability Suite and growth in network assurance offerings.\nExcluding Splunk, Observability grew 1% for the quarter.\nLooking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.9 billion, which increased 22%\nwith product ARR growth of 42%. Total subscription revenue increased 21% to $7.8 billion,\nrepresenting 57% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 24% at $5.5 billion,\nwith software subscription revenue up 35%. Total RPO was $40 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\nProduct RPO grew 24% and total short-term RPO was up 15% to $20.3 billion.\nQ1 product orders were up 20% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 9%\nyear-over-year. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments, the Americas was\nup 17%, EMEA was up 26%, and APJC was up 25%. In our customer markets, enterprise is up\n33%, service provider and cloud was up 28%, and public sector was up 2%.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 69.3%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and\nexceeding the high end of our guidance range and reaching the highest level in more than 20\nyears. Product gross margin was 68.9%, up 240 basis points, driven by Splunk, favorable product\nmix, productivity improvements, and the one- time benefit of duty drawback, partially offset by\nprice. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 130 basis points.\nWe continued our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating\nmargin above the high end of our guidance range at 34.1%. On the bottom line, Q1 non-GAAP\nnet income was $3.7 billion and earnings per share were $0.91.\nShifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of\n$18.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 54%. From a capital allocation\nperspective, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter, comprised of $1.6\nbillion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2 billion of share repurchases.\nWe continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we\nclosed two software acquisitions, DeepFactor to accelerate innovation in the Cisco Security\nCloud and augment our Secure Access offerings, and Robust Intelligence, which brings enhanced\nprotection for AI models throughout their life cycle from development to production.\nAdditionally, we announced our intent to acquire Deeper Insights AI to expand our customer\nexperience team's technology footprint and engineering talent, accelerating innovation and\nmomentum of Cisco's CX AI capabilities and services. These investments are highly\ncomplementary to our internal R&D and align with our strategy to strengthen our position in\nsecurity and AI with targeted strategic M&A.\nTo summarize, we started the fiscal year with a solid quarter, highlighted by strong order growth,\nmargins and non-GAAP EPS. We remain focused on making strategic investments and\naccelerating innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth\nopportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined expense management. It's this\npowerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation as well as our ability\nto return significant value to shareholders.\nTurning to our financial guidance. For fiscal quarter Q2, our guidance is as follows. We expect\nrevenue to be in the range of $13.75 billion to $13.95 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross\nmargins to be in the range of 68% to 69%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the\nrange of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.89 to\n$0.91.\nFor fiscal year 2025, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $55.3 billion to\n$56.3 billion.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.60 to $3.66. In both our\nQ2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%.\nClosing\nCisco’s next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2025 second quarter results, will be on\nWednesday, February 12, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nThe prepared remarks set forth above and the related conference call may be deemed to contain\nforward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Organization and Basis of Presentation\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2025\nand fiscal 2024 are each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three\ngeographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\nWe have prepared the accompanying financial data as of October 26, 2024 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, without audit, pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to\nsuch rules and regulations. The July 27, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures\nrequired by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information\npresented not misleading. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes\nthereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024.\nIn the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the consolidated balance sheet as of October 26, 2024, the results of\noperations, the statements of comprehensive income, the statements of cash flows and the statements of equity for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, as\napplicable, have been made. The results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal\nyear or any future periods.\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests\nattributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not\nmaterial for any of the fiscal periods presented. The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period’s presentation. We have evaluated subsequent\nevents through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n(a) Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nSegment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that expands the disclosure\nrequirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures around significant segment expenses. The accounting standard update will be\neffective for our fiscal 2025 Form 10-K on a retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting\nstandard update on our segment disclosures.\nImprovements on Income Tax Disclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update expanding the requirements for disclosure of\ndisaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The accounting standard update will be effective for our fiscal 2026\nForm 10-K. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our income tax disclosures.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses In November 2024, the FASB issued an accounting standard update expanding the disclosure requirements\nabout specific expense categories, primarily through disaggregated information on income statement line items. The accounting standard update will be\neffective for our fiscal 2028 Form 10-K, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n3. Revenue\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct\nbased on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our\ncommitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware,\nperpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which\ninclude software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record\nrevenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements\nas subscription offers. Revenue from subscription offers includes revenue recognized over time as well as upfront.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally\nupon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the\ncustomer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our\nhardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software\nlicenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software\nmaintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for\nthe customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with\nrevenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and\nhandling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nAn allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future sales returns as of October 26,\n2024 and July 27, 2024 was $42 million and $37 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or\nservices based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their\ndetermination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other\nobservable inputs.\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and\ndetermining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable\nconsideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors,\nchannel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the\nexpected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers’\nright of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nWe assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can download throughout the\ncontract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish over a relatively short time period. These updates or\nupgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software licenses and are required to maintain the security license’s utility as the\nrisks and threats in the environment are rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single\nperformance obligation satisfied over the contract term.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(a) Disaggregation of Revenue\nWe disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows for our various\nofferings. The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in\ndifferent economic risk profiles for each category. The following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nProduct revenue:\nNetworking $ 6,753 $ 8,822\nSecurity 2,017 1,010\nCollaboration 1,085 1,117\nObservability 258 190\nTotal Product 10,114 11,139\nServices 3,727 3,529\nTotal $ 13,841 $ 14,668\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nNetworking consists of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and servers. These technologies consist of both hardware and\nsoftware offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where\nrevenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized\nupfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this\ncategory have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\nSecurity consists of our Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and\nResponse offerings. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term\nsoftware licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our\ncustomers’ network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance\nobligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations\nwhere revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied\nover time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\nCollaboration consists of our Webex Suite, Collaboration Devices, Contact Center and Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) offerings. These\nproducts consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this\ncategory are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance\nobligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the\ncontract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over\nthe contract term.\nObservability consists of our network assurance, monitoring and analytics and observability suite offerings. These products consist primarily of software\nofferings, including software licenses and SaaS. Our perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized\nupfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of\ncontrol with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct\nperformance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and\nadvanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time\nwith revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue\nrecognized as services are delivered.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is\nreceived based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for our hardware, software and\nservice offerings. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.\nSubscription revenue includes revenue recognized from our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements. Our\nsubscription revenue is recorded in product and services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, 2024 October 28, 2023\nProduct $ 4,419 $ 3,207\nServices 3,425 3,254\nTotal $ 7,844 $ 6,461\nThe majority of our product subscription revenue is recognized over time and the remainder is recognized upfront. Substantially all of our services subscription\nrevenue is recognized over time based on the contract term.\n(b) Contract Balances\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net was $4.5 billion as of October 26, 2024 compared to $6.7 billion as of July 27, 2024, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe allowances for credit loss for our accounts receivable are summarized as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, 2024 October 28, 2023\nAllowance for credit loss at beginning of period $ 87 $ 85\nProvisions (benefits) — 2\nRecoveries (write-offs), net (9) (5)\nAllowance for credit loss at end of period $ 78 $ 82\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nGross contract assets by our internal risk ratings are summarized as follows (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024\n1 to 4 $ 1,244 $ 1,266\n5 to 6 1,599 1,456\n7 and Higher 71 72\nTotal $ 2,914 $ 2,794\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts\nare primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. Our contract assets for these\nunbilled receivables, net of allowances, were $2.9 billion as of October 26, 2024 and $2.7 billion as of July 27, 2024, and were included in other current assets\nand other assets.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was $27.5 billion as of October 26, 2024 compared to $28.5 billion as of July 27, 2024. We\nrecognized approximately $5.3 billion of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 27, 2024.\n(c) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\nWe capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be\nrecognized in future periods.

These costs are initially deferred and typically\namortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to\n11\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nthe period of benefit. Capitalized contract acquisition costs were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively, and were\nincluded in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs was $208 million and $158 million for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively, and was included in sales and marketing expenses.\n4.

The total\ncash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $13 million. Total transaction costs related to acquisition activities were $9\nmillion and $31 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred in general and\nadministrative expenses (“G&A”) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe purchase price allocation for acquisitions completed during recent periods is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about fair value\nof assets and liabilities becomes available. Additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but is currently unknown to us may become known\nduring the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.\nThe goodwill generated from these acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is primarily related to expected synergies. The goodwill is\ngenerally not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each acquisition from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations and the\nrevenue and net income subsequent to the acquisition date for the acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 have not been presented because\nthe effects of the acquisitions were not material to our financial results.\nCompensation Expense Related to Acquisitions\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with Cisco of certain\nemployees of the acquired entities.\nThe following table summarizes the compensation expense related to acquisitions (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, 2024 October 28, 2023\nCompensation expense related to acquisitions $ 297 $ 49\nAs of October 26, 2024, we estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to $1.3 billion may be required to be recognized pursuant to applicable\nacquisition agreements.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n5.

Restructuring and Other Charges\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2025 Plan”), in order to allow us to invest in key growth opportunities and\ndrive more efficiencies in our business, of which approximately 7% of our global workforce would be impacted with estimated pre-tax charges of up to\n$1 billion. In connection with the Fiscal 2025 Plan, we incurred charges of $665 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. These aggregate pre-tax charges are\nprimarily cash-based and consist of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. We expect the Fiscal 2025 Plan to be substantially\ncompleted by the end of fiscal 2025.\nIn fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2024 Plan”), in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas.\nWe completed the Fiscal 2024 Plan and incurred cumulative charges of $654 million.

These adjustments were not material for the first quarter of 2024. We held equity interests in certain private equity\nfunds of $0.8 billion as of each of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, which are accounted for under the NAV practical expedient.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held\ncompanies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest entity models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our\ninvestments in these privately held companies and our customer financings, and have determined that as of October 26, 2024, there were no additional\nsignificant variable interest or voting interest entities required to be consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.8 billion as of each of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024. Of the total carrying\nvalue of our investments in privately held companies as of October 26, 2024, $0.8 billion of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities\nwhich are not required to be consolidated. As of October 26, 2024, we have total funding commitments of $0.3 billion related to privately held investments.\nThe carrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments, collectively, represent our maximum exposure related to privately held\ninvestments.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n11.

Level 2 available-for-sale debt investments are\npriced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as\nactual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors,\nor other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input to make our assessments and\ndeterminations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio and have not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such\ninputs. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as\nthey are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2\nfair value measurements during the periods presented.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(b) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative are adjusted to fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are made when\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer occur, or due to impairment. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable\ninputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\n(c) Other Fair Value Disclosures\nThe fair value of our short-term loan receivables approximates their carrying value due to their short duration. The aggregate carrying value of our long-term\nloan receivables as of each of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024 was $2.7 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term loan receivables approximates\ntheir carrying value. We use unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables, and\ntherefore they are categorized as Level 3.\nAs of October 26, 2024, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities. As of October 26, 2024, the\nfair value of our senior notes was $20.6 billion with a carrying amount of $20.1 billion. This compares to a fair value of $20.4 billion and a carrying amount of\n$20.1 billion as of July 27, 2024. The fair value of the senior notes was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was\ncategorized as Level 2.\n12.

For additional information, see Note 13.\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a\nmake-whole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that have been issued pursuant to our short-term debt financing program,\nas discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of October 26, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nAs of October 26, 2024, future principal payments for long-term debt, including the current portion, are summarized as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Amount\n2025 (remaining nine months) $ 500\n2026 1,751\n2027 3,502\n2028 —\n2029 2,500\nThereafter 12,000\nTotal $ 20,253\n26\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(c) Credit Facility\nOn February 2, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated 5-year $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. The interest rate for the credit\nagreement is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we\nmaintain an interest coverage ratio (defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0.\nAs of October 26, 2024, we were in compliance with all associated covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under our credit agreement.\n13. Derivative Instruments\n(a) Summary of Derivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks. Our primary objective in\nholding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such\nrisks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and requiring collateral in certain cases. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one\ncounterparty resulting from credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments and the line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to which they were recorded are summarized as follows (in\nmillions):\nDERIVATIVE ASSETS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES\nOctober 26, July 27, October 26, July 27,\nBalance Sheet Line Item 2024 2024 Balance Sheet Line Item 2024 2024\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nForeign currency derivatives Other current assets $ 45 $ 47 Other current liabilities $ — $ 1\nForeign currency derivatives Other assets 14 15 Other long-term liabilities — —\nInterest rate derivatives Other current assets 2 — Other current liabilities 8 11\nTotal 61 62 8 12\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nForeign currency derivatives Other current assets — 2 Other current liabilities 50 47\nForeign currency derivatives Other assets — — Other long-term liabilities 14 15\nTotal — 2 64 62\nTotal $ 61 $ 64 $ 72 $ 74\nThe following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for our fair value hedges (in millions):\nCUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF FAIR\nVALUE HEDGING ADJUSTMENT\nINCLUDED IN THE CARRYING\nCARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED\nASSETS/(LIABILITIES) ASSETS/LIABILITIES\nOctober 26, July 27, October 26, July 27,\nBalance Sheet Line Item of Hedged Item 2024 2024 2024 2024\nShort-term debt $ (493) $ (488) $ 7 $ 11\n27\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, recognized in interest and other income (loss), net is summarized as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, 2024 October 28, 2023\nInterest rate derivatives:\nHedged items $ (4) $ (9)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments 4 9\nTotal $ — $ —\nThe effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of derivative instruments not designated as hedges is summarized as follows (in millions):\nGAINS (LOSSES) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED\nDerivatives Not Designated as October 26, October 28,\nHedging Instruments Line Item in Statements of Operations 2024 2023\nForeign currency derivatives Other income (loss), net $ (32) $ (130)\nTotal return swaps—deferred compensation Operating expenses and other 22 (77)\nEquity derivatives Other income (loss), net — 2\nTotal $ (10) $ (205)\nThe notional amounts of our outstanding derivatives are summarized as follows (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024\nForeign currency derivatives $ 7,535 $ 7,434\nInterest rate derivatives 950 500\nTotal return swaps—deferred compensation 1,032 985\nTotal $ 9,517 $ 8,919\n(b) Offsetting of Derivative Instruments\nWe present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with\nthe respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the\nsame counterparty.\nTo further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral\nbetween the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral\nprovided for was $7 million and $11 million as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\n(c) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the\nexposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\nWe hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward\ncontracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 24 months. The derivative\ninstrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings\nwhen the hedged exposure affects earnings.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as\nforeign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the\ncontracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\nWe hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our net investment\nin those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.\n(d) Interest Rate Risk\nWe hold an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to a fixed-rate senior note that is due in fiscal 2025. Under the interest rate swap, we\nreceive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on SOFR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of the swap is to convert the\nfixed interest rate of the senior fixed-rate note to a floating interest rate based on SOFR. The gain and loss related to the change in the fair value of the interest\nrate swap is included in interest expense and substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt attributable to the\nchange in market interest rates.\nWe periodically enter into treasury lock agreements, designated as cash flow hedges, in order to hedge the impact of changes in the U.S. benchmark interest\nrate on future interest payments in anticipation of future debt offerings. Changes in the fair value of treasury lock agreements are recorded to AOCI and\nreclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.\n(e) Equity Price Risk\nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not\ndesignated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.\nWe are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees and directors. Although not\ndesignated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation\nexpense.\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\n(a) Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the\nnormal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract\nmanufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A\nsignificant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments.\nCertain of these inventory purchase commitments are directly with suppliers, and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for certain\nproduct components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based\non our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\n29\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024\nLess than 1 year $ 4,309 $ 3,952\n1 to 3 years 886 1,085\n3 to 5 years 126 121\nTotal $ 5,321 $ 5,158\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with\nthe valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, the liability for these purchase commitments was $439 million\nand $498 million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities.\n(b) Other Commitments\nWe have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion as of\nOctober 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\n(c) Product Warranties\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the product warranty liability (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 362 $ 329\nProvisions for warranties issued 105 98\nAdjustments for pre-existing warranties 1 3\nSettlements (111) (100)\nBalance at end of period $ 357 $ 330\nWe accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for technical support staff, and associated\noverhead. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime\nwarranty.\n(d) Financing and Other Guarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners customers.\nPayments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented.\nChannel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term\nfinancing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel\npartners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $6.0 billion and $8.2 billion for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of\nOctober 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nFinancing Guarantee Summary The aggregate amounts of channel partner financing guarantees outstanding at October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024,\nrepresenting the total maximum potential future payments under financing arrangements with third parties along with the related deferred revenue, are\nsummarized in the following table (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024\nMaximum potential future payments $ 123 $ 127\nDeferred revenue (12) (13)\nTotal $ 111 $ 114\n(e) Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have indemnification obligations to other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us,\nwith respect to certain matters. We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time or circumstances within which an indemnification claim can be\nmade and the amount of the claim.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount for claims made under the indemnification obligations due to uncertainties in the litigation\nprocess, coordination with and contributions by other parties and the defendants in these types of cases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in\neach particular case and agreement. Historically, indemnity payments made by us have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar\nindemnification obligations to our agents.\n(f) Legal Proceedings\nBrazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and\nits affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian\ntax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest,\nand penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo\nhave asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003\nthrough 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by\nBrazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $142 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $839 million for interest, and $323\nmillion for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of October 26, 2024.\nWe have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending\nthe claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process\nin Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our\nBrazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.\nCentripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (“Centripetal”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia, alleging that several of our products and services infringe eleven Centripetal U.S. patents. After two bench trials and various\nadministrative actions and appeals, we have been found either to not have infringed any of the patents or the patents have been invalidated. Centripetal has\nappealed one of the invalidity decisions and the non-infringement judgment of the District Court, and both of those proceedings are ongoing.\nBetween April 2020 and February 2022, Centripetal also filed complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany (“German Court”), asserting a total of\nfive patents and one utility model. Centripetal sought damages and injunctive relief in all cases. In various proceedings in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have been\nfound to have not infringed three patents, one patent was invalidated, the utility model was invalidated, and the infringement action on the final patent is stayed\ndue to an invalidity action heard on June 6, 2024 in the Federal Patent Court, in which all claims, aside from one auxiliary claim, were found invalid, for which\nwe are awaiting the entry of judgment from the Federal Patent Court. Centripetal’s appeals of two of the non-infringement findings remain pending and, on\nMarch 27, 2024, the Court of Appeals rejected Centripetal’s appeal of the third non-infringement finding.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nOn July 10, 2023, Centripetal filed a complaint in the Paris Judiciary Court asserting the French counterpart of a European Patent. Centripetal seeks damages\nand injunctive relief in the case. Centripetal previously asserted the German counterpart of the same European Patent in Germany and the German Court\nrejected Centripetal’s complaint finding no infringement. We have filed our response and defenses to the complaint and we anticipate that on December 5,\n2024, the Court will set a schedule for the remainder of the proceedings.\nDue to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the litigations\nat this time. If we do not prevail in these litigations, we believe that any damages ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nRamot On June 12, 2019 and on February 26, 2021, Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (“Ramot”) asserted patent infringement claims against Cisco and Acacia\nin the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) and in the District of Delaware (“D. Del.”), respectively. Ramot is seeking damages,\nincluding enhanced damages, and a royalty on future sales. Ramot alleges that certain optical transceiver modules and line cards infringe three patents. We\nchallenged the validity of the patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and the pending District Court cases have been stayed. On September\n28, 2021 and May 24, 2022, Cisco and Acacia filed two declaratory judgment actions of noninfringement against Ramot in D. Del on other Ramot patents and\nthose proceedings are ongoing. The Court set trial in the D. Del. cases for November 3, 2025.\nWhile we believe that we have strong non-infringement and invalidity arguments in these litigations, and that Ramot’s damages theories in such cases are not\nsupported by prevailing law, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these litigations at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation\nprocesses. If we do not prevail in court in these litigations, we believe any damages ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nEgenera On August 8, 2016, Egenera, Inc. (“Egenera”) asserted infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\nalleging that Cisco’s Unified Computing System Manager infringes three patents. Egenera sought damages, including enhanced damages, and an injunction.\nTwo of the asserted patents were dismissed, leaving Egenera’s infringement claim based on one asserted patent. On March 25, 2022, the PTO preliminarily\nfound all of the asserted claims of the remaining patent unpatentable in ex parte reexamination proceedings. On August 15, 2022, after a jury trial for the\nremaining patent, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Cisco. The District Court denied Egenera’s post-trial motions, and Egenera filed an appeal to the\nFederal Circuit on January 13, 2023. The Federal Circuit heard oral argument on October 11, 2024 and we are awaiting the decision.\nIn addition to the above matters, we are subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including\nintellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that the ultimate costs to resolve these\nmatters will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stockholders’ Equity\n(a) Stock Repurchase Program\nIn September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of October 26, 2024, the remaining authorized amount for stock\nrepurchases under this program was approximately $3.2 billion with no termination date. The stock repurchase activity for fiscal 2025 and 2024 under the stock\nrepurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nWeighted-Average Price\nQuarter Ended Shares per Share Amount\nFiscal 2025\nOctober 26, 2024 40 $ 49.56 $ 2,003\nFiscal 2024\nJuly 27, 2024 43 $ 46.80 $ 2,002\nApril 27, 2024 26 $ 49.22 $ 1,256\nJanuary 27, 2024 25 $ 49.54 $ 1,254\nOctober 28, 2023 23 $ 54.53 $ 1,252\nThere were stock repurchases of $25 million that were pending settlement as of each of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024.\nThe purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of\nthe repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in\ncapital.\n(b) Dividends Declared\nOn November 13, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share to be paid on January 22, 2025, to all stockholders of\nrecord as of the close of business on January 3, 2025. Future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.\n(c) Preferred Stock\nUnder the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series\nand, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix by resolution the designation, powers (including voting powers (if any)), preferences and relative,\nparticipating, optional or other special rights, if any, of such series, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. As of\nOctober 26, 2024, we have not issued any shares of preferred stock.\n16. Employee Benefit Plans\n(a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans\nWe have one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various\ncompanies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement\nthereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with us. The\nnumber and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, our operating results, government regulations, and other factors.\nThe 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the vesting of which may be time-\nbased or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions. Time-based and performance-based RSUs generally vest over three years\nwith certain awards containing retirement eligible provisions. Employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by our Board of\nDirectors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2030 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by our stockholders prior\nto or on such date.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nUnder the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock options and SARs and\n(ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend\nequivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted\nstock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited\nor terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted\nagainst shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of the application of the share ratio described above, will become\navailable again for issuance under the 2005 Plan. As of October 26, 2024, 158 million shares were authorized for future grant under the 2005 Plan.\n(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four\nconsecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair\nmarket value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate\non the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to\nexercised purchase rights. No shares were issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during each of the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024. As of\nOctober 26, 2024, 68 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\n(c) Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense consists of expenses for RSUs and stock purchase rights, granted to employees or assumed from acquisitions. The\nfollowing table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, 2024 October 28, 2023\nCost of sales—product $ 57 $ 42\nCost of sales—services 74 61\nShare-based compensation expense in cost of sales 131 103\nResearch and development 354 274\nSales and marketing 210 186\nGeneral and administrative 115 90\nRestructuring and other charges 17 8\nShare-based compensation expense in operating expenses 696 558\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 827 $ 661\nIncome tax benefit for share-based compensation $ 174 $ 143\nAs of October 26, 2024, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $4.1 billion which is expected to be\nrecognized over approximately 1.7 years on a weighted-average basis.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(d) Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nA summary of the restricted stock and stock unit activity, which includes time-based and performance-based or market-based RSUs, is as follows (in millions,\nexcept per-share amounts):\nWeighted-Average\nRestricted Stock/ Grant Date Fair\nStock Units Value per Share Aggregate Fair Value\nUnvested balance at July 29, 2023 122 $ 44.04\nGranted and assumed 63 48.97\nVested (58) 43.46 $ 2,906\nCanceled/forfeited/other (10) 45.65\nUnvested balance at July 27, 2024 117 $ 46.86\nGranted and assumed 7 50.94\nVested (13) 46.03 $ 586\nCanceled/forfeited/other (2) 46.47\nUnvested balance at October 26, 2024 109 $ 47.24\n17.

We believe it is reasonably possible that\ncertain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer\npricing and various other matters.\nOn August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. The opinion related to the U.S. taxation of deemed\nforeign dividends in the transition year of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal 2018). While we were not a party to the case, the opinion resulted in a change to\nour tax position. As such, we recorded a tax benefit of $720 million as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 due to this\nrecent U.S. Tax Court opinion.\n19. Segment Information and Major Customers\n(a) Revenue and Gross Margin by Segment\nWe conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis consisting of three segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. Our\nmanagement makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from our internal management system. Sales are attributed\nto a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. We do not allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative\nexpenses to our segments in this internal management system because management does not include the information in our measurement of the performance of\nthe operating segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation\nexpense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges to the\ngross margin for each segment because management does not include this information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments.\nSummarized financial information by segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, based on our internal management system and as utilized by our\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nRevenue:\nAmericas $ 8,252 $ 9,022\nEMEA 3,588 3,664\nAPJC 2,001 1,982\nTotal $ 13,841 $ 14,668\nGross margin:\nAmericas $ 5,740 $ 5,968\nEMEA 2,522 2,545\nAPJC 1,328 1,328\nSegment total 9,590 9,841\nUnallocated corporate items (469) (284)\nTotal $ 9,121 $ 9,557\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nRevenue in the United States was $7.4 billion and $8.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(b) Revenue for Groups of Similar Products and Services\nWe design and sell Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking and other products related to the communications and IT industry and provide services associated\nwith these products and their use.\nThe following table presents revenue for groups of similar products and services (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nRevenue:\nNetworking $ 6,753 $ 8,822\nSecurity 2,017 1,010\nCollaboration 1,085 1,117\nObservability 258 190\nTotal Product 10,114 11,139\nServices 3,727 3,529\nTotal $ 13,841 $ 14,668\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\n20.

We believe our customers have largely completed the installation of products from the elevated level of product shipments seen\nduring fiscal 2024. Total revenue decreased by 6% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding Splunk, total revenue decreased 14% compared\nwith the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 6%. In the first quarter of fiscal\n2025, total software revenue was $5.5 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 24%, primarily driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total\nsubscription revenue increased 21%, primarily driven by the contribution of Splunk.\nTotal gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points. Product gross margin increased by 0.6 percentage points, largely driven by benefits from Splunk,\nfavorable product mix and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing erosion. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and\nmarketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 7.4 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased\nby 12.2 percentage points primarily driven by incremental operating expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges of $665 million and higher\namortization of purchased intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Diluted earnings per share decreased 24%, driven by a decrease of 25% in net\nincome, partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 74 million shares.\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $0.8 billion, EMEA revenue decreased by $76 million and APJC revenue\nincreased by $19 million. From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines across all of our customer markets. From a product\ncategory perspective, the product revenue decrease of 9% was driven by a decline in revenue in Networking of 23% and Collaboration of 3%. This decline was\npartially offset by product revenue growth in Security of 100% and Observability of 36%, each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk.\nWhile we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to\ncontinue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. We remain focused on delivering innovation across\nour technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. We believe that we\nare making progress on our strategic priorities.\n39\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nStrategy and Priorities\nAcross the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to transform and drive better outcomes and experiences.

Note 2 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024, as updated as applicable in Note 2 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements herein, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the\namounts reported based on these policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct\nbased on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our\ncommitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware,\nperpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software\nlicenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of\ngoods sold on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally\nupon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the\ncustomer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our\nhardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software\nlicenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software\nmaintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for\nthe customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with\nrevenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and\nhandling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or\nservices based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their\ndetermination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other\nobservable inputs.\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and\ndetermining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable\nconsideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors,\nchannel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the\nexpected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers’\nright of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate\nsignificantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as\nthe difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for\ninventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and\nsubsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of\nour future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur provision for inventory was $207 million and $133 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The provision (benefit) from the\nliability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was a benefit of $6 million and a provision of $43 million for the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, if there were a higher incidence\nof inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, or if supply constraints were to continue, we could be required to\nincrease our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability,\ncould be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. For\nfurther discussion around the supply chain impacts and risks, see “—Results of Operations—Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks” and “—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain.”\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well\nas our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such\naccruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark,\nand other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our\ngrowth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim\nmade against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable\nterms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill\nrepresents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred\nplus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We\nperform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The\nassessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in\naccordance with the guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or\notherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nand 2024.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe accounting for acquisitions requires significant estimates and judgments in the valuation of purchased intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the\nvaluation of purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, useful lives and discount rates.\nWhile our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and\nwould not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an\nimpairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the\nfuture undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as\nthe difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of\nour purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of\n42\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nfactors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nOur ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to\nthe tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit\nsettlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was a benefit of 19.6% and a tax provision of 18.1% in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are\nreasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an\nestimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that\nare considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation\nallowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nIf we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact\nto the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower\ntax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to\nforeign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization\nand amortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer\npricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to\nintercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including\nchanges to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income\ntaxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United\nStates, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating\nadditional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once\nadopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital\ninvestment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely\nimpact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our\nprovision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating\nresults and financial condition.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue\nThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and services (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28, Variance Variance\n2024 2023 in Dollars in Percent\nRevenue:\nProduct $ 10,114 $ 11,139 $ (1,025) (9)%\nPercentage of revenue 73.1 % 75.9 %\nServices 3,727 3,529 198 6 %\nPercentage of revenue 26.9 % 24.1 %\nTotal $ 13,841 $ 14,668 $ (827) (6)%\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.\nExcluding Splunk, total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 14% as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments.

Revenue from the Networking\nproduct category decreased by 23%, or $2.1 billion. Revenue declined across the portfolio as a result of product shipments returning to normalized levels\nduring the quarter from the elevated levels of product shipments we experienced in prior quarters. Revenue declined in both campus switching and data center\nswitching, primarily driven by declines in our Catalyst 9000 series and Nexus 9000 series offerings. We experienced a revenue decline in enterprise routing,\nalthough we saw revenue growth in our SD-WAN offerings. The decrease in wireless was primarily driven by our WiFi-6 offerings. We also saw a revenue\ndecline in internet infrastructure.\nSecurity\nThe Security product category consists of our Network Security, Identity and Access Management, SASE and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response\nofferings. Revenue in our Security product category increased by 100%, or $1.0 billion, primarily driven by Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response\nofferings, which includes the offerings from Splunk, growth in our Network Security and SASE offerings. Excluding Splunk, product revenue in the Security\nproduct category increased 2%.\nCollaboration\nThe Collaboration product category consists of our Webex Suite, Collaboration Devices, Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. Revenue in our Collaboration\nproduct category decreased by 3%, or $32 million, primarily driven by declines in our On-Prem Webex Suite and Collaboration Devices offerings, partially\noffset by growth in our Contact Center and CPaaS offerings.\nObservability\nThe Observability product category consists of our network assurance, monitoring and analytics and observability suite offerings. Revenue in our Observability\nproduct category increased 36%, or $68 million, driven by our Observability Suite and growth in our Network Assurance offerings. Excluding Splunk, product\nrevenue in the Observability product category increased 1%.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nServices Revenue by Segment\nThe following table presents the breakdown of services revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28, Variance Variance\n2024 2023 in Dollars in Percent\nServices revenue:\nAmericas $ 2,249 $ 2,171 $ 78 4 %\nPercentage of service revenue 60.3 % 61.5 %\nEMEA 903 824 79 10 %\nPercentage of service revenue 24.2 % 23.3 %\nAPJC 575 534 41 8 %\nPercentage of service revenue 15.5 % 15.2 %\nTotal $ 3,727 $ 3,529 $ 198 6 %\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.\nServices revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by Splunk and revenue growth\nin our software support offerings, solution support offerings, and advisory services.

These supply constraints resulted\nin the need to secure long-term supply and increased inventory supply chain balances compared to historical levels. This in turn has significantly increased our\nsupply chain exposure, which has resulted in negative impacts to our product gross margin in recent periods and may result in further negative impacts in future\nperiods. This exposure includes potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we\nare unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures.\nServices Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended October 26, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2023\nOur services gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher headcount-related\ncosts, unfavorable mix of service offerings and to a lesser extent, higher delivery costs.\nOur services gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic\ninvestments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross\nmargin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.\nGross Margin by Segment\nThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nAMOUNT PERCENTAGE\nOctober 26, October 28, October 26, October 28,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross margin:\nAmericas $ 5,740 $ 5,968 69.6 % 66.2 %\nEMEA 2,522 2,545 70.3 % 69.5 %\nAPJC 1,328 1,328 66.4 % 67.0 %\nSegment total 9,590 9,841 69.3 % 67.1 %\nUnallocated corporate items (1) (469) (284)\nTotal $ 9,121 $ 9,557 65.9 % 65.2 %\n(1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant\nlitigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges.

If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular\nmarket in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or\nacquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to incremental expenses from Splunk, higher headcount-related expenses, higher cash compensation\nfrom acquisitions and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by lower contracted services spending.\nG&A Expenses\nG&A expenses increased due to incremental expenses from Splunk, higher headcount-related expenses and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by\nlower contracted services spending.\nEffect of Foreign Currency\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by\napproximately $8 million, or 0.2%, compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets:\nCost of sales $ 325 $ 186\nOperating expenses 265 67\nTotal $ 590 $ 253\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was primarily due to amortization of purchased intangibles from\nour recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of Splunk. The increase was partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets that became fully\namortized.\n49\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan in order to allow us to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in\nour business. This restructuring plan is expected to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $1\nbillion. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $665 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect this plan to be substantially\ncompleted by the end of fiscal 2025.\nWe expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from this restructuring plan in our key growth opportunities. As a result, the overall cost savings from\nthis restructuring plan is not expected to be material for future periods.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nOperating income $ 2,358 $ 4,276\nOperating income as a percentage of revenue 17.0 % 29.2 %\nThree Months Ended October 26, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2023\nOperating income decreased by 45%, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 12.2 percentage points. These changes were primarily\nfrom a revenue decrease, incremental expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets,\npartially offset by a gross margin percentage increase (driven by favorable product mix and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing erosion).\nInterest and Other Income (Loss), Net\nInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28, Variance\n2024 2023 in Dollars\nInterest income $ 286 $ 360 $ (74)\nInterest expense (418) (111) (307)\nInterest income (expense), net $ (132) $ 249 $ (381)\nThree Months Ended October 26, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2023\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the decrease in interest income was driven by a lower average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. The\nincrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the issuances of senior notes and commercial paper.\nOther Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28, Variance\n2024 2023 in Dollars\nGains (losses) on investments, net:\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments $ (25) $ (20) $ (5)\nMarketable equity investments 24 (46) 70\nPrivately held investments 74 (5) 79\nNet gains (losses) on investments 73 (71) 144\nOther gains (losses), net (32) (12) (20)\nOther income (loss), net $ 41 $ (83) $ 124\n50\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nThree Months Ended October 26, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2023\nThe change in our other income (loss), net was primarily driven by net gains on our privately held investments and marketable equity investments and\nunfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended October 26, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2023\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of (19.6)% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with an effective tax rate\nof 18.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a $720 million benefit related to a U.S. Tax Court\nopinion issued during the quarter regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal 2018).\n51\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends,\nour contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024 Increase (Decrease)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 9,065 $ 7,508 $ 1,557\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments 9,194 9,865 (671)\nMarketable equity securities 412 481 (69)\nTotal $ 18,671 $ 17,854 $ 817\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by net cash provided by operating\nactivities of $3.7 billion and net issuances of commercial paper of $1.0 billion. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to stockholders in\nthe form of cash dividends of $1.6 billion and repurchases of common stock of $2.0 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.2 billion and\ncapital expenditures of $0.2 billion.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and\ntheir availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-\nsale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and\ninvestments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing\nactivities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.\nSecurities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are\naccounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least\n102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured\nlending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses.\nWe did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024,\nwe had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our\nstockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net\ncash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nOctober 26, October 28,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 3,661 $ 2,371\nAcquisition of property and equipment (217) (134)\nFree cash flow $ 3,444 $ 2,237\nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating\nresults, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and\nfinancing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional\ndiscussion, see “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated\npercentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it\nreflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our\ncommon stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the\nfree cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including\nrepaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in\naccordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.\nThe following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nDIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nWeighted-Average Price\nQuarter Ended Per Share Amount Shares per Share Amount TOTAL\nFiscal 2025\nOctober 26, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 1,592 40 $ 49.56 $ 2,003 $ 3,595\nFiscal 2024\nJuly 27, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 1,606 43 $ 46.80 $ 2,002 $ 3,608\nApril 27, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 1,615 26 $ 49.22 $ 1,256 $ 2,871\nJanuary 27, 2024 $ 0.39 $ 1,583 25 $ 49.54 $ 1,254 $ 2,837\nOctober 28, 2023 $ 0.39 $ 1,580 23 $ 54.53 $ 1,252 $ 2,832\nOn November 13, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share to be paid on January 22, 2025, to all stockholders of\nrecord as of the close of business on January 3, 2025. Future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.\nThe remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $3.2 billion, with no termination date.\nAccounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024 Increase (Decrease)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 4,457 $ 6,685 $ (2,228)\nOur accounts receivable net, as of October 26, 2024 decreased by approximately 33%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2024, primarily due to timing and\namount of product and service billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nInventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in\nmillions):\nOctober 26, July 27, July 29, Variance vs. July 27, Variance vs. July 29,\n2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInventories $ 3,143 $ 3,373 $ 3,644 $ (230) $ (501)\nInventory purchase commitments $ 5,321 $ 5,158 $ 7,253 $ 163 $ (1,932)\nInventory deposits and prepayments $ 935 $ 973 $ 1,109 $ (38) $ (174)\nThe following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27, July 29, Variance vs. Variance vs.\n2024 2024 2023 July 27, 2024 July 29, 2023\nLess than 1 year $ 4,309 $ 3,952 $ 5,270 $ 357 $ (961)\n1 to 3 years 886 1,085 1,783 (199) (897)\n3 to 5 years 126 121 200 5 (74)\nTotal $ 5,321 $ 5,158 $ 7,253 $ 163 $ (1,932)\nInventory as of October 26, 2024 decreased by 7% and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 3% from our\nbalances at the end of fiscal 2024. The combined decrease of 1% in our inventory and inventory purchase commitments as compared with the end of fiscal\n2024 was primarily due to our continued efforts to work with contract manufacturers and suppliers to optimize our inventory and purchase commitment levels.\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the\nnormal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract\nmanufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our\nrequirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity.\nOur inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing\ncapacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are entered into directly with suppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and\npricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are\nfirm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our\nrequirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times\nwith the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our\ninventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024 Increase (Decrease)\nLoan receivables, net $ 5,534 $ 5,808 $ (274)\nLease receivables, net 1,000 906 94\nTotal, net $ 6,534 $ 6,714 $ (180)\nFinancing Receivables Our financing arrangements include loans and leases. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware,\nsoftware and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network\ninstallation and integration of our products and services. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized\nby a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables decreased by 3% as compared with the end of fiscal 2024.\nFinancing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under\nfinancing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some\ncases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and\n54\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nloan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms\ngenerally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables\nare derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard\npayment terms.\nThe volume of channel partner financing was $6.0 billion and $8.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. These financing\narrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance\nof the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively. We could be\ncalled upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements\nhave been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with\nrevenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the\nguarantee is removed. As of October 26, 2024, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $123 million, of\nwhich approximately $12 million was recorded as deferred revenue.\nBorrowings\nSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\nMaturity Date 2024 2024\nSenior notes:\nFixed-rate notes:\n3.50% June 15, 2025 $ 500 $ 500\n4.90% February 26, 2026 1,000 1,000\n2.95% February 28, 2026 750 750\n2.50% September 20, 2026 1,500 1,500\n4.80% February 26, 2027 2,000 2,000\n4.85% February 26, 2029 2,500 2,500\n4.95% February 26, 2031 2,500 2,500\n5.05% February 26, 2034 2,500 2,500\n5.90% February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000\n5.50% January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000\n5.30% February 26, 2054 2,000 2,000\n5.35% February 26, 2064 1,000 1,000\nTotal $ 20,250 $ 20,250\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.\nWe were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 26, 2024.\nCommercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $15.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We\nuse the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $11.9 billion and $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes\noutstanding as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\nCredit Facility On February 2, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated 5-year $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. The interest rate for\nthe credit agreement is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants,\nincluding that we maintain an interest coverage ratio (defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense) of not\nless than 3.0 to 1.0. As of October 26, 2024, we were in compliance with all associated covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under our credit\nagreement.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRemaining Performance Obligations The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024 Increase (Decrease)\nProduct $ 19,882 $ 20,055 $ (173)\nServices 20,108 20,993 (885)\nTotal $ 39,990 $ 41,048 $ (1,058)\nShort-term RPO $ 20,310 $ 20,882 $ (572)\nLong-term RPO 19,680 20,166 (486)\nTotal $ 39,990 $ 41,048 $ (1,058)\nTotal remaining performance obligations as of October 26, 2024 decreased 3% compared to the end of fiscal 2024. Remaining performance obligations for\nproduct decreased by 1% compared to the end of fiscal 2024. Remaining performance obligations for services decreased by 4%. We expect approximately 51%\nof total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\nDeferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions):\nOctober 26, July 27,\n2024 2024 Increase (Decrease)\nProduct $ 12,941 $ 13,219 $ (278)\nServices 14,561 15,256 (695)\nTotal $ 27,502 $ 28,475 $ (973)\nReported as:\nCurrent $ 15,615 $ 16,249 $ (634)\nNoncurrent 11,887 12,226 (339)\nTotal $ 27,502 $ 28,475 $ (973)\nTotal deferred revenue decreased 3% compared to the end of fiscal 2024. The decrease in deferred product revenue of 2% was primarily due to lower business\nvolume. The decrease in deferred services revenue of 5% was driven by lower business volume and ongoing amortization of deferred services revenue.\nContractual Obligations\nTransition Tax Payable\nThe income tax payable outstanding as of October 26, 2024 for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries was $3.4 billion.\nApproximately $1.8 billion is payable in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and $1.6 billion is payable in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.\nFor our Contractual Obligations see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nOther Commitments\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees\nof the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion as\nof October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered\nto be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of\nOctober 26, 2024 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be\nregarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make\nadditional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon\nto make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under\n“Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to\naccess capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically,\nincluding the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock\nrepurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings,\nand other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or\nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.\n57\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding\navailable-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp\nrise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in\ninterest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. Our\navailable-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of October 26, 2024.\nWe monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit\nquality of our portfolio is strong.\nFinancing Receivables Our financing receivables had a carrying value of $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024. As of\nOctober 26, 2024, a hypothetical 50 basis points (“BPS”) increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables\nby a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively.\nDebt As of October 26, 2024, we had $20.3 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was\n$20.1 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $20.6 billion. As of October 26, 2024, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market\ninterest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $0.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.7\nbillion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.\nAt any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could cause us to incur additional interest expense to the extent we issue additional commercial paper or other\ndebt.\nEquity Price Risk\nMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We hold equity securities for strategic\npurposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. The total fair value of our marketable\nequity securities was $412 million and $481 million as of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024, respectively.\nPrivately Held Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total carrying amount of our privately held\ninvestments was $1.8 billion as of each of October 26, 2024 and July 27, 2024. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or\ndevelopment stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically\nin the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held investments is based on\nthe fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of the respective period-ends are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions):\nOctober 26, 2024 July 27, 2024\nNotional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value\nForward contracts:\nPurchased $ 3,829 $ (64) $ 3,586 $ (59)\nSold $ 3,706 $ 59 $ 3,848 $ 60\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue\nis primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect\non our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite\neffect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in\naddition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.\n58\nTable of Contents\nApproximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging,\nincreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $8 million, or 0.2%, compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTo reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge\ncertain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign\ncurrency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance\nof exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign\nexchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.\nWe also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables\nthat are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and\npayables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option\ncontracts for speculative purposes.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our first quarter of fiscal 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor a description of our pending legal proceedings, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies—(f) Legal Proceedings” in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our\nactual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The descriptions below include any\nmaterial changes to and supersede the description of the risk factors affecting our business previously disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur operations can be difficult to predict because our operating results may fluctuate in future periods.\nOur operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which\nmay contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:\n• Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses, in part due to changes in\nthe global economic environment\n• Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue\n• Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments\n• Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and\ndifferent business models from various geographic regions\n• The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers\n• The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging\ntechnologies, as well as the adoption of new standards\n• Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales\n• The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers\n• Manufacturing and customer lead times\n• Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations\n• The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially\nduring a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems\n• Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of\ncertain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements\n• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant\nrestructuring charges\n• Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions\n• Benefits anticipated from our investments\n• Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to\nbe expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could materially harm our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nChallenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute,\nto slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced\ndemand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service provider and cloud as well as\nenterprise and other customer markets; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers\ndisposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and\nhigher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\nThe global macroeconomic environment can be challenging and inconsistent. In certain prior periods, we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global\nmacroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our\n60\nTable of Contents\nmarkets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the\ngeopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, and China-Taiwan\nrelations), the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may\ncontinue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, were to deteriorate,\nwe may experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to\nparticular customer markets within that segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’\nperception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are\ncritical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence\ngathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have a negative\nimpact on our operating results.\nOur revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, which can be exacerbated during periods\nwhen the global macroenvironment is challenging and inconsistent and can result in market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past\nperiods, or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could\nalso be negatively impacted if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024,\nwe experienced a decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to\nimplement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. We have also experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded\nnet bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue\nfor a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in\nwhich overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing\nissues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are\noperating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be negatively impacted if such matters occur and are not remediated within\nthe same quarter.\nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant impact on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large\norders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to\npredict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary\nmaterially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Longer than normal manufacturing lead times\nin the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and\nto cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such\nmultiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our efforts to improve\nmanufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing\ncomponent supply-related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer\nexpectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to\nshorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future\nperiods if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or\nwe are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to predict or may\npersist longer than anticipated. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term\ncommitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able\nto quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could materially harm our operations and financial\nresults. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers, see “Results of Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks”, “Liquidity and Capital\nResources—Inventory Supply Chain” and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nTable of Contents\nSupply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or\nmanufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating\nresults, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could negatively impact our gross\nmargins.\nThe fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse\nimpact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results. Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers,\nreservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component\nsupplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.\nA reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health emergencies, geopolitical tensions\n(including as a result of China-Taiwan relations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of\none or more components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure\nto appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially harm\nour business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or\npurchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the\nevent that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross\nmargins could decrease. In addition, vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or\ndemand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when\nsignificant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our\noperations, including longer than normal lead times. For example, in recent periods, there was a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply\nwhich affected lead times, the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Additionally, we may in the future experience a\nshortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity\nproblems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand\nfor those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and\ncomponent demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive\ncomponents, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products.\nDuring periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter\nshortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build\nnew products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be\ndeveloped.\nAlthough in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or\nlimited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of\nthese sources, especially during times when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be\nable to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it\ndifficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains\nor relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in\nother markets.\nManufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers\nand use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to improve\nmanufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that\neither allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances,\nthese agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When\nfacing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn\ncontributes to an increase in inventory and purchase\n62\nTable of Contents\ncommitments. In past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component\nshortages. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and obsolete inventory\ncharges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly and product demand\nsignificantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to continue\nto mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than\nanticipated. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers, see “Results of Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks”, “Liquidity and Capital\nResources—Inventory Supply Chain” and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.\nAlthough our product gross margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and in other recent periods, our level of product gross margins have declined in\ncertain prior periods, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:\n• Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of hardware and software\n• Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models (including continuing to increase\nthe use of business models where revenue is recognized over multiple periods)\n• Our ability to reduce production costs\n• Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or\ninternal development\n• Sales discounts\n• Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply\nchain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those that have\nimpacted the market for components, including semiconductors and memory in past periods, and which costs have in the past and may continue to\nbe exacerbated by inflation\n• Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges\n• Changes in shipment volume\n• The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals\n• Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to\nchanges in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or\nif the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates\n• Lower than expected benefits from value engineering\n• Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China\n• Changes in distribution channels\n• Increased warranty or royalty costs\n• Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions\n• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans\nChanges in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well\nas the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals, the addition of personnel and other related costs, and other resources to support\nhigher levels of service business in future periods.\nSales to the service provider and cloud market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nSales to the service provider and cloud market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of\ncertain other Networking and Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider and cloud product orders significantly decreased\nduring fiscal 2024 and we have experienced similar declines in certain prior periods. Product orders from the service provider and cloud market could continue\nto decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Products in the\nservice provider and cloud market could also face a high degree of customer concentration, with bespoke product designs and features that would be difficult to\nsell to alternate customers should the primary customer reduce its product orders with Cisco.\n63\nTable of Contents\nSales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which\nservice provider and cloud customers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this\nindustry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn,\nor periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns\nmay continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services\nwithin their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider and cloud customers have been negatively impacted by slowdowns in\nthe general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider and cloud market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital\navailability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have negatively impacted our business\nand operating results in the past, and could materially harm our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider and cloud\ncustomers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger\nshare of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can\nadd further risk to business conducted with service providers.\nDisruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\nIf we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross\nmargins could be negatively impacted. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold\nthrough direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and\nservice providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in\naddition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are\nalso systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers. We refer to\nsales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in\nforecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.\nHistorically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. There can be no assurance that\nchanges in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. Some factors could\nresult in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our\nchannel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or\notherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear;\nsome of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions; and\nrevenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to\ncomply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to do so, that could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial\ncondition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.\nThe markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could negatively impact our achievement of revenue growth.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions\nthat offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The\noverall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we\nincrease our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined\nnetworking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we have faced increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on\ncommoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition,\nthe growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new\ncompetition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and\nwe anticipate this will continue.\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively\nlow, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have\ngreater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our\nexisting competitors but\n64\nTable of Contents\nalso from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face\ncompetition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas,\nand this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies,\nincluding computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable\nand general purpose microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and\nvirtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some\nof our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position\nthem to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the\ndevelopment and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners.\nCompanies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business\nwith us.\nWe also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of\nnetworking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage\nthese complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial\ncondition and accordingly affect our chances of success.\nIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and we may experience increased\ncompetition or delays in product development.\nWe have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and\nservices. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of\nindustry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures. If successful, these\nrelationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in\nsome business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also,\nif these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational\ndifficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.\nInventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\nWe must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. Our\ndistributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new\nproducts. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in\nresponse to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory,\nreceive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we\nbalance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing\ntechnology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to\nmeet customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in\nturn could result in lower gross margins.\nOur financial performance may be negatively impacted by demand for, and costs to deliver, our software subscription offerings; and interruptions or\nperformance problems associated with these offerings, including interruptions or performance problems caused by third-party providers on which we rely,\nmay negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIn recent years, we have shifted our business model to deliver more recurring software and subscription offerings. This shift in our business model was\naccelerated by recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of Splunk in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Market acceptance of our software subscription\nofferings, which includes our as-a-service solutions, can be affected by a variety of factors, including: security, reliability, performance, terms of service,\nsupport terms, customer preference, community engagement, concerns regarding data privacy or data protection, and the enactment of laws or regulations in\njurisdictions in which we operate. To generate sales growth for our software subscription offerings, we need to convince potential customers to purchase new\nlicenses or subscriptions and generate timely renewals and additional purchases from existing customers. Any failure to do so could result in decreased\nrevenue, reduced sales, increased churn or otherwise negatively impact our results of\n65\nTable of Contents\noperations and financial condition. Further, growth of our software subscription offerings depends, in part, on the ability of customers to use and access these\nsolutions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in service, storage failures, and other performance-related problems due to a\nvariety of factors, such as infrastructure and software changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints, unauthorized access, denial of service or other\ncyber attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to timely identify the cause or causes of these performance problems and, even if timely identified, we\nmay be unable to timely remediate the underlying cause. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance for our software\nsubscription offerings, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. Performance-related issues\nof our software subscription offerings may result in increased operational costs, delays in new feature rollouts, customer loss, reputational damage, and legal or\nregulatory liability, including liability under customer contracts or for losses suffered by our customers.\nTo deliver our software subscription offerings, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to implement and maintain this business. We make\nsignificant investments to increase or maintain capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our infrastructure and operations, including those\nprovided by third-party providers on which we rely. We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not\neffectively scale our operations to meet the needs of our customers and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, we may not\nbe able to grow this business as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions, and we may be unable to compete as\neffectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, if our costs associated with our software subscription offerings were to\nsignificantly increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. We are also subject to the risk of performance-\nrelated problems or interruption of the services provided by third-party providers on which we rely, which could cause revenues for software subscription\nofferings to decline, damage to our reputation, legal liability exposure, and/or increased expenses, all of which could negatively impact our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond\nto emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service\nintroductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products\nand services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our\nofferings our business could be harmed.\nThe process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions—\nsuch as artificial intelligence, security, observability, and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and\nemerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our\nstrategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept.\nIn particular, if our model of the evolution of networking, security, or observability does not emerge as we believe it will, or these industries do not evolve as\nwe believe they will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited\nvalue. For example, if we do not introduce products related to these markets in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed\nare based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail\nto develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately\nsucceed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be negatively impacted in periods\nsurrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also\nbeen seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume\nthem. As a part of these efforts, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our\nbusiness models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or\nthe changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles\nthat we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic\nalliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology\ndelivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new\nproduct and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and\nservices from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and\n66\nTable of Contents\nservices. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to\nmarket in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not\nrender our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority areas\nmay not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.\nChanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset\nimpairments and workforce reductions or restructurings.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of,\nor otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the\nrecording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation\nof excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate\nrecoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in\ncertain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders\nbeing placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our\nestimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform\ngoodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to\nearnings. From time to time we initiate restructuring plans. Our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of such plans. Our\nrestructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could materially harm our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition.\nOver the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority areas, and these investments may achieve\ndelayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our\nengineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. We also\nintend to focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than\nsome of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the\nbenefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these\nbenefits is delayed, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to\ncontinue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and\npersonnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n• Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies,\nparticularly with companies that have large and widespread operations and/or complex products (such as Splunk)\n• Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread\noperations resulting from acquisitions\n• Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles\n• Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market\npositions\n• Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners\n• Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions\n• The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and\ncontinuing after announcement of acquisition plans\n67\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions have in the past and may in the future also cause us to:\n• Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership\n• Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt\n• Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition\n• Assume liabilities\n• Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges\n• Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets\n• Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure\n• Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses\n• Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given\nthat our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage\nand successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes,\nfrom successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed\nproducts, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all\npossible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by\nmergers and acquisitions. Risks described with respect to new product development also apply to acquisitions.\nEntrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations.\nAs we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity, we compete with companies of all sizes. Several of our\ncompetitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers complete infrastructure\ndeployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand\nfor these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support,\nand financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks,\nparticularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling\ncapabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs or\nother quality or reliability problems that can unexpectedly interfere with its intended operations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software\nis installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual\nproducts or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins.\nFrom time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had\nshipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product\ndefect or bug could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory\ncosts, product reengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.\nDue to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results\nand financial condition.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into\nemerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Our business in\nemerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in\nour business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be negatively\nimpacted by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could materially\nharm our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from\n68\nTable of Contents\nglobal central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters,\naffect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to procure\ncomponents if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent\nglobal macroeconomic environment; foreign currency exchange rates; geopolitical tensions (including China-Taiwan relations); political or social unrest;\neconomic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global economic\nramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; environmental protection regulations (including new laws and regulations related to climate change); trade\nprotection measures, such as tariffs; other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our\nproducts from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service provider and\ngovernment spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\nadverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.\nIssues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or\notherwise materially harm of our business.\nWe currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business operations. Our research and development of such\ntechnology remains ongoing. AI presents risks and challenges and may result in unintended consequences that could affect its further development or our and\nour customers’ adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and\nrapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Leveraging AI capabilities to\npotentially improve our internal functions and operations also presents further risks, costs, and challenges. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and\nattempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. The\nAI-related legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the\nevolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. AI-related\nissues, deficiencies and/or failures could also give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in\njurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other\nlaws; damage our reputation; or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in\nsome markets outside the United States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of\nleasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing\nadditional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our\nfinancing activities may increase if our customers are negatively impacted by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no\nassurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among\ncustomers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur\neconomic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future\nlosses, if incurred, could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets\nmakes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could materially\nharm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our\nearnings.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity\ninvestments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our\ninvestments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are\nsubject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under\ndevelopment are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the\nmarket risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About\nMarket Risk.”\n69\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange\nrates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our\ncustomers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating\nexpenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as\nbusiness practices evolve, and they could materially harm our financial results and cash flows.\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel.\nCompetition for such personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California and other major United States locations. Stock incentive\nplans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive\nperformance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting\nfrom the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also negatively impact our ability to retain key employees. As\na result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional\ngeopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or\ndelays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales fields, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective\nproduct introductions. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have\nengaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims in the future.\nAdverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Any litigation can be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover,\nthe results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could materially harm our\nbusiness, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted and damage to our reputation may occur due to the production and sale of counterfeit versions of our\nproducts.\nAs is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While\nwe work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect\ncounterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and\nrestitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise\npurchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could\nnegatively impact our operating results.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could negatively impact our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be negatively impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower\ntax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to\nforeign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and\namortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing\nadjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany\nrealignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the\ntaxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant\njudgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has\nmade changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes\nto numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries,\nwill not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and\n70\nTable of Contents\ncommitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision\nfor income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There\ncan be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global\nclimate change).\nOur corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region\nknown for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our\ncustomers, suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding or other weather-related\nactivity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of supply chain components and delivery of products. In addition, global\nclimate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level\nrise, changing precipitation, and flooding. We have not to date experienced a material event as a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the\noccurrence of any such event in the future could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTerrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as\nthe on-going Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war), and other events (such as economic sanctions, trade restrictions and reactions of the governments,\nmarkets and the general public, including the sanctions and restrictions related to the on-going Russia-Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the\neconomies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have\nsimilar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment\nof our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be negatively impacted by our incurrence of debt.\nAs of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $20.3 billion that mature at\nspecific dates from calendar year 2025 through 2064. We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured\ncommercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $15.0 billion, and we had $11.9 billion in\ncommercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of October 26, 2024. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt,\nincluding any additional debt to refinance maturing debt, will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources.\nFurther, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not negatively impact our operating results or\nfinancial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity\nsecurities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both\nin the United States and internationally. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters,\ndiversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, in our annual Purpose Report, on our website, in our filings with the\nSEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments involve risks and uncertainties and could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. For\nexample, in September 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which\nrelies, in large part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our products, the adoption of renewable energy\nat customer and supplier sites, and the adoption of certain of our products and services by our customers. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to\nachieve, our 2040 net zero goal or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of\nthese initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we\ncould be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals,\nor commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n71\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.\nWe generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products.\nAlthough we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or\nother proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore,\nmany key aspects of networking technology are governed by industry-wide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In\naddition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any\nactions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not\ndependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our\nproprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a\ncompetitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to\nbe successful.\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark,\nand other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our\ngrowth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents\nin the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to\ndetermine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated\nlitigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our\nexisting or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and\ndiversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are\nmade by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on\nacceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly\nagainst us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even\narguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is\nsuccessful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license\nthe proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed. For\nadditional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Our\nexposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the\ndevelopment process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third parties have made\ninfringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or\nrenew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at\nall. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding\nthese matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other\nintellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\n72\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory Requirements\nCyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and\nfinancial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our\ncustomers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in third-party products we use, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or\nregulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access on a regular basis to (i) our products and services (together, our “solutions”) and\n(ii) the servers, data centers, networks, systems, and cloud-based services operated or enabled by us, or by third parties upon which we rely, on or through\nwhich our and third-party data are stored, processed, or can be accessed (collectively, our “IT environment”). We anticipate continuing to be increasingly\nsubject to such attempts as cyber attacks become more sophisticated and difficult to predict and protect against. Despite our active implementation of security\nand other measures, our solutions and IT environment have been, and continue to be, vulnerable to cyber attacks, incidents, data breaches, malware, inadvertent\nerror, disruptions, failures, physical security breaches, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees, contingent workers, and malicious actors.\nAdditionally, nation-state actors or their agents have in the past successfully attacked our IT environment and have also exploited vulnerabilities in our\nsolutions to carry out attacks, and we anticipate that these attacks and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in our solutions will continue and may intensify during\nperiods of diplomatic or armed conflict. Further, a cyber attack or other incident could go undetected and persist in our environments for extended periods.\nCyber-related events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, the disruption of access to, or the operation of our solutions and IT\nenvironment or those of our customers or third-party providers upon which we rely, or result in confidential information stored on our systems or our\ncustomers’ or other third-party systems being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed now (or in the future), or be lost or stolen. Efforts to limit the ability of\nmalicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. Breaches of\nsecurity in our IT environment, our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in third-party products we use, regardless of whether the breach is\nattributable to a vulnerability in our solutions, a failure by us to timely mitigate or apply a security fix for products we use that are found vulnerable, or a failure\nto maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity of our solutions and IT environment, could, in each case, result in claims\nof legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. The occurrence of a cyber attack, data breach or\nother incident could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or\nregulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise negatively impact our business, any of which could materially harm our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition.\nVulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers\nto remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade our solutions could\nresult in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.\nThe products and services (together, our “solutions”) we sell to customers, and the cloud-based services operated or enabled by us, or by third parties upon\nwhich we rely, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or security defects (despite our efforts to prevent and detect them through secure development lifecycle\npractices, testing, and other means), which have not been remedied or cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We also make prioritization\ndecisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Even when we prioritize a vulnerability or security defect,\nin certain instances it has taken, and in the future could take, time for us to develop a remedy and the remedy may ultimately be insufficient to fully fix the\nissue. In addition, workarounds or other mitigation efforts in certain instances have not been, and in the future may not be, available or sufficient to protect\ncustomers prior to a security update being made available. Vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security updates if we have not identified and\naddressed the root cause of a particular vulnerability, if customers have not installed the most recent updates, if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before\na security update is applied to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems, or if a previously patched vulnerability is inadvertently\nreintroduced due to a security regression during future development. Additionally, customers may also need to test security updates before they can be\ndeployed which can delay implementation. When customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, use solutions that are end of life and no longer\nreceive security updates, decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our solutions containing the security update, or configure our solutions in insecure\nways, they are left vulnerable. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and third-party data is stored or\nprocessed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us vulnerable. Failure to comply with\ninternal security policies and standards, including secure development lifecycle practices, failure to prevent or promptly mitigate vulnerabilities and security\ndefects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or\ncustomers not deploying security updates in a timely manner, deciding not to upgrade solutions, or configuring our\n73\nTable of Contents\nsolutions in insecure ways could, in each case, result in claims of legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm\nour business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our\nreputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nGlobal privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult\nand costly. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including\nregulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’ ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services. The interpretation and\napplication of these laws in some instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European\nUnion’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and\nservices offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data for both ourselves and our customers.\nAdditionally, we are subject to California’s Consumer Privacy Act, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act, and other laws, regulations, and obligations\naround the world that govern the handling of personal data. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations\nrelating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to claims of liability to our customers,\ndata subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation, or could otherwise\nnegatively impact our business, any of which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our\nproducts and services.\nChanges in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could materially\naffect the sales and use of our products and services. In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export and import control requirements have impacted\nand may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications\nregulations could impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated\nofferings. Government and other customers’ procurement policies, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or other obligations often give rise to\nevolving privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, data governance, or other requirements; the failure or delay in meeting and maintaining compliance with\nsuch requirements could negatively impact our business, including by limiting our ability to sell products and services, directly or indirectly, to public sector,\ncritical infrastructure, and other customers. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and services include laws, regulations, or\ncustomer procurement requirements related to encryption technology, data, artificial intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, environmental\nsustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, product accessibility, country of origin, and national security controls applicable\nto our offerings and supply chain. Changes in regulatory requirements or our actual or perceived failure to comply (or to enable our customers to comply when\nusing our offerings) with applicable laws, regulations, or other obligations could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nHistorically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the\npublished expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community\nabout our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our\nstock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology\ncompanies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and\npolitical conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such\ntransactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially harm the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility,\nlack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may negatively impact\nour ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.\n74\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.
