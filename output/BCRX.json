(Nasdaq: BCRX) today announced that the Health Services Executive (HSE) in Ireland has recommended ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in eligible patients 12 years and older. With this recommendation, HAE patients in Ireland will have access to the first oral, once-daily therapy for the reduction of recurrent HAE attacks.\n\n“The positive HSE recommendation of ORLADEYO broadens access to modern prophylaxis, providing greater choice for prescribing physicians and potentially a better quality of life for HAE patients in Ireland,” said Charlie Gayer, chief commercial officer of BioCryst.\n\nThe HSE decision in Ireland follows the European Commission marketing authorization of ORLADEYO in April 2021. To date, ORLADEYO is licensed in 44 countries.\n\n**About ORLADEYO****®****(berotralstat)** ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) is the first and only oral therapy designed specifically to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. One capsule of ORLADEYO per day works to prevent HAE attacks by decreasing the activity of plasma kallikrein.\n\n**U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information**\n\n**INDICATION** ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.\n\n**Limitations of use** The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO for the treatment of acute HAE attacks have not been established. ORLADEYO should not be used for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. Additional doses or dosages of ORLADEYO higher than 150 mg once daily are not recommended due to the potential for QT prolongation.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION** An increase in QT prolongation was observed at dosages higher than the recommended 150 mg once-daily dosage and was concentration dependent.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10% and higher than placebo) in patients receiving ORLADEYO were abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nA reduced dosage of 110 mg taken orally once daily with food is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n\nBerotralstat is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein. P-gp inducers (eg, rifampin, St. John’s wort) may decrease berotralstat plasma concentration, leading to reduced efficacy of ORLADEYO. The use of P-gp inducers is not recommended with ORLADEYO.\n\nORLADEYO at a dose of 150 mg is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. For concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended. ORLADEYO at a dose of 300 mg is a P-gp inhibitor. Appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended for P-gp substrates (eg, digoxin) when coadministering with ORLADEYO.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO in pediatric patients <12 years of age have not been established.\n\nThere are insufficient data available to inform drug-related risks with ORLADEYO use in pregnancy. There are no data on the presence of berotralstat in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant, or its effects on milk production.\n\n**To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-833-633-2279 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or**[**www.fda.gov/medwatch/**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wm1Er8GR62Wwooc6zAnwzu6-T8O6eZiGkXFi9MgwkJtFkhbPu5j3rkaJytIIgAwlsgyely3CcLy4B-GOD239POZZCaLqo--zx5tlM9KBNZg=)\n\n**Please see full**[**Prescribing Information**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ADe_A7GvP-UfacNGNZ0xnj-Cs6OwCttt7_zHoDnn3vil7ETGSvS4lc107cWYfHQnOKw9X1gBoZKejpA4FW2GAEdR75Yj3uw62TXv5qz0aVK56Ei4B_N39XnAHADscLvYxR7VOd7L6iriLRu1gK44bT4fqLpcFioZqKn_rtZVw_yzpxBAtsR0Nez3J35PjvCl848iAUIPMKdiS7jZcpWsktlVWdGZ6hiQDLeIBmx0dbzW6EaLmh1mER2kUT2HXaj5jNGc_aazuhs-tck360Oy_8qMaUkmkKwzQ2QfajSJITKtoYu7SPI4nRN44YDC5o4exbiTDQrqzRbN1scXnNbwh4ck6yb-gSSIoo5Gll1Clymv4--yKD6_ysD4Zk4eAS0zkz46DCF2l4xdE8yqvH4jj0vhGzEqrcxaSMjaig9uelzDGCepP1XGudWUSXJbJfsbhDvboc8w5KImWo-8qMopj6fan0UuPavkDMAqR6DU309LOkqvDj8Ezs3ZORFexY7dbAfbZbkwffw3iZ8Qpc7K1blgWF_hYtzo_Oz2UJlI2iTJ0HkyrMuRR70CEjZq7gdPKS2STxLKvhmY9bqmYP3jsSYkRmjWgxGY_dGY1Zr8bKU=)**.**\n\n**The Irish Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for ORLADEYO (berotralstat) can be found through**[**medicines.ie.**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1pLbSORe_1LUDwAGiwWsrpVAzLm2dAfluXxfORP010XYeuP0HWlHOPyiWDi5XPrZFeDu5nUpPBbV6EsKAP555kJI-RLAA9E2ZLu5n8TiIbDIc2k_euHPqaXMNsoTrMtMZiqSBR7cYHK4Vd9L9ppiwMJ8B9PjacwwAcvTrId1nKY=)\n\n**Anyone can report suspected side effects to the HPRA.

As we look ahead, we see robust and durable revenue growth, new opportunities for younger children to benefit from ORLADEYO, and data readouts from BCX17725 in Netherton syndrome and avoralstat in DME, all while moving closer to sustainable profitability,” said Jon Stonehouse, president and chief executive officer of BioCryst.\n\n**Program Updates**\n\n**_ORLADEYO_**** _®_**** _(berotralstat): Oral, Once-daily Treatment for Prevention of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Attacks_**\n\n“The real-world efficacy and convenience patients and physicians are experiencing with ORLADEYO are driving accelerated commercial momentum that translates to nearly 36 percent revenue growth in our fourth year on the market. Based on this established sales trajectory, and the continued, durable strength of patient demand we see for ORLADEYO, we are more confident than ever of achieving peak sales of $1 billion for ORLADEYO,” said Charlie Gayer, chief commercial officer of BioCryst.\n\n  * ORLADEYO net revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $116.3 million (+35.7 percent year-over-year (y-o-y)).\n  * Start forms in the U.S. are up 14.2 percent over the past 12 months compared to the prior 12 months; and 67 new U.S. prescribers were added during the third quarter, one of the highest totals over the most recent eight quarters.\n  * The reimbursed product rate in the U.S. increased 0.4 percent in the third quarter to 74.8 percent. \n  * Sales from outside the U.S. contributed 11.4 percent of global ORLADEYO net revenues in the third quarter.\n  * Since launch, approximately half of patients who have started ORLADEYO have switched from another prophylactic therapy. The company has begun the observational Phase 4 APeX-T study, designed to generate real-world data to inform physicians on the best individual approaches to support transition to ORLADEYO.\n\n\n\n**_Rare Disease Pipeline_**\n\n“The goal with our pipeline is to build on our success with ORLADEYO by bringing the next highly differentiated product to patients living with rare disease. We are making excellent progress, with BCX17725 now in the clinic, avoralstat nearing the clinic and initial patient data from both programs expected next year. These programs would address significant unmet needs for patients with Netherton syndrome and DME, respectively,” said Dr. Helen Thackray, chief research and development officer at BioCryst.\n\n  * The company has advanced BCX17725, its KLK5 inhibitor for the treatment of Netherton syndrome, into clinical trials and expects initial data from the program in 2025. \n    * Netherton syndrome is a serious, rare, lifelong genetic disorder affecting the skin, hair, and immune system, caused by lack of normal function of a natural inhibitor of KLK5. People with Netherton syndrome often have red, scaly, inflamed skin, fragile hair, and are more likely to develop skin infections, allergies, asthma and eczema. Netherton syndrome can be life threatening, especially during infancy when patients are vulnerable to dehydration and recurrent infections. Currently, there are no approved treatments for Netherton syndrome.\n  * In 2025, the company plans to advance avoralstat, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, into a clinical trial of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). \n    * DME is an important cause of vision loss in diabetes and is due to leakage from the blood vessels in the retina. While current treatments focus on VEGF inhibition, DME can develop from other mechanisms, such as the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway. This is supported by observations that many DME patients have an incomplete response to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies that are administered every four to eight weeks. Avoralstat targets the kallikrein-bradykinin system on the retinal vascular endothelial cells and may result in less vascular leakage and less edema. Avoralstat, delivered to the suprachoroidal space as a depot formulation, is designed to provide high dose levels to the retinal vessels with long-lasting exposure, which could result in less frequent injections and a reduced burden on patients and the healthcare system.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n“It is exciting to see continued ORLADEYO growth alongside the significant progress advancing our pipeline, and another quarter of operating profit. BioCryst is in the strongest financial position in its history,” said Anthony Doyle, chief financial officer at BioCryst.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $117.1 million, compared to $86.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 (+35.1 percent y-o-y). The increase was primarily due to $116.3 million in ORLADEYO net revenue in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $85.7 million in ORLADEYO net revenue in the third quarter of 2023 (+35.7 percent y-o-y). Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $41.1 million from $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 (-12.4 percent y-o-y), primarily due to decreased investment following the discontinuation of the BCX10013 program, partially offset by investments to advance our early clinical and discovery programs and an increased investment in the APeX-P program in preparation for regulatory filings next year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $65.1 million, compared to $50.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 (+28.7 percent y-o-y). The increase was primarily due to increased commercial investment to support our growing revenue, newly launched regions and expanded international operations. There was also an increase in general and administrative expenses to support commercial growth.\n\nInterest expense was $24.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $27.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 (-9.2 percent y-o-y). The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of interest associated with our royalty financing obligations. Due to the strong cash position of the company, we declined to elect the payment-in-kind (PIK) option related to the Pharmakon term loan for the third quarter of 2024, resulting in a cash interest payment of $10.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The PIK option has now expired. Additionally, the company chose not to execute its option, which expired September 30, 2024, to draw the additional $150 million of debt available to it from Pharmakon.\n\nGAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.7 million, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $11.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense, was $24.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $36.1 million, or $0.19 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments totaled $351.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $399.2 million at September 30, 2023. Operating cash increased by $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Financial****Outlook for 2024**\n\nBased on the strength of patient demand for ORLADEYO seen in the third quarter, and expected continued strength in the fourth quarter, the company is adjusting its outlook for full year 2024 global net ORLADEYO revenue to be between $430 million and $435 million (top end of prior range) and introducing full-year 2024 total revenue guidance of between $443 and $448 million based on additional 2024 RAPIVAB revenue.\n\nDirectly related to the revenue strength for both ORLADEYO and RAPIVAB, the company is revising its guidance for operating expenses, and now expects full year 2024 operating expenses to be between $380 million and $390 million. The increase is driven primarily by increased COGS related to new RAPIVAB sales, increased variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution costs related to the continued strong revenue performance for ORLADEYO and increased expenses that are seasonally booked in Q4 related to our support for the HAE community, including charitable donations. This operating expense outlook does not reflect non-cash stock compensation expense, or one-time expenses related to the previously announced workforce reduction implemented in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nBased on the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation, and the strong performance of ORLADEYO, the company is confident that it will achieve a full-year operating profit in 2024 (not including non-cash stock compensation), be approaching quarterly positive earnings per share (EPS) and positive cash flow in the second half of 2025 (not including non-cash stock compensation) and be profitable on an EPS basis, with positive cash flow, for full year 2026. The company expects it can achieve these financial milestones without raising additional funds.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nBioCryst management will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.

These non-GAAP measures also correspond with the way we expected Wall Street analysts to compare our results. Our non-GAAP measures should be considered only as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or in isolation from, our other measures of financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as GAAP revenue, operating income, net income, and earnings per share.\n\nOur references to our first nine months 2023 “non-GAAP” financial measures of adjusted net loss and adjusted earnings per share constitute non-GAAP financial measures. They refer to our GAAP results, adjusted to show the results without the one-time loss on the extinguishment of the Athyrium term loans. Our references to our first nine months 2024 “non-GAAP” financial measures of adjusted net loss and adjusted earnings per share constitute non-GAAP financial measures. They refer to our GAAP results, adjusted to show the results without the one-time R&D restructuring expense. Our reference to our third quarter 2023 and 2024 and first nine months 2023 and 2024 “non-GAAP” financial measure of non-GAAP operating profit constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure. It refers to our GAAP results, adjusted to show the results without including non-cash stock compensation expense.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future results, performance or achievements.
