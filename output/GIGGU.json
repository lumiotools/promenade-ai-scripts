Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share of the Company at a price of $11.50 per share.

Holders of public units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the public units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants.\n\nThe public units were initially offered by the Company in an underwritten offering, and Craft Capital Management LLC acted as a joint book-running manager with EF Hutton LLC in the offering.\n\nA final prospectus relating to and describing the final terms of the offering has been filed with the SEC.
