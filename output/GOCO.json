The proactive work we have done to drive consumer centricity has been instrumental in our ability to navigate the ever-evolving regulatory landscape. Our model is aligned with CMS’s intentions to protect consumers, and the work we have done has prepared us well for the current regulations and those likely to come,” said Vijay Kotte, CEO of GoHealth. “Looking ahead, we remain committed to leveraging our insights and technology to further improve the healthcare journey for consumers, ensuring they have the support they need to make informed decisions.\"\n\n\"While we realize that rewarding agents for doing the right thing may not maximize revenue in the short term, we stand by our belief that PlanFit is an investment in the consumer that will pay off long-term,” said Jason Schulz, CFO of GoHealth. “This alignment of improved financial outcomes with our consumer-first philosophy supports our strategic direction. We remain committed to leveraging technology for better healthcare decisions, as we are poised to drive both sustained profitability and positive consumer impact in the years to come.\n\n_(1)__Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

For many of these consumers, enrolling in a health insurance plan is confusing and difficult, and seemingly small differences between health plans may lead to significant out-of-pocket costs or lack of access to critical providers and medicines. GoHealth’s proprietary technology platform leverages modern machine-learning algorithms, powered by over two decades of insurance purchasing behavior, to reimagine the process of matching a health plan to a consumer’s specific needs. Its unbiased, technology-driven marketplace coupled with highly skilled licensed agents has facilitated the enrollment of millions of consumers in Medicare plans since GoHealth’s inception.

These forward-looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding our expected growth, future capital expenditures and debt service obligations, are forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “aims,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “likely,” “future” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the sections titled “Summary Risk Factors,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”) and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The factors described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this press release, as well as the cautionary statements and other risk factors set forth in the forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nYou should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators**\n\nIn this press release we use supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA; Cash Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Sales per Submission; Cost per Submission and Adjusted Gross Margin per Submission. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate the business and monitor the results of operations. Cash Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to assess Adjusted EBITDA excluding the effect of LTV estimates period over period. Sales per Submission, Cost per Submission and Adjusted Gross Margin per Submission are key operating metrics used by management to understand the Company’s underlying financial performance and trends.\n\nAdditional non-GAAP financial measures, including net revenues excluding the Lookback Adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA excluding the Lookback Adjustments, net revenues excluding both the Non-Encompass BPO Services revenue and the Lookback Adjustments and Adjusted EBITDA excluding both the Non-Encompass BPO Services gross margin and the Lookback Adjustments, are also included in this presentation. The Lookback Adjustments are revenue adjustments that represent changes in estimates relating to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and relate to fiscal years 2021 and prior.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents, as applicable for the period, EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues. Cash Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA plus a decrease or less an increase in the period over period change in our net contract assets. Sales per Submission represents Medicare Revenue per Submission as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. Cost per Submission represents Operating Expense per Submission as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. Adjusted Gross Margin represents Sales per Submission less Cost per Submission.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Adjusted EBITDA, Sales per Submission, Cost per Submission and Adjusted Gross Margin per Submission to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, are presented in the tables furnished below in this press release. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and may include other expenses, costs and non-routine items.\n\n**Key Terms and Performance Indicators; Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThroughout this press release, we use a number of key terms and provide a number of key performance indicators used by management.

(NASDAQ: GOCO) (“GoHealth” or the “Company”), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Second Quarter Highlights_**\n\n  * Second quarter 2024 net revenues of $105.9 million, a $36.9 million decrease compared to $142.8 million in the prior year period.\n  * Second quarter 2024 Submissions of 152,394, a 6% decrease compared to 162,837 Submissions in the prior year period, driven by an increase in Submissions generated by GoHealth’s internal captive agents offset by a decrease in Submissions generated by our external GoPartner Solutions agents.\n  * Second quarter 2024 net loss of $59.3 million, an improvement of $10.9 million compared to a net loss of $70.2 million in the prior year period.\n  * Second quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA(1) of negative $12.3 million, a decrease of $13.1 million compared to positive $0.8 million in the prior year period.\n  * Second quarter 2024 trailing twelve months (“TTM”) positive cash flow from operations was $53.8 million, a decrease of $32.1 million compared to TTM positive cash flow from operations of $85.9 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n“We experienced a decline in net revenues to $105.9 million due to a 6% decrease in total Submissions. Submissions generated by our internal captive agents increased year-over-year, offset by a decline in Submissions generated by our external GoPartner Solutions, or GPS, agents,” said Vijay Kotte, CEO of GoHealth. “We are particularly pleased with the performance of our internal captive agents despite unchanged shopping and switching dynamics since last year's annual enrollment period (“AEP”). We anticipated year-over-year declines from Q1 through Q3, but our team has managed these expected dynamics by driving efficiencies. These results highlight the benefits of our proprietary Encompass workflow and PlanFit CheckUp process. GoHealth plays a critical role in helping Medicare eligible consumers navigate plan options every year. As we gear up for AEP in just 67 days, GoHealth is intensifying targeted marketing efforts to better identify and reach consumers in need of PlanFit CheckUp’s.”\n\n“We also remain committed to leveraging our strengths and strategic initiatives to drive future growth,” continued Kotte. “GoHealth continues to advance our technology to ensure a seamless experience for agents and consumers. We believe that our advancements in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation are setting a new industry standard. Our proprietary technology leverages machine and deep learning models atop our sophisticated data platforms, enabling us to deliver more precise, data-driven insights and significantly enhance agent efficiency. We expect these innovations to streamline processes, provide dynamic personalization in our workflows, and improve our overall operational efficiency. By integrating AI and automation into our operations, we intend to not only enhance the consumer experience but also solidify our position as an industry leader in customer acquisition costs, represented by our Direct Cost of Submission.(2) With our consumer orientation and technology enablement, we are looking forward to continuing to support consumers during what we currently believe will be a dynamic AEP,” continued Kotte.\n\n“We expect various factors to influence the second half of the year and we remain confident in our performance expectations for 2024. We anticipate growth in Submission volume, revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA,\" said Katie O’Halloran, Interim CFO of GoHealth. \"We believe our mix of agency versus non-agency agreements will be a key driver of our cash flow from operations performance. With our continued strategic focus and disciplined execution, we are committed to achieving our goals and delivering long-term value.\"\n\n_(1)__Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, please see below._\n\n_(2)__Direct Cost of Submission is a key operating metric. For a definition of Direct Cost of Submission and a description of how it is calculated, please see below._\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its financial results. A live audio webcast of the conference call will be available via GoHealth's Investor Relations website, https://investors.gohealth.com/. A replay of the call will be available via webcast for on-demand listening shortly after the completion of the call.\n\n**About GoHealth, Inc.**\n\nGoHealth is a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company whose purpose is to compassionately ensure consumers’ peace of mind when making healthcare decisions so they can focus on living life. For many of these consumers, enrolling in a health insurance plan is confusing and difficult, and seemingly small differences between health plans may lead to significant out-of-pocket costs or lack of access to critical providers and medicines. GoHealth’s proprietary technology platform leverages modern machine-learning algorithms, powered by over two decades of insurance purchasing behavior, to reimagine the process of matching a health plan to a consumer’s specific needs. Its unbiased, technology-driven marketplace coupled with highly skilled licensed agents has facilitated the enrollment of millions of consumers in Medicare plans since GoHealth’s inception.

These forward-looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding our expected growth, future capital expenditures, debt service obligations and adoption and use of artificial intelligence technologies are forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “aims,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “likely,” “future” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the sections titled “Summary Risk Factors,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”) and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The factors described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this press release, as well as the cautionary statements and other risk factors set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, the forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nYou should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn this press release we use supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate the business and monitor the results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA represents, as applicable for the period, EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables furnished below in this press release. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and may include other expenses, costs and non-routine items.\n\n**Use of Key Performance Indicators**\n\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. Sales per Submission, Direct Cost of Submission, Direct Cost per Submission and Adjusted Direct Operating Margin per Submission, as well as Submissions, are key operating metrics used by management to understand the Company’s underlying financial performance and trends. Sales per Submission represents Medicare Revenue per Submission as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. Direct Cost per Submission represents Operating Expense per Submission as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. Adjusted Direct Operating Margin per Submission represents Sales per Submission less Direct Cost per Submission. Management uses these metrics to measure the performance of the Submissions generated in a reporting period by reviewing and presenting average performance on a per Submission basis over time. Submissions represent completed applications with our licensed agents and transfers by our agents to the health plan partners as further described below.\n\n**Certain Definitions and Key Terms**\n\nAs used in this press release, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n  * _“LTV”_ refers to the Lifetime Value of Commissions, which we define as aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, health plan partner mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints.\n\n\n  * _“Non-Encompass BPO Services”_ refer to programs in which GoHealth-employed agents are dedicated to certain health plans and agencies we partner with outside of the Encompass operating model.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThroughout this press release, we use a number of non-GAAP financial measures. We define these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\n\n  * “ _Adjusted EBITDA_ ” represents, as applicable for the period, EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items summarized below in this press release.\n\n\n  * “ _Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ ” refers to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\n\n  * _“EBITDA”_ represents net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\nThroughout this press release, we provide a number of key performance indicators used by management.

adjustments recorded in the period, but relating to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods, (ii) non-agency revenue, and (iii) partner marketing and other revenue, divided by (y) the number of Submissions for such period.\n\n\n  * _“Submission”_ refers to either (i) a completed application with our licensed agent that is submitted to the health plan partner and subsequently

(NASDAQ: GOCO) (“GoHealth” or the “Company”), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter Highlights_**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net revenues of $118.3 million, a $13.7 million decrease compared to $132.0 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 Submissions were 166,195, a 2.9% increase compared to 161,550 Submissions in the prior year period, with strong contributions from GoHealth’s internal captive agents, partially offset by a decline in Submissions from the external GoPartner Solutions (“GPS”) agents.\n  * Third quarter 2024 net income of $15.4 million, an improvement of $71.6 million compared to a net loss of $56.2 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA(1) of negative $12.1 million, a decrease of $0.6 million compared to negative $11.5 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 trailing twelve months (“TTM”) positive cash flow from operations of $35.1 million, an increase of $38.3 million compared to TTM negative cash flow from operations of $3.2 million in the prior year period.\n  * Refinanced Credit Facility, establishing new five-year term with new lender group.\n  * Completed the strategic acquisition of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. (“e-TeleQuote”), adding approximately $90.5 million in contract assets and $22.5 million in cash (inclusive of the Company’s initial $5.0 million investment), and recording a $77.4 million gain on bargain purchase, reinforcing GoHealth’s aspirations to expand its market leadership and operational capacity.\n  * Achieved an 11.0% improvement in Direct Operating Cost per Submission(2) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period, through advancements in artificial intelligence (“AI”), automation, and marketing efficiencies, along with targeted operational improvements.\n  * Appointed Brendan Shanahan as Chief Financial Officer, who brings over 30 years of healthcare and financial strategy expertise to GoHealth.\n\n\n\n“Our third-quarter results underscore the strength of our ongoing transformation into a Medicare engagement company. We’ve helped over 650,000 consumers navigate Medicare options through tools like PlanFit CheckUp, and with the addition of e-TeleQuote’s 400 agents, we’re prepared to efficiently serve the demand surge we are seeing in this year’s Medicare Annual Enrollment Period (“AEP”). We believe these developments reinforce GoHealth’s leadership in the eBroker space, positioning us for sustained growth and profitability,” said Vijay Kotte, CEO of GoHealth.\n\n“The acquisition of e-TeleQuote not only added $90.5 million in contract assets and $22.5 million in cash (inclusive of our initial $5.0 million investment), but also provided a substantial gain on bargain purchase of $77.4 million, boosting our financial position,” Kotte continued. “This strategic move expanded our agent capacity ahead of a pivotal AEP, which we believe will enable us to capitalize on market demand. As the competitive landscape shifts, GoHealth aims to stand out, ready to support the millions of consumers facing benefit reductions or coverage losses.”\n\n“GoHealth’s third-quarter results reflect disciplined cost management, as we reduced our Direct Operating Cost per Submission(2) by 11.0%, despite broader market challenges. These efficiency gains and a focus on high-quality lead generation underscore our commitment to driving profitable growth, especially as we progress through AEP,” said Brendan Shanahan, CFO of GoHealth. “With over $77 million gained through the e-TeleQuote acquisition, we believe we’re positioned with the liquidity and flexibility needed to drive long-term value, even as we expand our agent base during this critical AEP.”\n\n“This AEP, we’re seeing unprecedented disruption, with over two million consumers losing coverage and more than six million experiencing reduced benefits. We believe GoHealth’s investments in AI-driven technology, an expanded agent network, and our focus on consumer engagement uniquely position us to lead through these market changes, delivering both growth and improved customer experience,” said Kotte.\n\n_(1)_| _Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

The factors described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this press release, as well as the cautionary statements and other risk factors set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, the forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nYou should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThroughout this press release, we use a number of non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We define these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\n\n  * _“Adjusted EBITDA”_ represents, as applicable for the period, EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. \n  *  _“Adjusted EBITDA Margin”_ refers to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues. \n  *  _“EBITDA”_ represents net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n\n\nWe believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate the business and monitor the results of operations, as well as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented in the tables furnished below in this press release. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and may include other expenses, costs and non-routine items.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. The most relevant business and operating metrics are as follows:\n\n  * _“Direct Operating Cost of Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents costs directly attributable to Submissions generated during a particular period and excludes costs that are indirect or fixed. Direct Operating Cost of Submission is comprised of the portion of the respective operating expenses for revenue share, marketing and advertising and consumer care and enrollment that are directly related to the Submissions generated in the particular period. Direct Operating Cost of Submission, most recently referred to as “Direct Cost of Submission,” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Direct Operating Cost per Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents the average performance of Submissions generated during a particular period. Direct Operating Cost per Submission refers to (x) Direct Operating Cost of Submission for a particular period divided by (y) the number of Submissions generated for such period. Direct Operating Cost per Submission, most recently referred to as “Direct Cost per Submission” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission”_ represents (x) the numerator of Sales per Submission, as defined below, divided by (y) Direct Operating Cost of Submission. Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission, most recently referred to as “Sales/Direct Cost of Submission” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Sales per Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents the average performance of Submissions generated during a particular period. Sales per Submission measures revenues only from the Submissions generated in the period and excludes items that are unrelated to such Submissions, including any impact of revenue adjustments recorded in the period, but relating to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Sales per Submission equals (x) the sum of (i) agency revenues, comprised of the expected amount of initial commission revenue and any renewal commissions to be paid from the health plan partners on such placement as long as the policyholder remains with the same insurance product, as well as partner marketing and other revenue and (ii) non-agency revenues, comprised of the enrollment and engagement services for which cash is collected in advance or in close proximity to the point in time revenue is recognized, divided by (y) the number of Submissions generated for such period. \n  *  _“Submission”_ refers to either (i) a completed application with our licensed agent that is submitted to the health plan partner and subsequently approved by the health plan partner during the indicated period, excluding applications through our Non-Encompass BPO Services or (ii) a transfer by our agent to the health plan partner through the Encompass operating model during the indicated period.\n\n\n\nDirect Operating Cost of Submission, Direct Operating Cost per Submission, Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission, Sales per Submission and Submissions are key operating metrics we use to understand our underlying financial performance and trends.\n\n**Certain Definitions and Key Terms**\n\nAs used in this press release, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n  * _“LTV”_ refers to the Lifetime Value of Commissions, which we define as aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, health plan partner mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints. \n  *  _“Non-Encompass BPO Services”_ refer to programs in which GoHealth-employed agents are dedicated to certain health plans and agencies we partner with outside of the Encompass operating model.\n\n\n\nThe following tables set forth

(NASDAQ: GOCO) (“GoHealth” or the “Company”), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter Highlights_**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net revenues of $118.3 million, a $13.7 million decrease compared to $132.0 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 Submissions were 166,195, a 2.9% increase compared to 161,550 Submissions in the prior year period, with strong contributions from GoHealth’s internal captive agents, partially offset by a decline in Submissions from the external GoPartner Solutions (“GPS”) agents.\n  * Third quarter 2024 net income of $15.4 million, an improvement of $71.6 million compared to a net loss of $56.2 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA(1) of negative $12.1 million, a decrease of $0.6 million compared to negative $11.5 million in the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 trailing twelve months (“TTM”) positive cash flow from operations of $35.1 million, an increase of $38.3 million compared to TTM negative cash flow from operations of $3.2 million in the prior year period.\n  * Refinanced Credit Facility, establishing new five-year term with new lender group.\n  * Completed the strategic acquisition of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. (“e-TeleQuote”), adding approximately $90.5 million in contract assets and $22.5 million in cash (inclusive of the Company’s initial $5.0 million investment), and recording a $77.4 million gain on bargain purchase, reinforcing GoHealth’s aspirations to expand its market leadership and operational capacity.\n  * Achieved an 11.0% improvement in Direct Operating Cost per Submission(2) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period, through advancements in artificial intelligence (“AI”), automation, and marketing efficiencies, along with targeted operational improvements.\n  * Appointed Brendan Shanahan as Chief Financial Officer, who brings over 30 years of healthcare and financial strategy expertise to GoHealth.\n\n\n\n“Our third-quarter results underscore the strength of our ongoing transformation into a Medicare engagement company. We’ve helped over 650,000 consumers navigate Medicare options through tools like PlanFit CheckUp, and with the addition of e-TeleQuote’s 400 agents, we’re prepared to efficiently serve the demand surge we are seeing in this year’s Medicare Annual Enrollment Period (“AEP”). We believe these developments reinforce GoHealth’s leadership in the eBroker space, positioning us for sustained growth and profitability,” said Vijay Kotte, CEO of GoHealth.\n\n“The acquisition of e-TeleQuote not only added $90.5 million in contract assets and $22.5 million in cash (inclusive of our initial $5.0 million investment), but also provided a substantial gain on bargain purchase of $77.4 million, boosting our financial position,” Kotte continued. “This strategic move expanded our agent capacity ahead of a pivotal AEP, which we believe will enable us to capitalize on market demand. As the competitive landscape shifts, GoHealth aims to stand out, ready to support the millions of consumers facing benefit reductions or coverage losses.”\n\n“GoHealth’s third-quarter results reflect disciplined cost management, as we reduced our Direct Operating Cost per Submission(2) by 11.0%, despite broader market challenges. These efficiency gains and a focus on high-quality lead generation underscore our commitment to driving profitable growth, especially as we progress through AEP,” said Brendan Shanahan, CFO of GoHealth. “With over $77 million gained through the e-TeleQuote acquisition, we believe we’re positioned with the liquidity and flexibility needed to drive long-term value, even as we expand our agent base during this critical AEP.”\n\n“This AEP, we’re seeing unprecedented disruption, with over two million consumers losing coverage and more than six million experiencing reduced benefits. We believe GoHealth’s investments in AI-driven technology, an expanded agent network, and our focus on consumer engagement uniquely position us to lead through these market changes, delivering both growth and improved customer experience,” said Kotte.\n\n_(1)_| _Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

These forward-looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding our expected growth, future capital expenditures, debt service obligations, adoption and use of artificial intelligence technologies, the impact on our business from the acquisition of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. (“e-TeleQuote”) and our ability to successfully integrate e-TeleQuote’s operations, technologies and employees into our business, are forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “aims,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “likely,” “future” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this press release are only predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the sections titled “Summary Risk Factors,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”) and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The factors described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this press release, as well as the cautionary statements and other risk factors set forth in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, the forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nYou should read this press release and the documents that we reference in this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThroughout this press release, we use a number of non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We define these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\n\n  * _“Adjusted EBITDA”_ represents, as applicable for the period, EBITDA as further adjusted for certain items summarized in the table furnished below in this press release. \n  *  _“Adjusted EBITDA Margin”_ refers to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues. \n  *  _“EBITDA”_ represents net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n\n\nWe believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate the business and monitor the results of operations, as well as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented in the tables furnished below in this press release. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and may include other expenses, costs and non-routine items.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. The most relevant business and operating metrics are as follows:\n\n  * _“Direct Operating Cost of Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents costs directly attributable to Submissions generated during a particular period and excludes costs that are indirect or fixed. Direct Operating Cost of Submission is comprised of the portion of the respective operating expenses for revenue share, marketing and advertising and consumer care and enrollment that are directly related to the Submissions generated in the particular period. Direct Operating Cost of Submission, most recently referred to as “Direct Cost of Submission,” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Direct Operating Cost per Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents the average performance of Submissions generated during a particular period. Direct Operating Cost per Submission refers to (x) Direct Operating Cost of Submission for a particular period divided by (y) the number of Submissions generated for such period. Direct Operating Cost per Submission, most recently referred to as “Direct Cost per Submission” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission”_ represents (x) the numerator of Sales per Submission, as defined below, divided by (y) Direct Operating Cost of Submission. Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission, most recently referred to as “Sales/Direct Cost of Submission” reflects a name change only. \n  *  _“Sales per Submission”_ is an operating metric that represents the average performance of Submissions generated during a particular period. Sales per Submission measures revenues only from the Submissions generated in the period and excludes items that are unrelated to such Submissions, including any impact of revenue adjustments recorded in the period, but relating to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Sales per Submission equals (x) the sum of (i) agency revenues, comprised of the expected amount of initial commission revenue and any renewal commissions to be paid from the health plan partners on such placement as long as the policyholder remains with the same insurance product, as well as partner marketing and other revenue and (ii) non-agency revenues, comprised of the enrollment and engagement services for which cash is collected in advance or in close proximity to the point in time revenue is recognized, divided by (y) the number of Submissions generated for such period. \n  *  _“Submission”_ refers to either (i) a completed application with our licensed agent that is submitted to the health plan partner and subsequently approved by the health plan partner during the indicated period, excluding applications through our Non-Encompass BPO Services or (ii) a transfer by our agent to the health plan partner through the Encompass operating model during the indicated period.\n\n\n\nDirect Operating Cost of Submission, Direct Operating Cost per Submission, Sales/Direct Operating Cost of Submission, Sales per Submission and Submissions are key operating metrics we
