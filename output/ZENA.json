(Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (“ZenaTech”), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, announces that it has signed Blue Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) compliant partner agreements for its supply chain in order to sell its ZenaDrone 1000 AI drone solutions to US Defense branches and to NATO forces. Through its subsidiary ZenaDrone, the Company recently participated in a Taiwan Trade Mission organized by the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) that directly resulted in these partnerships.\n\nZenaTech can now confirm that all ZenaDrone’s electrical components and supply chain will comply with NDAA standards. ZenaDrone previously completed paid trials with both the US Airforce and US Naval Research using its drones for carrying critical cargo — such as blood — in the field.\n\n“Our strategic relationship with the Arizona Commerce Authority has resulted in these important NDAA-compliant partners needed in order to qualify for the Blue UAS list. The next step is to complete the Green UAS list process, then we will be ready for the Blue UAS certification to be able to execute our plans to do more business with military organizations in the US, NATO and beyond,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.\n\nNDAA compliance refers to adhering to the provisions outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act, which is a set of US federal laws passed every year that specify the budget and expenditures for the Department of Defense (DoD) and address growing cybersecurity concerns. For a product to be NDAA compliant, it must not be produced by a set list of Chinese manufacturers. This provision extends to products, chipsets, cameras, displays, and other technology used.\n\nThe Blue UAS program is a stringent government approved supplier list of drone companies that wish to do business with the US DoD. Suppliers must meet strict NDAA cyber security and supply chain sourcing requirements. The Green UAS program is essential, the same as the blue UAS program, only with a more streamlined and faster process and without the specifications on country of origin for manufacturing.\n\nThe ACA is a longstanding ZenaDrone partner and Arizona will be the site for DoD demonstrations. The company plans to host these demonstrations in the Arizona desert near the ZenaDrone offices in Phoenix.\n\n**About ZenaTech**[ZenaTech](https://www.zenatech.com) (Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) is a technology company specializing in AI drone solutions and enterprise SaaS solutions for mission-critical business applications.

(Nasdaq: ZENA) (FSE: 49Q) (“ZenaTech”), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone solutions and enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solutions, announces today that it will pursue a series of acquisitions to launch its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) operations. These acquisitions have the potential to dramatically increase company revenue and will underpin its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) business by integrating ZenaDrone’s drone technology into the target company operations.\n\nThe DaaS business model allows business customers such as farmers, oil and gas companies, environmental firms, or government departments to utilize a complete drone solution for a specific application─ i.e. a crop management, inspection, safety, or compliance application, and purchase it on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than having to buy the entire drone hardware and software solution. This business model provides cost-effective access to the enhanced productivity benefits and AI capabilities offered by drone technology to optimize operations and eliminate manual processes. ZenaDrone’s multifunction AI drones will be offered in the DaaS business model both directly by the company and through its business partners.\n\n“Organic growth and growth by acquisition have always been a cornerstone of our strategy. This series of new acquisitions includes approximately 20 identified company targets with several currently at the negotiation stage. These acquisitions have the potential to add significant revenue and will power the roll-out of our innovative DaaS business globally,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D.\n\nZenaTech has secured financing for this series of acquisitions from current shareholders.
