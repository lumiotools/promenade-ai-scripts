The data were presented at the 2024 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting November 21-24 in Houston, Texas.\n\n“The combination of a high absorbed radiation dose, favorable safety profile, and consistent response data is very encouraging, particularly in a Phase 1 trial,” said Dr. Andrew Brenner, M.D., Ph.D. “Furthermore, the observed median overall survival rate and long tail survivors receiving multiple doses via compassionate use are uncommon in LM patients, driving our commitment to move rapidly into dose expansion and multiple-dose trials.”\n\nThe data were presented in a session titled, “Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda (rhenium nanoliposome,186RNL) for the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases (LM): Summary of the Phase 1 dose escalation study and Phase 2 administered dose selection,” by Andrew Brenner, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Kolitz/Zachry Endowed Chair Neuro-Oncology Research; Co-Leader, Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics Program, University of Texas Health, San Antonio.\n\n**KEY HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**_ReSPECT-LM Single Administration Dose Escalation Trial_**\n\n**Overview:**\n\n  * Twenty patients with LM were treated and evaluable through Cohort 5, receiving a single intrathecal dose of Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda of up to 66.14 mCi of radiation\n  * Primary cancer diagnosis for the 20 patients with LM included breast cancer (n = 9), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 5), and other primary cancers (n = 6)\n\n\n\n**Safety:**\n\n  * The safety profile through Cohort 5 was favorable, with 1 dose-limiting toxicity (thrombocytopenia) observed in Cohort 5\n  * Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that after a single administration, Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda remained in the cerebrospinal fluid space for at least 7 days and achieved average absorbed doses of up to 253 Gy to the cranial subarachnoid space in Cohort 5\n\n\n\n**Response:**\n\n  * The best clinical benefit rate from a single dose of Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda, assessed from baseline to day 112, was measured through complete response, partial response, and stable disease across three key metrics: \n    * Circulating tumor cells: 93% (14/15 patients) responded, including 1 complete response and 1 stable case\n    * MRI imaging: 75% (12/16 patients), with 5 responses and 7 stable cases\n    * Clinical Response: 86% (12/14 patients), with 2 responses and 10 stable cases\n  * Median overall survival for Cohorts 1-4 was 9 months, with 6 out of the 16 patients alive at the time of analysis\n  * Three of the 20 patients received up to 3 doses of Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda under compassionate use IND, all surviving over 400 days, with one exceeding 30 months\n\n\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n  * The first patient in Cohort 6 has been treated using a modified dose of 75 mCi\n  * Cohort 6 is anticipated to conclude in Q1 2025\n  * Planning is underway for a Phase 1b single dose expansion cohort trial using the Cohort 4 dose of 44 mCi, which is expected to fully enroll in 2025\n\n\n\n**_ReSPECT-LM Multiple Administration Dose Interval Compression Trial_**\n\n  * Obtained agreement from FDA to begin the ReSPECT-LM multi-administration trial for patients with LM (IND 153715); enrollment is expected to begin in early 2025 at seven U.S. trial sites\n\n\n  * The trial will be a two-part study aimed at evaluating the safety, dosing intervals, and efficacy of administering multiple doses of Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda to patients with LM\n\n\n\n**About Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)** LM is a rare complication of cancer in which the primary cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. All malignancies originating from solid tumors, primary brain tumors, or hematological malignancies have this LM complication potential with breast cancer as the most common cancer linked to LM, with 3-5% of breast cancer patients developing LM. Additionally, lung cancer, GI cancers and melanoma can also spread to the CSF and result in LM. LM occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is usually terminal with 1-year and 2-year survival of just 7% and 3%, respectively. The incidence of LM is on the rise, partly because cancer patients are living longer and partly because many standard chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells; yet, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for LM patients, who often succumb to this complication within weeks to several months, if untreated.\n\n**About Rhenium (** 186**Re) obisbemeda** Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda is a novel injectable radiotherapy specifically formulated to deliver direct targeted high dose radiation in CNS tumors in a safe, effective, and convenient manner to optimize patient outcomes. Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda has the potential to reduce off target risks and improve outcomes for CNS cancer patients, versus currently approved therapies, with a more targeted and potent radiation dose. Rhenium-186 is an ideal radioisotope for CNS therapeutic applications due to its short half-life, beta energy for destroying cancerous tissue, and gamma energy for real-time imaging. Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda is being evaluated for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma and leptomeningeal metastases in the ReSPECT-GBM and ReSPECT-LM clinical trials. ReSPECT-GBM is supported by an award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and ReSPECT-LM is funded by a three-year $17.6M grant by the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT).\n\n**About Plus Therapeutics** Plus Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for difficult-to-treat cancers of the central nervous system with the potential to enhance clinical outcomes for patients. Combining image-guided local beta radiation and targeted drug delivery approaches, the Company is advancing a pipeline of product candidates with lead programs in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). The Company has built a supply chain through strategic partnerships that enable the development, manufacturing, and future potential commercialization of its products. Plus Therapeutics is led by an experienced and dedicated leadership team and has operations in key cancer clinical development hubs including Austin and San Antonio, Texas.

The data will be presented at the 2024 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting November 21-24 in Houston, Texas. \n\n“Current gold standard CSF cytology lacks the sensitivity needed to reliably diagnose LM in most clinical situations and lacks utility for disease monitoring,” said Marc H. Hedrick, M.D., Plus Therapeutics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “The FORESEE trial shows that CNSide may be a useful tool in accurately identifying all patients with LM, ruling out patients at risk, and enhancing the disease management and monitoring of LM.”\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n  * The FORESEE trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that CNSide influenced treatment decisions in over 90% of cases evaluated, surpassing the predetermined 20% primary endpoint target\n  * CNSide demonstrated enhanced sensitivity in detecting tumor cells (80%) vs. CSF cytology (29%) in patients with LM\n  * CNSide identified actionable mutations in the CSF, such as HER2 amplification, influencing 24% of therapeutic selection decisions\n  * CNSide exhibited high specificity, with no tumor cells detected in patients without LM\n  * CNSide demonstrated improved Negative Predictive Value in ruling out LM (25%) vs. CSF cytology (10%)\n  * CNSide revealed HER2 positivity in LM tumors in 60% of breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary tumors, informing physician treatment strategies\n\n\n\nThe data will be presented on Sunday, November 24, at 10:15 a.m. CST in a session titled, “CSF Tumor Cell (CSF-TC) Detection, Quantification and Biomarker assessment Helps in Clinical Management of Breast Cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Having Leptomeningeal Disease (FORESEE Study, NCT-5414123),” by Priya Kumthekar, M.D., Associate Professor of Neurology and Hematology/Oncology, and Director of Brain Metastases Program at Northwestern, University, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**About CNSide Diagnostic, LLC** CNSide Diagnostics, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plus Therapeutics, Inc. that develops and commercializes proprietary clinical diagnostic laboratory assays, such as CNSid, designed to identify tumor cells that have metastasized to the central nervous system in patients with carcinomas and melanomas. The CNSid Assay Platform enables quantitative analysis and molecular characterization of tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid that inform and improve the clinical management of patients with leptomeningeal metastases. The Company is planning to commercialize CNSide in the U.S. in 2025.\n\n**About CNSide Test** The CNSide Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Assay Platform consists of four laboratory developed tests (LDTs) used for diagnosis, treatment selection, and treatment monitoring of patients with Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM) from carcinomas or melanoma. The CNSide platform facilitates tumor cell detection / enumeration and biomarker identification using cellular assays (immunocytochemistry (ICC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) and molecular assays (next generation sequencing (NGS)). The CNSide CSF tumor cell enumeration LDT is currently being used in the ReSPECT-LM trial as an exploratory endpoint, and is anticipated to become commercially available in 2025.\n\n**About Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)**\n\nLM is a rare complication of cancer in which the primary cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. All malignancies originating from solid tumors, primary brain tumors, or hematological malignancies have this LM complication potential with breast cancer as the most common cancer linked to LM, with 3-5% of breast cancer patients developing LM. Additionally, lung cancer, GI cancers and melanoma can also spread to the CSF and result in LM. LM occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is usually terminal with 1-year and 2-year survival of just 7% and 3%, respectively. The incidence of LM is on the rise, partly because cancer patients are living longer and partly because many standard chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells; yet, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for LM patients, who often succumb to this complication within weeks to several months, if untreated.\n\n**About FORESEE Clinical Trial**\n\nThe FORESEE Study is a multi-center, prospective clinical trial enrolled patients with Breast or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have suspicious or confirmed Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM). Standard of Care methods to diagnose or assess the treatment response of LM (Clinical Evaluation, MRI and Cytology) have limited sensitivity and specificity. This creates challenges for physicians to manage LM or determine the best course of treatment. The goal of the FORESEE Study was to evaluate the performance of CNSide in monitoring the LM's response to treatment and to assess the impact of CNSide on treatment decisions made by physicians.\n\n**About Rhenium (** 186**Re) obisbemeda**\n\nRhenium (186Re) obisbemeda is a novel injectable radiotherapy specifically formulated to deliver direct targeted high dose radiation in CNS tumors in a safe, effective, and convenient manner to optimize patient outcomes. Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda has the potential to reduce off target risks and improve outcomes for CNS cancer patients, versus currently approved therapies, with a more targeted and potent radiation dose.

(Nasdaq: PSTV) (“Plus” or the “Company”), will present data demonstrating the utility of the CNSide CSF Assay Platform in identifying mutations of key biomarkers in the CSF and their implications in treatment selection for LM. The data will be presented at the 2024 Society for NeuroOncology (SNO) Annual Meeting November 21-24 in Houston, Texas. \n\n“The data from CNSide suggests that biomarker mutation profiles in LM are dynamic, offering valuable insights for treatment strategies,” said Marc H. Hedrick, M.D., Plus Therapeutics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “The genetic drift observed in LM suggests an important role for radiotherapeutics such as Rhenium (186Re) Obisbemeda in addressing this challenging disease.”\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n  * CNSide CSF Assay evaluated 258 CSF samples across 66 patients with LM to analyze clinically relevant biomarkers\n  * Fourteen biomarkers were assessed, including 11 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and 3 by immunocytochemistry (ICC); 12 of the 14 biomarkers demonstrated at least one change during treatment\n  * CNSide CSF FISH analysis detected biomarker changes in 88% (58/66) of patients, with newly identified actionable biomarkers in 26 cases\n  * CNSide CSF ICC analysis revealed biomarker changes in 20% (13/66) of patients, with newly identified actionable biomarkers in 7 cases\n\n\n\nThe data will be presented on Friday, November 22, at 7:30 p.m. CST in a session titled, “The Oncogenic Flip in Patients with Leptomeningeal Metastatic Disease (LMD): Longitudinal Detection in Cerebrospinal Fluid Tumor Cells (CSF-TCs) Reveals Implications for Differential Treatment of the LMD Tumor,” by Arushi Tripathy, M.D., from University of Michigan Department of Neurosurgery.\n\n**About CNSide Diagnostic, LLC** CNSide Diagnostics, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plus Therapeutics, Inc. that develops and commercializes proprietary clinical diagnostic laboratory assays, such as CNSide, designed to identify tumor cells that have metastasized to the central nervous system in patients with carcinomas and melanomas. The CNSide Assay Platform enables quantitative analysis and molecular characterization of tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid that inform and improve the clinical management of patients with leptomeningeal metastases. The Company is planning to commercialize CNSide in the U.S. in 2025.\n\n**About CNSide Test** The CNSide Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Assay Platform consists of four laboratory developed tests (LDTs) used for diagnosis, treatment selection, and treatment monitoring of patients with Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM) from carcinomas or melanoma. The CNSide platform facilitates tumor cell detection / enumeration and biomarker identification using cellular assays (immunocytochemistry (ICC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) and molecular assays (next generation sequencing (NGS)). The CNSide CSF tumor cell enumeration LDT is currently being used in the ReSPECT-LM trial as an exploratory endpoint and is currently anticipated to become commercially available in 2025.\n\n**About Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)**\n\nLM is a rare complication of cancer in which the primary cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. All malignancies originating from solid tumors, primary brain tumors, or hematological malignancies have this LM complication potential with breast cancer as the most common cancer linked to LM, with 3-5% of breast cancer patients developing LM. Additionally, lung cancer, GI cancers and melanoma can also spread to the CSF and result in LM. LM occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is usually terminal with 1-year and 2-year survival of just 7% and 3%, respectively. The incidence of LM is on the rise, partly because cancer patients are living longer and partly because many standard chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells, yet there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for LM patients, who often succumb to this complication within weeks to several months, if untreated.\n\n**About Rhenium (** 186**Re) obisbemeda**\n\nRhenium (186Re) obisbemeda is a novel injectable radiotherapy specifically formulated to deliver direct targeted high dose radiation in CNS tumors in a safe, effective, and convenient manner to optimize patient outcomes. Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda has the potential to reduce off target risks and improve outcomes for CNS cancer patients, versus currently approved therapies, with a more targeted and potent radiation dose. Rhenium-186 is an ideal radioisotope for CNS therapeutic applications due to its short half-life, beta energy for destroying cancerous tissue, and gamma energy for real-time imaging. Rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda is being evaluated for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma and leptomeningeal metastases in the ReSPECT-GBM and ReSPECT-LM clinical trials. ReSPECT-GBM is supported by an award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and ReSPECT-LM is funded by a three-year $17.6M grant by the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT).\n\n**About Plus Therapeutics** Plus Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for difficult-to-treat cancers of the central nervous system with the potential to enhance clinical outcomes for patients. Combining image-guided local beta radiation and targeted drug delivery approaches, the Company is advancing a pipeline of product candidates with lead programs in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). The Company has built a supply chain through strategic partnerships that enable the development, manufacturing, and future potential commercialization of its products. Plus Therapeutics is led by an experienced and dedicated leadership team and has operations in key cancer clinical development hubs including Austin and San Antonio, Texas.
