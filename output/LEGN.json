The positive data from our CARTITUDE-4 study further strengthened our competitive position as CARVYKTI is now the first and only cell therapy shown to significantly extend overall survival compared to standard therapies for multiple myeloma patients as early as second line. This underscores the transformational benefits of this therapy and the importance of our efforts to expand patient access,” said Ying Huang, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Legend Biotech. “To this end, we recently initiated commercial production at our Obelisc facility in Ghent, Belgium, which is anticipated to help fulfill demand for CARVYKTI around the world. We look forward to expanding our capacity further while advancing our R&D programs as part of our long-term strategy to strengthen Legend Biotech’s position as a leader in cell therapy innovation.”\n\n**Regulatory Updates**\n\n  * China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved cilta-cel for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory agent.\n  * Swissmedic approved label expansion of CARVYKTI _®_ for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and are refractory to lenalidomide.\n\n\n\n**Key Business Developments**\n\n  * Announced positive three-year follow-up data from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study showing that CARVYKTI® significantly extended overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy, reducing the risk of death by 45 percent versus standard therapies. These findings were presented in a late-breaking oral session at the 2024 International Myeloma Society (IMS) Annual Meeting. Legend Biotech and Janssen Biotech, Inc.* plan to share these results with US and EU regulatory agencies to support potential label updates.\n  * Received approval for and initiated commercial production of CARVYKTI _®_ at the new Obelisc site in Ghent, Belgium, which is expected to help fulfill additional patient demand.\n  * Launched CARVYKTI _®_ in Switzerland in the third quarter, marking the expansion into the fifth country where CARVYKTI _®_ is commercially available.\n  * Announced the establishment of a new, state-of-the-art research and development (R&D) facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2025, to expand Legend Biotech’s existing U.S. R&D footprint and advance its portfolio of next-generation cell therapies.\n\n\n\n* In December 2017, Legend Biotech entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop and commercialize cilta-cel (the “Janssen Agreement”).\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **_License Revenue_** : License revenue was $17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was entirely contributed by the Novartis License Agreement; compared to $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was entirely contributed by the achievement of milestones under the Janssen Agreement.\n\n\n  * **_Collaboration Revenue_** : Collaboration revenue was $142.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $75.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from sales of CARVYKTI® in connection with the Janssen Agreement.\n\n\n  * **_Collaboration Cost of Revenue_** : Collaboration cost of revenue was $52.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $43.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net trade sales of CARVYKTI®. Collaboration Cost of Revenue is determined based on Legend Biotech’s share of the cost of sales in connection with CARVYKTI® sales under the Janssen Agreement.\n\n\n  * **_Cost of License and Other Revenue_** : Cost of license and other revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.0 million and consisted of costs in connection with the Novartis License Agreement. The Company did not incur any cost of license and other revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * **_Other Income and Gains:_** Other income and gains were $16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $35.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease of $19.0 million was primarily driven by the lack of unrealized foreign exchange gains in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $16.1 million of unrealized foreign exchange gains for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * **_Research and Development Expenses_** : Research and development expenses were $95.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $95.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These expenses are primarily due to research and development activities in cilta-cel, including start-up costs for clinical production in Belgium, as well as continued investment in our solid tumor programs.\n\n\n  * **_Administrative Expenses:_** Administrative expenses were $35.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of administrative functions and infrastructure to increase manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n  * **_Selling and Distribution Expenses_** : Selling and distribution expenses were $44.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with commercial activities for cilta-cel, including the expansion of the sales force and second line indication launch.\n\n\n  * **_Other Expenses:_** Other expenses were $61.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was almost entirely driven by approximately $62.8 million of unrealized foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The unrealized foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by intercompany transactions and balances between the US and non-US legal entities related to the research and development activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, there was no unrealized foreign exchange loss.\n\n\n  * **_Net Loss_** : Net loss was $125.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $62.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * **_Cash Position_** : Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits were $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Webcast/Conference Call Details:** Legend Biotech will host its quarterly earnings call and webcast today at 8:00am ET.

The study evaluated lenalidomide-refractory patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and will be featured in an oral presentation on Monday, December 9, 2024, at 5:45 p.m. PT at the 66th Annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in San Diego.\n\n“This year’s ASH data continues to highlight our advances across key clinical areas aimed at helping healthcare professionals decide the optimal treatment regimens for their patients with multiple myeloma,” said Ying Huang, Ph. D., Chief Executive Officer of Legend Biotech. “MRD negativity is a prognostic marker of prolonged survival outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma. The significantly increased overall and sustained MRD negativity rates reinforce CARVYKTI as a transformative therapeutic option versus the standard of care for multiple myeloma patients as early as the second line.”\n\nData from CARTITUDE-4 supported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission (EC) approval of CARVYKTI® earlier this year for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy (LOT), including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and are refractory to lenalidomide.1 CARVYKTI® is the first and only BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have had at least one prior line of therapy. Globally, CARVYKTI is now commercially available in five countries and has been utilized by over 4,000 patients.\n\n**ASH Presentations ( December 7-10, 2024)**\n\n**Abstract Title** | **Authors** | **Session Details**  \n---|---|---  \nCiltacabtagene Autoleucel (Cilta-cel) vs Standard of Care (SoC) in Patients with Lenalidomide-Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) After 1–3 Lines of Therapy: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity in the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 Trial | Rakesh Popat, Albert Oriol, Michele Cavo, Lionel Karlin, Irit Avivi, Wilfried Roeloffzen, Seok Jin Kim, Brea Lipe, Noffar Bar, Noemi Horvath, Andrew Spencer, Chang Ki Min, Diana Chen, Quanlin Li, Katherine Li, Ana Slaughter, Carolina Lonardi, Nina Benachour, Arnab Ghosh, Martin Vogel, Nikoletta Lendvai, Tamar Lengil, Nitin Patel, Octavio Costa Filho, Erika Florendo, Yi Lin | **ORAL 1032****Session Name**: 655.

Among patients with deaths occurring within the first 10 months from randomization, a greater proportion (29/208; 14%) occurred in the CARVYKTI**®** arm compared to (25/211; 12%) in the control arm. Of the 29 deaths that occurred in the CARVYKTI**®** arm within the first 10 months of randomization, 10 deaths occurred prior to CARVYKTI**®** infusion, and 19 deaths occurred after CARVYKTI**®** infusion. Of the 10 deaths that occurred prior to CARVYKTI**®** infusion, all occurred due to disease progression, and none occurred due to adverse events. Of the 19 deaths that occurred after CARVYKTI**®** infusion, 3 occurred due to disease progression, and 16 occurred due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were due to infection (n=12).\n\n**CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS)** , including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** for RRMM in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies (N=285), CRS occurred in 84% (238/285), including ≥ Grade 3 CRS (ASCT 2019) in 4% (11/285) of patients. Median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 7 days (range: 1 to 23 days). CRS resolved in 82% with a median duration of 4 days (range: 1 to 97 days). The most common manifestations of CRS in all patients combined (≥ 10%) included fever (84%), hypotension (29%) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (11%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include pyrexia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak syndrome, and supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. CRS occurred in 78% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (3% Grade 3 to 4) and in 95% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4). Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Please see Section 5.4; Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS).\n\nEnsure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of CARVYKTI**®**.\n\nOf the 285 patients who received CARVYKTI**®** in clinical trials, 53% (150/285) patients received tocilizumab; 35% (100/285) received a single dose, while 18% (50/285) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 14% (39/285) of patients received at least one dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS.\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI**®** infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, immediately institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.\n\nCounsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.\n\n**NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES** , which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Neurologic toxicities included ICANS, neurologic toxicity with signs and symptoms of parkinsonism, GBS, immune mediated myelitis, peripheral neuropathies, and cranial nerve palsies. Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of these neurologic toxicities, and on the delayed nature of onset of some of these toxicities. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention for further assessment and management if signs or symptoms of any of these neurologic toxicities occur at any time.\n\nAmong patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies for RRMM, one or more neurologic toxicities occurred in 24% (69/285), including ≥ Grade 3 cases in 7% (19/285) of patients. Median time to onset was 10 days (range: 1 to 101) with 63/69 (91%) of cases developing by 30 days. Neurologic toxicities resolved in 72% (50/69) of patients with a median duration to resolution of 23 days (range: 1 to 544). Of patients developing neurotoxicity, 96% (66/69) also developed CRS. Subtypes of neurologic toxicities included ICANS in 13%, peripheral neuropathy in 7%, cranial nerve palsy in 7%, parkinsonism in 3%, and immune mediated myelitis in 0.4% of the patients.\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS): Patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** may experience fatal or life-threatening ICANS following treatment with CARVYKTI**®** , including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS.\n\nAmong patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, ICANS occurred in 13% (36/285), including Grade ≥3 in 2% (6/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of ICANS was 8 days (range: 1 to 28 days). ICANS resolved in 30 of 36 (83%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 3 days (range: 1 to 143 days). Median duration of ICANS was 6 days (range: 1 to 1229 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. Of patients with ICANS, 97% (35/36) had CRS. The onset of ICANS occurred during CRS in 69% of patients, before and after the onset of CRS in 14% of patients respectively.\n\nImmune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3) and in 23% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (3% Grade 3). The most frequent ≥2% manifestations of ICANS included encephalopathy (12%), aphasia (4%), headache (3%), motor dysfunction (3%), ataxia (2%), and sleep disorder (2%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI**®** infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of ICANS. Rule out other causes of ICANS symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ICANS for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\n\nParkinsonism: Neurologic toxicity with parkinsonism has been reported in clinical trials of CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, parkinsonism occurred in 3% (8/285), including Grade ≥ 3 in 2% (5/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of parkinsonism was 56 days (range: 14 to 914 days). Parkinsonism resolved in 1 of 8 (13%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 523 days. Median duration of parkinsonism was 243.5 days (range: 62 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. The onset of parkinsonism occurred after CRS for all patients and after ICANS for 6 patients.\n\nParkinsonism occurred in 1% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (no Grade 3 to 4) and in 6% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4).\n\nManifestations of parkinsonism included movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and personality changes. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of parkinsonism that may be delayed in onset and managed with supportive care measures. There is limited efficacy information with medications used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease for the improvement or resolution of parkinsonism symptoms following CARVYKTI**®** treatment.\n\nGuillain-Barré Syndrome: A fatal outcome following GBS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®** despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. Symptoms reported include those consistent with Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, encephalopathy, motor weakness, speech disturbances, and polyradiculoneuritis.\n\nMonitor for GBS. Evaluate patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy for GBS. Consider treatment of GBS with supportive care measures and in conjunction with immunoglobulins and plasma exchange, depending on severity of GBS.\n\nImmune Mediated Myelitis: Grade 3 myelitis occurred 25 days following treatment with CARVYKTI**®** in CARTITUDE-4 in a patient who received CARVYKTI**®** as subsequent therapy. Symptoms reported included hypoesthesia of the lower extremities and the lower abdomen with impaired sphincter control. Symptoms improved with the use of corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. Myelitis was ongoing at the time of death from other cause.\n\nPeripheral Neuropathy occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7% (21/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (3/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 57 days (range: 1 to 914 days). Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 11 of 21 (52%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 58 days (range: 1 to 215 days). Median duration of peripheral neuropathy was 149.5 days (range: 1 to 692 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off.\n\nPeripheral neuropathies occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3 to 4) and in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (2% Grade 3 to 4). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. Patients who experience peripheral neuropathy may also experience cranial nerve palsies or GBS.\n\nCranial Nerve Palsies occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, cranial nerve palsies occurred in 7% (19/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (1/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of cranial nerve palsies was 21 days (range: 17 to 101 days). Cranial nerve palsies resolved in 17 of 19 (89%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 66 days (range: 1 to 209 days). Median duration of cranial nerve palsies was 70 days (range: 1 to 262 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. Cranial nerve palsies occurred in 9% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (1% Grade 3 to 4) and in 3% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (1% Grade 3 to 4).\n\nThe most frequent cranial nerve affected was the 7th cranial nerve. Additionally, cranial nerves III, V, and VI have been reported to be affected.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of cranial nerve palsies. Consider management with systemic corticosteroids, depending on the severity and progression of signs and symptoms.\n\n**HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH)/MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION SYNDROME (MAS)** : Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 1% (3/285) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 99 days of receiving CARVYKTI**®** , with a median onset of 10 days (range: 8 to 99 days) and all occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. The manifestations of HLH/MAS included hyperferritinemia, hypotension, hypoxia with diffuse alveolar damage, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, cytopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction and respiratory failure.\n\nPatients who develop HLH/MAS have an increased risk of severe bleeding. Monitor hematologic parameters in patients with HLH/MAS and transfuse per institutional guidelines. Fatal cases of HLH/MAS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**.\n\nHLH is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards.\n\n**CARVYKTI****®****REMS** : Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, CARVYKTI**®** is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTI**®** REMS.\n\nFurther information is available at [https://www.carvyktirems.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cRy-U1QA21Jm-1NdGz4Nw9g-rA8ZLgGKrx0zKfCuqdIOhES-fjIaj0oX_7wGiLn31clz_E9H58HqHv9H6dmznER8H5NgJzme2lzJjQHvDYoInPLvSmUj9YPJ0_OYtu_u) or 1-844-672-0067.\n\n**PROLONGED AND RECURRENT CYTOPENIAS** : Patients may exhibit prolonged and recurrent cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CARVYKTI**®** infusion. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by day 30 following CARVYKTI**®** infusion occurred in 62% (176/285) of the patients and included thrombocytopenia 33% (94/285), neutropenia 27% (76/285), lymphopenia 24% (67/285) and anemia 2% (6/285). After Day 60 following CARVYKTI**®** infusion 22%, 20%, 5%, and 6% of patients had a recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia respectively, after initial recovery of their Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Seventy-seven percent (219/285) of patients had one, two, or three or more recurrences of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias after initial recovery of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Sixteen and 25 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, at the time of death.\n\nMonitor blood counts prior to and after CARVYKTI**®** infusion. Manage cytopenias with growth factors and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines.\n\n**INFECTIONS** : CARVYKTI**®** should not be administered to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections, occurred in patients after CARVYKTI**®** infusion.\n\nAmong patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, infections occurred in 57% (163/285), including ≥Grade 3 in 24% (69/285) of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 6%, bacterial infections in 5%, and fungal infections in 1% of patients. Overall, 5% (13/285) of patients had Grade 5 infections, 2.5% of which were due to COVID-19. Patients treated with CARVYKTI**®** had an increased rate of fatal COVID-19 infections compared to the standard therapy arm.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after CARVYKTI**®** infusion and treat patients appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to the standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 5% of patients after CARVYKTI**®** infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care, as medically indicated. Counsel patients on the importance of prevention measures. Follow institutional guidelines for the vaccination and management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19.\n\nViral Reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Perform screening for Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or any other infectious agents if clinically indicated in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice.\n\n**HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA:** can occur in patients receiving treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia adverse event was reported in 36% (102/285) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500mg/dl after infusion in 93% (265/285) of patients.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500mg/dl, after infusion occurred in 94% (267/285) of patients treated. Fifty-six percent (161/285) of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post CARVYKTI**®** for either an adverse reaction or prophylaxis.\n\nMonitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with CARVYKTI**®** and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dL. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis.\n\nUse of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following CARVYKTI**®** treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during CARVYKTI**®** treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**.\n\n**HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS** occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 5% (13/285), all of which were ≤ Grade 2. Manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions included flushing, chest discomfort, tachycardia, wheezing, tremor, burning sensation, non-cardiac chest pain, and pyrexia.\n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in CARVYKTI**®**. Patients should be carefully monitored for 2 hours after infusion for signs and symptoms of severe reaction. Treat promptly and manage patients appropriately according to the severity of the hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n**SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES:** Patients treated with CARVYKTI**®** may develop secondary malignancies. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, myeloid neoplasms occurred in 5% (13/285) of patients (9 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 case of myelodysplastic syndrome followed by acute myeloid leukemia). The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasms was 447 days (range: 56 to 870 days) after treatment with CARVYKTI**®**. Ten of these 13 patients died following the development of myeloid neoplasms; 2 of the 13 cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia have also been reported in the post-marketing setting. T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies, including CARVYKTI**®**. Mature T-cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusions and may include fatal outcomes.\n\nMonitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-526-7736 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples.\n\n**EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES:** Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status, seizures, neurocognitive decline, or neuropathy, patients receiving CARVYKTI**®** are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following CARVYKTI**®** infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period, and in the event of new onset of any neurologic toxicities.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20%) are pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infections-pathogen unspecified, cough, chills, diarrhea, nausea, encephalopathy, decreased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea, edema, viral infections, coagulopathy, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) include lymphopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreased, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.\n\nPlease read full [Prescribing Information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mG5IG-DTzs3zHG1Qm8eTuicgsy2NiZKJZcb1DRy8UHq4zfwKSISGzgHAOKCzvn3fg5oagRaNJWrxhjdogwGFEGpfTbzZDdEFUhCVLbx71IG8wyCjMWDyZs2FHQkUUfMV-U0LpTi9_hD0e6-mXjCPduzvYdiPJ1Yg7cq2GTTaQY7Be9NXT0lQvwqBlHkn0KQ31ZPlQ6hGiJbVM7Yc85o6ZA==), including Boxed Warning, for CARVYKTI®.\n\n**ABOUT CARVYKTI****®****(CILTACABTAGENE AUTOLEUCEL; CILTA-CEL)**\n\nCiltacabtagene autoleucel is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, which involves reprogramming a patient’s own T-cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that identifies and eliminates cells that express BCMA. The cilta-cel CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells.1\n\nIn December 2017, Legend Biotech entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop and commercialize cilta-cel. In February 2022, cilta-cel was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the brand name CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In April 2024, cilta-cel was approved for the second-line treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and are refractory to lenalidomide.\n\nIn May 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted conditional marketing authorization of CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In September 2022, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved CARVYKTI®. Cilta-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. in December 2019 and in China in August 2020. In addition, cilta-cel received a PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Commission in April 2019. Cilta-cel also received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA in February 2019, from the European Commission in February 2020, and from the Pharmaceuticals and Medicinal Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan in June 2020. In March 2022, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recommended by consensus that the orphan designation for cilta-cel be maintained on the basis of clinical data demonstrating improved and sustained complete response rates following treatment.\n\n**ABOUT CARTITUDE-4**\n\nCARTITUDE-4 ([NCT04181827](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PgdD9oiVNF2LWvhOFbMnb_opQTvtYDY9cMVSmO8HYrWyvdLrikFmaCEfj35Vu-oIRn-9KTxjtWhTmLLt1bst7NPkbD0N5gxk0MP7OYPX5OYAnfuVGm9nGWbPu3us4mw7fB8Pmd4uC3i5B86LZuAuSNTnzHl0MYBYOr9EGQCC1K8=)) is an ongoing, international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD.2\n\n**ABOUT MULTIPLE MYELOMA**\n\nMultiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.3 In 2024, it is estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and more than 12,000 people will die from the disease in the U.S.4 While some patients with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.5\n\n**ABOUT LEGEND BIOTECH**\n\nLegend Biotech is a global biotechnology company dedicated to treating, and one day curing, life-threatening diseases.
