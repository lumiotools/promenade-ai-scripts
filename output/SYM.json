The Company is implementing measures designed to improve internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses.\n\nAs disclosed on November 18, 2024 in its earnings press release, as Symbotic was reviewing its business processes and preparing its full year financial statements, the company identified occurrences during fiscal year 2024 where goods and services, primarily relating to specific milestone achievements, were expensed prior to the time that the corresponding milestones were achieved. This resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cost of revenue. Given that Symbotic recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis, this resulted in the acceleration of recognition of revenue. As a result of identifying these occurrences, Symbotic’s earnings press release included restated financial results for the interim quarters of fiscal year 2024.\n\nSubsequently, on November 25, 2024, Symbotic identified errors in its revenue recognition related to cost overruns that will not be billable on certain deployments, which additionally impacted system revenue recognized in the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024. As a result, gross profit, income (loss) before income tax, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA1 were also impacted. The company estimates the total impact of correcting these errors will be to lower system revenue, system gross profit, income (loss) before income tax, and adjusted EBITDA1 by $30 million to $40 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to the financial results released on November 18, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Symbotic is also revising its outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 based on its analysis of these deployments. Symbotic now expects revenue of $480 million to $500 million, and adjusted EBITDA2 of $12 million to $16 million.\n\nSymbotic will also be amending its Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to this matter to indicate that its financial results for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 (including those included in its earnings press release and supplemental presentation) issued on November 18, 2024 should no longer be relied upon. Symbotic is working diligently and expects to file the Form 10-K and the amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the interim periods of fiscal year 2024 on or before the expiration of the fifteen-calendar day extension period.\n\n1Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” The impact of the error corrections on adjusted EBITDA and income (loss) before tax are expected to be the same. Symbotic is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss because income tax expense cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. 2 Symbotic is not providing guidance for net loss, which is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA, because information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to net loss is unavailable to it without unreasonable effort. Symbotic is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of Symbotic’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for stock-based compensation.\n\n**ABOUT SYMBOTIC**\n\nSymbotic is an automation technology leader reimagining the supply chain with its end-to-end, A.I.-powered robotic and software platform.

This press release contains financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”), including adjusted EBITDA. Symbotic defines adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net loss excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; CEO transition charges; joint venture formation fees; restructuring charges; equity financing transaction costs; equity method investment; and other non-recurring items that may arise from time to time. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures Symbotic uses may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding the results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, in isolation from, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See notes (1) and (2) above for a discussion of the reasons why a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss is not presented herein.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, but not limited to, Symbotic’s expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning our possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, backlog or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or similar expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the ability of or expectations regarding Symbotic to:\n\n  * maintain the listing of the Symbotic Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq;\n  * comply with laws and regulations applicable to its business;\n  * stay abreast of modified or new laws and regulations applying to its business;\n  * successfully defend litigation;\n  * issue equity securities in connection with future transactions;\n  * meet future liquidity requirements and, if applicable, comply with restrictive covenants related to long-term indebtedness;\n  * timely and effectively remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n  * anticipate rapid technological changes; and\n  * effectively respond to general economic and business conditions.\n\n\n\nForward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n\n  * the future performance of our business and operations;\n  * expectations regarding revenues, expenses, adjusted EBITDA and anticipated cash needs;\n  * expectations regarding cash flow, liquidity and sources of funding;\n  * expectations regarding capital expenditures;\n  * the anticipated benefits of Symbotic’s leadership structure;\n  * the effects of pending and future legislation;\n  * business disruption;\n  * disruption to the business due to Symbotic’s dependency on certain customers;\n  * increasing competition in the warehouse automation industry;\n  * any delays in the design, production or launch of our systems and products;\n  * the failure to meet customers’ requirements under existing or future contracts or customer’s expectations as to price or pricing structure;\n  * any defects in new products or enhancements to existing products;\n  * the fluctuation of operating results from period to period due to a number of factors, including the pace of customer adoption of our new products and services and any changes in our product mix that shift too far into lower gross margin products; and\n  * any consequences associated with joint ventures and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.\n\n\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024. These risk factors will be important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. These forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith, and Symbotic believes there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding our financial performance, financial position and cash flows as of and for periods ended on certain dates and to present information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because of their inherent uncertainty and to appreciate the limited purposes for which they are being used by management. While we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available to management, there is no assurance that such assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on that date. Symbotic is not under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the statements set forth in the reports that Symbotic has filed or will file from time to time with the SEC.\n\nIn addition to factors previously disclosed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, and those identified elsewhere in this press release, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: failure to realize the benefits expected from adding to our base of outsourcing partners; risks related to the GreenBox joint venture and the effects of pending and future legislation.\n\nThis communication is not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering an investment in Symbotic and is not intended to form the basis of an investment decision in Symbotic. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release and other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC and other regulatory agencies and made by our directors, officers, other employees and other persons authorized to speak on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT**\n\nCharlie AndersonVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development [ir@symbotic.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MIAkthZuYUkAs87jdMP57ox5V5xex2LV9JQM8bOMXhPEFZ2d9LaRQj0iEHAk0dQhdNgyr4up0X8--4-puRYjVA==)\n\n**MEDIA INQUIRIES**\n\nKimberly ZminkowskiDirector, Marketing[mediainquiry@symbotic.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6S66jfzAcXlvNHZpCoI_T-tnyS7CSJnknE5qbY8lnIGS7cjeMdn_nMstuR_OvFB8U9XRaQ6AxPaUPZIEV5qG3ZeFQj5lpyrhHRidjlOJquETl7cNF9dCzUU_1DiNlnOB)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NzdiMjE3NDAtZGYxOC00OWZhLWJjYTEtMDkwZWI5YmY1ZmQ5LTEyNTY0NTU=/tiny/Symbotic-Inc-.png)\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9226/pdf)\n\n## Site - Social Media\n\n[ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/symbotic/)\n\n[ Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Symbotic)\n\n[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/symbotictweet?lang=en)\n\n## Site - Investor Tools\n\n[ Email Alerts](/resources/email-alerts)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://ir.symbotic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/symbotic-provides-update-restatement-fiscal-year-2024-financial&t=Symbotic Inc. - Symbotic Provides Update to Restatement of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results and First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Symbotic Inc. - Symbotic Provides Update to Restatement of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results and First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook+https://ir.symbotic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/symbotic-provides-update-restatement-fiscal-year-2024-financial \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://ir.symbotic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/symbotic-provides-update-restatement-fiscal-year-2024-financial&title=Symbotic Inc. - Symbotic Provides Update to Restatement of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results and First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook \"LinkedIn\")\n\n\n"

Symbotic posted revenue of $577 million, net income of $28 million and adjusted EBITDA1 of $55 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. In the same quarter of fiscal 2023, Symbotic had revenue of $392 million, a net loss of $45 million and adjusted EBITDA1 of $13 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand decreased by $143 million from the prior quarter to $727 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Symbotic reported revenue of $1,822 million, reflecting 55% growth year over year, a net loss of $51 million, and adjusted EBITDA1 of $96 million.\n\n“I’m pleased with our performance this year, as our focus on innovation and customer success has delivered robust growth. This year’s results, driven by the hard work and dedication of our team, underscore the strength of our long-term strategy and commitment to driving sustainable, long-term growth for our customers, shareholders, and employees,” said Rick Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Symbotic. “We look forward to building on this momentum and continuing to deliver exceptional results and value for our stakeholders in the year ahead.”\n\n“We are pleased to finish the fiscal year with another quarter of strong revenue growth, along with a recovery in our gross margin to historical levels,” said Symbotic Chief Financial Officer, Carol Hibbard. “Looking forward to the fiscal first quarter of 2025, we expect continued strong topline growth with stable gross margins, along with targeted investments to capture an expanding set of opportunities.”\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Symbotic expects revenue of $495 million to $515 million, and adjusted EBITDA2 of $27 million to $31 million.\n\n**RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FISCAL 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nWe have restated our financial statements for the quarters within fiscal year 2024 with respect to our accounting of goods and services received. As we were reviewing our business processes and preparing our full year financial statements, we identified occurrences during fiscal year 2024 where goods and services, primarily relating to specific milestone achievements, were expensed prior to the time that the corresponding milestones were achieved. This resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cost of revenue. Given that we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis, this resulted in the acceleration of recognition of revenue. The quarterly statements of operations and statements of cash flows numbers included in this earnings press release have been restated to record cost of revenue and revenue in the periods in which the milestones were achieved, and the comparisons presented are based on the restated amounts. Given that this first occurred in fiscal year 2024 and we identified this matter in preparing the fiscal year 2024 financial statements, these represent timing differences between quarters with no impact to full-year fiscal year 2024 results. In connection with our decision to restate the previously reported quarters, we also recorded other individually insignificant items affecting fiscal 2024 that were also timing related.\n\nAs a result of the restatement of the financial results for the previously reported quarters, we will be filing amendments to Form 10-Qs for fiscal year 2024 to reflect the amounts that are included in this earnings press release. Our Form 8-K with respect to this matter will indicate that our financial statements for those periods should no longer be relied upon. We are not restating any other previously issued financial statements in connection with these matters.\n\nWe plan to timely file our Form 10-K next week and that filing will include our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the 2024 fiscal year. We expect to complete that evaluation over the next week.\n\nA summary of our restated amounts for each of the quarters of fiscal year 2024 is included in this release. In addition, we are posting on our investor relations website a supplemental presentation that details the variances between the previously reported fiscal 2024 quarterly amounts and the restated amounts, which will also be filed as an exhibit to our Form 8-K with respect to this matter.\n\n**WEBCAST INFORMATION**\n\nSymbotic will host a webcast today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results. The webcast link is: [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/go/Symbotic-Q4-2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tQqEl0Lwxdbj1A-b4bFBoWLVqhJTpVt-NIgPdoILr3Jwb05wFd4aIFf47_uUNKTmRWTaDF60oAX5wsknHFtFAAyaG0-dr9jo7UCfAMtcY1OJVStcQuyzHeHDv-CGRpBhcDdrmrvPZ1HxssB4boilTMfmqKz58BqAZyjT2Yjw7lqPMK9PWAVWMZlDLW7yFyvN).\n\n__________________________________1 Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” See the tables below for reconciliations to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure.2 Symbotic is not providing guidance for net loss, which is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA, because information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to net loss is unavailable to it without unreasonable effort. Symbotic is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of Symbotic’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for stock-based compensation.\n\n**ABOUT SYMBOTIC**\n\nSymbotic is an automation technology leader reimagining the supply chain with its end-to-end, A.I.-powered robotic and software platform.

This press release contains financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures Symbotic uses may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding the results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, in isolation from, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are reconciled to their closest reported U.S. GAAP financial measures. Symbotic recommends that investors review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\n\nSymbotic defines adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net income or loss excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; business combination transaction expenses; CEO transition charges; joint venture formation fees; restructuring charges; equity financing transaction costs; equity method investment; and other non-recurring items that may arise from time to time. Symbotic defines adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP gross profit excluding the following items: depreciation; stock-based compensation; and restructuring charges. Symbotic defines adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. Symbotic defines free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software development costs. In addition to Symbotic’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Symbotic believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, and free cash flow non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in evaluating the performance of Symbotic’s business because they highlight trends in its core business.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, but not limited to, Symbotic’s expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning our possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, backlog or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or similar expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the ability of or expectations regarding Symbotic to:\n\n  * meet the technical requirements of existing or future supply agreements with its customers, including with respect to existing backlog;\n  * expand its target customer base and maintain its existing customer base;\n  * realize the benefits expected from the GreenBox joint venture; the Commercial Agreement with GreenBox, Symbotic’s July 2024 acquisition of developed technology intangible assets, and the commercial agreements with Walmart de México y Centroamérica;\n  * realize its outlook, including its system gross margin;\n  * anticipate industry trends;\n  * maintain and enhance its system;\n  * maintain the listing of the Symbotic Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq;\n  * execute its growth strategy;\n  * develop, design and sell systems that are differentiated from those of competitors;\n  * execute its research and development strategy;\n  * acquire, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property;\n  * attract, train and retain effective officers, key employees or directors;\n  * comply with laws and regulations applicable to its business;\n  * stay abreast of modified or new laws and regulations applying to its business;\n  * successfully defend litigation;\n  * issue equity securities in connection with future transactions;\n  * meet future liquidity requirements and, if applicable, comply with restrictive covenants related to long-term indebtedness;\n  * timely and effectively remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n  * anticipate rapid technological changes; and\n  * effectively respond to general economic and business conditions.\n\n\n\nForward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n\n  * the future performance of our business and operations;\n  * expectations regarding revenues, expenses, adjusted EBITDA and anticipated cash needs;\n  * expectations regarding cash flow, liquidity and sources of funding;\n  * expectations regarding capital expenditures;\n  * the anticipated benefits of Symbotic’s leadership structure;\n  * the effects of pending and future legislation;\n  * business disruption;\n  * disruption to the business due to Symbotic’s dependency on certain customers;\n  * increasing competition in the warehouse automation industry;\n  * any delays in the design, production or launch of our systems and products;\n  * the failure to meet customers’ requirements under existing or future contracts or customer’s expectations as to price or pricing structure;\n  * any defects in new products or enhancements to existing products;\n  * the fluctuation of operating results from period to period due to a number of factors, including the pace of customer adoption of our new products and services and any changes in our product mix that shift too far into lower gross margin products; and\n  * any consequences associated with joint ventures and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.\n\n\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024. These risk factors will be important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. These forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith, and Symbotic believes there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding our financial performance, financial position and cash flows as of and for periods ended on certain dates and to present information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because of their inherent uncertainty and to appreciate the limited purposes for which they are being used by management. While we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available to management, there is no assurance that such assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on that date. Symbotic is not under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the statements set forth in the reports that Symbotic has filed or will file from time to time with the SEC.\n\nIn addition to factors previously disclosed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, and those identified elsewhere in this press release, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: failure to realize the benefits expected from adding to our base of outsourcing partners; risks related to the GreenBox joint venture and the effects of pending and future legislation.\n\nAny financial projections in this press release or discussed in the webcast are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond Symbotic’s control. While all projections are necessarily speculative, Symbotic believes that the preparation of prospective financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of projections in this communication should not be regarded as an indication that Symbotic, or its representatives, considered or considers the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events.\n\nAnnualized, projected and estimated numbers are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\n\nThis communication is not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering an investment in Symbotic and is not intended to form the basis of an investment decision in Symbotic. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release and other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC and other regulatory agencies and made by our directors, officers, other employees and other persons authorized to speak on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT**\n\nCharlie Anderson Vice President,

Symbotic posted revenue of $577 million, net income of $28 million and adjusted EBITDA1 of $55 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. In the same quarter of fiscal 2023, Symbotic had revenue of $392 million, a net loss of $45 million and adjusted EBITDA1 of $13 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand decreased by $143 million from the prior quarter to $727 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Symbotic reported revenue of $1,822 million, reflecting 55% growth year over year, a net loss of $51 million, and adjusted EBITDA1 of $96 million.\n\n“I’m pleased with our performance this year, as our focus on innovation and customer success has delivered robust growth. This year’s results, driven by the hard work and dedication of our team, underscore the strength of our long-term strategy and commitment to driving sustainable, long-term growth for our customers, shareholders, and employees,” said Rick Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Symbotic. “We look forward to building on this momentum and continuing to deliver exceptional results and value for our stakeholders in the year ahead.”\n\n“We are pleased to finish the fiscal year with another quarter of strong revenue growth, along with a recovery in our gross margin to historical levels,” said Symbotic Chief Financial Officer, Carol Hibbard. “Looking forward to the fiscal first quarter of 2025, we expect continued strong topline growth with stable gross margins, along with targeted investments to capture an expanding set of opportunities.”\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Symbotic expects revenue of $495 million to $515 million, and adjusted EBITDA2 of $27 million to $31 million.\n\n**RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FISCAL 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nWe have restated our financial statements for the quarters within fiscal year 2024 with respect to our accounting of goods and services received. As we were reviewing our business processes and preparing our full year financial statements, we identified occurrences during fiscal year 2024 where goods and services, primarily relating to specific milestone achievements, were expensed prior to the time that the corresponding milestones were achieved. This resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of cost of revenue. Given that we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis, this resulted in the acceleration of recognition of revenue. The quarterly statements of operations and statements of cash flows numbers included in this earnings press release have been restated to record cost of revenue and revenue in the periods in which the milestones were achieved, and the comparisons presented are based on the restated amounts. Given that this first occurred in fiscal year 2024 and we identified this matter in preparing the fiscal year 2024 financial statements, these represent timing differences between quarters with no impact to full-year fiscal year 2024 results. In connection with our decision to restate the previously reported quarters, we also recorded other individually insignificant items affecting fiscal 2024 that were also timing related.\n\nAs a result of the restatement of the financial results for the previously reported quarters, we will be filing amendments to Form 10-Qs for fiscal year 2024 to reflect the amounts that are included in this earnings press release. Our Form 8-K with respect to this matter will indicate that our financial statements for those periods should no longer be relied upon. We are not restating any other previously issued financial statements in connection with these matters.\n\nWe plan to timely file our Form 10-K next week and that filing will include our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the 2024 fiscal year. We expect to complete that evaluation over the next week.\n\nA summary of our restated amounts for each of the quarters of fiscal year 2024 is included in this release. In addition, we are posting on our investor relations website a supplemental presentation that details the variances between the previously reported fiscal 2024 quarterly amounts and the restated amounts, which will also be filed as an exhibit to our Form 8-K with respect to this matter.\n\n**WEBCAST INFORMATION**\n\nSymbotic will host a webcast today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results. The webcast link is: [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/go/Symbotic-Q4-2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tQqEl0Lwxdbj1A-b4bFBoWLVqhJTpVt-NIgPdoILr3Jwb05wFd4aIFf47_uUNKTmRWTaDF60oAX5wsknHFtFAAyaG0-dr9jo7UCfAMtcY1OJVStcQuyzHeHDv-CGRpBhcDdrmrvPZ1HxssB4boilTMfmqKz58BqAZyjT2Yjw7lqPMK9PWAVWMZlDLW7yFyvN).\n\n__________________________________1 Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” See the tables below for reconciliations to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure.2 Symbotic is not providing guidance for net loss, which is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA, because information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to net loss is unavailable to it without unreasonable effort. Symbotic is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of Symbotic’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for stock-based compensation.\n\n**ABOUT SYMBOTIC**\n\nSymbotic is an automation technology leader reimagining the supply chain with its end-to-end, A.I.-powered robotic and software platform. Symbotic reinvents the warehouse as a strategic asset for the world’s largest retail, wholesale, and food & beverage companies. Applying next-generation technology, high-density storage and machine learning to solve today's complex distribution challenges, Symbotic enables companies to move goods with unmatched speed, agility, accuracy and efficiency. As the backbone of commerce, Symbotic transforms the flow of goods and the economics of the supply chain for its customers.

This press release contains financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures Symbotic uses may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding the results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, in isolation from, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are reconciled to their closest reported U.S. GAAP financial measures. Symbotic recommends that investors review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\n\nSymbotic defines adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net income or loss excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; business combination transaction expenses; CEO transition charges; joint venture formation fees; restructuring charges; equity financing transaction costs; equity method investment; and other non-recurring items that may arise from time to time. Symbotic defines adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP gross profit excluding the following items: depreciation; stock-based compensation; and restructuring charges. Symbotic defines adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. Symbotic defines free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software development costs. In addition to Symbotic’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Symbotic believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, and free cash flow non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in evaluating the performance of Symbotic’s business because they highlight trends in its core business.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, but not limited to, Symbotic’s expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning our possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, backlog or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or similar expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the ability of or expectations regarding Symbotic to:\n\n  * meet the technical requirements of existing or future supply agreements with its customers, including with respect to existing backlog;\n  * expand its target customer base and maintain its existing customer base;\n  * realize the benefits expected from the GreenBox joint venture; the Commercial Agreement with GreenBox, Symbotic’s July 2024 acquisition of developed technology intangible assets, and the commercial agreements with Walmart de México y Centroamérica;\n  * realize its outlook, including its system gross margin;\n  * anticipate industry trends;\n  * maintain and enhance its system;\n  * maintain the listing of the Symbotic Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq;\n  * execute its growth strategy;\n  * develop, design and sell systems that are differentiated from those of competitors;\n  * execute its research and development strategy;\n  * acquire, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property;\n  * attract, train and retain effective officers, key employees or directors;\n  * comply with laws and regulations applicable to its business;\n  * stay abreast of modified or new laws and regulations applying to its business;\n  * successfully defend litigation;\n  * issue equity securities in connection with future transactions;\n  * meet future liquidity requirements and, if applicable, comply with restrictive covenants related to long-term indebtedness;\n  * timely and effectively remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting;\n  * anticipate rapid technological changes; and\n  * effectively respond to general economic and business conditions.\n\n\n\nForward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n\n  * the future performance of our business and operations;\n  * expectations regarding revenues, expenses, adjusted EBITDA and anticipated cash needs;\n  * expectations regarding cash flow, liquidity and sources of funding;\n  * expectations regarding capital expenditures;\n  * the anticipated benefits of Symbotic’s leadership structure;\n  * the effects of pending and future legislation;\n  * business disruption;\n  * disruption to the business due to Symbotic’s dependency on certain customers;\n  * increasing competition in the warehouse automation industry;\n  * any delays in the design, production or launch of our systems and products;\n  * the failure to meet customers’ requirements under existing or future contracts or customer’s expectations as to price or pricing structure;\n  * any defects in new products or enhancements to existing products;\n  * the fluctuation of operating results from period to period due to a number of factors, including the pace of customer adoption of our new products and services and any changes in our product mix that shift too far into lower gross margin products; and\n  * any consequences associated with joint ventures and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.\n\n\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024. These risk factors will be important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. These forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith, and Symbotic believes there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding our financial performance, financial position and cash flows as of and for periods ended on certain dates and to present information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because of their inherent uncertainty and to appreciate the limited purposes for which they are being used by management. While we believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available to management, there is no assurance that such assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on that date. Symbotic is not under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the statements set forth in the reports that Symbotic has filed or will file from time to time with the SEC.\n\nIn addition to factors previously disclosed in Symbotic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, and Symbotic’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, and those identified elsewhere in this press release, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: failure to realize the benefits expected from adding to our base of outsourcing partners; risks related to the GreenBox joint venture and the effects of pending and future legislation.\n\nAny financial projections in this press release or discussed in the webcast are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond Symbotic’s control. While all projections are necessarily speculative, Symbotic believes that the preparation of prospective financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of projections in this communication should not be regarded as an indication that Symbotic, or its representatives, considered or considers the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events.\n\nAnnualized, projected and estimated numbers are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\n\nThis communication is not intended to be all-inclusive or to contain all the information that a person may desire in considering an investment in Symbotic and is not intended to form the basis of an investment decision in Symbotic. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release and other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC and other regulatory agencies and made by our directors, officers, other employees and other persons authorized to speak on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT**\n\nCharlie Anderson Vice President,
