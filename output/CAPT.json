This was achieved by converting outstanding debt and third party equity holders to CAPT equity, and subsequently selling the subsidiary for nominal consideration\n\n\n\n**Gary Garrabrant, Chairman and CEO of Captivision, commented** : “We are pleased with the strong growth of sales during the first six months of 2024, especially in combination with increasing profit margins. With the recent conversion of debt into equity, strategic debt financing and restructuring of our European operation, we have significantly improved our financial position during the first six months of 2024. We recognize our investors’ strong support as we position Captivision for multiple business catalysts and important milestones.\n\n“Further, we’re excited about upcoming developments that we believe will be transformative for our company and our stakeholders. We are continuing to build on the momentum of our half-year financials as well as recent announcements of our partnerships with leading entertainment, hospitality and gaming companies. Notable collaborations so far this year include the Mohegan INSPIRE Entertainment Resort and Activision’s Call of Duty: Mobile at the Framework in the Desert event in Coachella Valley. With much in store for the remainder of the year, we expect the second half of 2024 to be pivotal for our company in multiple respects.”\n\n**Half-year 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Revenue** increased by $2.8 million, or 22%, to $15.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of the Company’s products and the completion of installations on a select number of meaningful, previously announced projects, primarily the Mohegan INSPIRE Entertainment Resort, the Coex Magok convention center in Seoul and the UE Garden Hotel & Resort on Japan’s Boso Peninsula.\n\n**Cost of sales** increased by $0.5 million, or 7%, to $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the higher amounts of products sold and installations completed.\n\n**Gross margin** increased to 56% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 50% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the completion of the forementioned projects. A higher proportion of the costs associated with these projects was previously recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Selling and administrative expenses** increased by $11.1 million, or 223%, from $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. This change was primarily due to higher legal, accounting, and compliance costs related to the company’s transition to a publicly traded entity.\n\n**Net loss** for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $9.3 million, compared to a net profit of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the increase in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the increase in revenues.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company's existing sources of liquidity as of June 30, 2024 included cash and cash equivalents of $0.7 million and net trade receivables of $9.4 million.\n\n**About Captivision**\n\nCaptivision is a pioneering manufacturer of media glass, combining IT building material and architectural glass.

This was achieved by converting outstanding debt and third party equity holders to CAPT equity, and subsequently selling the subsidiary for nominal consideration\n\n\n\n**Gary Garrabrant, Chairman and CEO of Captivision, commented** : “We are pleased with the strong growth of sales during the first six months of 2024, especially in combination with increasing profit margins. With the recent conversion of debt into equity, strategic debt financing and restructuring of our European operation, we have significantly improved our financial position during the first six months of 2024. We recognize our investors’ strong support as we position Captivision for multiple business catalysts and important milestones.\n\n“Further, we’re excited about upcoming developments that we believe will be transformative for our company and our stakeholders. We are continuing to build on the momentum of our half-year financials as well as recent announcements of our partnerships with leading entertainment, hospitality and gaming companies. Notable collaborations so far this year include the Mohegan INSPIRE Entertainment Resort and Activision’s Call of Duty: Mobile at the Framework in the Desert event in Coachella Valley. With much in store for the remainder of the year, we expect the second half of 2024 to be pivotal for our company in multiple respects.”\n\n**Half-year 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Revenue** increased by $2.8 million, or 22%, to $15.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of the Company’s products and the completion of installations on a select number of meaningful, previously announced projects, primarily the Mohegan INSPIRE Entertainment Resort, the Coex Magok convention center in Seoul and the UE Garden Hotel & Resort on Japan’s Boso Peninsula.\n\n**Cost of sales** increased by $0.5 million, or 7%, to $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the higher amounts of products sold and installations completed.\n\n**Gross margin** increased to 56% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 50% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the completion of the forementioned projects. A higher proportion of the costs associated with these projects was previously recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Selling and administrative expenses** increased by $11.1 million, or 223%, from $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. This change was primarily due to higher legal, accounting, and compliance costs related to the company’s transition to a publicly traded entity.\n\n**Net loss** for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $9.3 million, compared to a net profit of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the increase in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the increase in revenues.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company's existing sources of liquidity as of June 30, 2024 included cash and cash equivalents of $0.7 million and net trade receivables of $9.4 million.\n\n**About Captivision**\n\nCaptivision is a pioneering manufacturer of media glass, combining IT building material and architectural glass.
