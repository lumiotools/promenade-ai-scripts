(the “Company” or “Modivcare”) (Nasdaq: MODV), a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a platform of integrated supportive care solutions focused on improving health outcomes, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Summary: **\n\n  * Service revenue of $702.0 million increased 2.2% from the third quarter of 2023 \n\n\n  * Net loss of $26.6 million, or negative $1.87 per diluted common share \n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $43.2 million, adjusted net income (1) of $6.4 million and adjusted EPS (1) of $0.45 per diluted common share \n\n\n  * Cash provided by operating activities during the quarter of $9.3 million and free cash flow (2) of $1.5 million \n\n\n  * Contract receivables, net of contract payables, of $63.1 million as of September 30, 2024 \n\n______________________________  \n---  \n(1) |  Non-GAAP financial measure reconciliations and other related information about non-GAAP financial measures provided below.   \n(2) |  Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by us as cash flow from operations less our capital expenditures during the period of $7.7 million that is included in our purchase of property and equipment line in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows provided below.   \n  \n“This quarter has demonstrated positive momentum, reflected in both operational enhancements and strengthened relationships, even amid shifts in the broader healthcare market. We delivered solid third-quarter results, reporting $43 million of adjusted EBITDA and a 2% increase in consolidated revenue, driven primarily by 5% growth in our personal care services segment,” stated L. Heath Sampson, President and CEO. “During the quarter, we proactively amended our credit agreement, securing temporary relief on debt covenants. Our bank group continues to be constructive and supportive as we work toward a long-term solution for our covenants that provides us with the time to thoughtfully and strategically assess the best approach to de-lever our balance sheet and optimize value for stakeholders. Additionally, we achieved significant collections in contract receivables, reducing net receivables by $55 million, and we made meaningful progress in resetting our capitated payment thresholds within our shared risk NEMT contracts, as contractually designed. These actions are expected to improve our cash conversion cycle and enhance future free cash flow.” \n\nSampson continued, “Our transformation efforts have laid a strong foundation across each segment, positioning us to meet our client needs today while anticipating tomorrow’s demands in this dynamic market. Our strategic initiatives are driving substantial cost savings in our NEMT segment, with a strong deal pipeline encompassing new business, renewals, and expansions. Our personal care services segment is steadily growing with improving margins, while remote patient monitoring margins have risen to 37%, supported by operational efficiencies and delivering innovative value to our clients. We are confident in our ability to further differentiate our offerings, achieve cost savings, and drive growth in 2025. We remain fully committed to creating value within each segment, deleveraging our balance sheet, and ultimately enhancing stakeholder value.” \n\n**Guidance***\n\nWe affirm our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges as follows ($ in millions): \n\nFiscal Year 2024   \n---  \nRevenue  |  $2,700 - $2,900   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $170 - $180   \n  \nThe Company continues to expect Adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 10% in 2025, based on current 2024 guidance. \n\n*Guidance excludes the effects of any future merger, acquisition or disposition activity and is based on the current operating environment. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported $702.0 million in revenue, a 2.2% increase from the $686.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2023. NEMT segment revenue grew by $6.3 million or 1.3% and PCS segment revenue grew by $8.5 million or 4.7%, while RPM segment revenue declined $0.3 million or 1.7%, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOur operating income was $5.3 million, or 0.7% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to operating income of $12.0 million, or 1.8% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $26.6 million, or negative $1.87 per diluted common share, compared to net loss of $4.3 million, or negative $0.30 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net loss for the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 was driven by an increase in interest expense of $10.6 million as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.8 million that was incurred during the third quarter of 2024 related to the refinancing of our Senior Notes due 2025. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $43.2 million, or 6.2% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $51.3 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $6.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, compared to adjusted net income of $20.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nCash provided by operations during the quarter was $9.3 million as compared to $53.5 million of cash provided by operations during the third quarter of 2023. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the quarter include a decrease in contract receivables of $55.4 million, net, and a decrease in contract payables of $39.6 million, net. Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter was $7.7 million, primarily due to capitalized investments in technology and purchases of monitoring devices. Net cash provided by financing activities during the quarter was $36.3 million, which resulted in a quarter ended balance on the Company's revolving credit facility of $228.0 million. \n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company successfully refinanced its $500.0 million Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 at a redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes were redeemed in conjunction with the funding of a Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call**\n\nModivcare will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results on Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before: (1) interest expense, net; (2) provision (benefit) for income taxes; and (3) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3) settlement related costs; (4) a one-time payor collection settlement; (5) stock-based compensation; (6) impairment of goodwill; (7) loss on debt extinguishment; and (8) equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenue, net. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is calculated as net income (loss) before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3) settlement related costs; (4) a one-time payor collection settlement; (5) stock-based compensation; (6) impairment of goodwill; (7) loss on debt extinguishment; (8) equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax; (9) intangible asset amortization expense; and (10) the income tax impact of such adjustments. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding as calculated for Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Adjusted G&A expense is calculated as G&A expense before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3) settlement related costs; and (4) stock-based compensation. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operations less our applicable capital expenditures included in our purchase of property and equipment line in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures that are not included in the discussion above are included below. We do not provide guidance for net income (loss) in this presentation on a basis consistent with GAAP or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure (Adjusted EBITDA) to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (net income (loss)) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict items contained in the GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts. Our non-GAAP performance measures exclude expenses and amounts that are not driven by our core operating results and may be one time in nature. Excluding these expenses makes comparisons with prior periods as well as to other companies in our industry more meaningful. We believe such measures allow investors to gain a better understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing operations of our business. We consider our core operations to be the ongoing activities to provide services from which we earn revenue, including direct operating costs and indirect costs to support these activities. As a result, our net income or loss in equity investee is excluded from these measures, as we do not have the ability to manage the venture, allocate resources within the venture, or directly control its operations or performance. Our free cash flow presentation (as applicable) reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed together with our GAAP results, provides management, investors, and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Our use of the term free cash flow is not intended to imply, and no inference should be made, however, that any reported amounts are free to be used without restriction for discretionary expenditures, as our use of these funds may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, including our credit facility, and otherwise earmarked for other non-discretionary expenditures. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the “Company” or “Modivcare”) (Nasdaq: MODV), a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a platform of integrated supportive care solutions focused on improving health outcomes, through its Higi service and in collaboration with the Michigan Center for Rural Health (MCRH), is proud to announce the successful completion of its 18-month Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) pilot program designed to enhance healthcare delivery in three rural Michigan hospitals. \n\nThe pilot, funded by the Michigan Health Endowment Fund’s 2022 Special Projects and Emerging Ideas Initiative, was implemented with the goal of increasing digital health capacity and access to care for the participating rural, independent critical access hospitals, while capturing lessons learned to be shared with rural health stakeholders throughout the state of Michigan. This pioneering initiative, conducted at Helen Newberry Joy Hospital in Newberry, McKenzie Health System in Sandusky, and Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital in Manistique, demonstrated remarkable success in improving patient outcomes, increasing care access in a rural setting, and reducing clinical burden for healthcare providers. \n\nThe program in these three communities, whose average population is 2,000, saw significant success in enrolling patients referred directly by their primary care providers (PCPs) or local care managers, with 117 eligible patients referred (all of whom had been diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, and/or congestive heart failure) and an impressive 48.72 percent enrollment rate. Patients introduced to RPM by their trusted care providers enrolled at rates more than eight times higher than those who received a referral via letter or cold call. \n\nOf the patients monitored during the pilot, a cohort of 46 patients had a continuous six months of uninterrupted engagement and blood pressure monitoring, allowing for rigorous analysis of health impact. Among these patients, the number of individuals with controlled blood pressure readings doubled, increasing from 39 percent at the start to 78 percent by the end of the pilot period. Patients with previously uncontrolled hypertension experienced an average reduction of 27 mmHg systolic and 11 mmHg diastolic, achieving blood pressure readings in the normal range. According to the [National Institute of Health](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC9288358%2F&esheet=54136279&newsitemid=20241023310298&lan=en-US&anchor=National+Institute+of+Health&index=1&md5=16c96bc0b30e9a98b380a1afa5463b54), such reductions correlate with over a 20 percent reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events, underscoring the RPM program’s potential to significantly improve long-term health outcomes. In addition to the strong blood pressure improvements, many participating patients also improved their blood glucose and weight. \n\nEngagement was strongest amongst patients who were homebound or had limited social support, further validating the importance of RPM in addressing gaps in care for rural, isolated populations. While connectivity issues presented a barrier, through the use of cellular-enabled devices, the program achieved a device failure rate of less than 10 percent. \n\n“This pilot project has proven that striking the balance between relationship-driven care and technology-forward solutions can be transformative in rural healthcare,” said L. Heath Sampson, President and Chief Executive Officer. “By leveraging RPM technology to foster personal care relationships to provide ongoing support to rural hospitals and their patients, we are improving outcomes and allowing healthcare teams to work more efficiently, ultimately improving the health and well-being of Michigan’s rural residents.” \n\nThe RPM pilot program demonstrated the significant potential of remote monitoring to improve healthcare delivery in rural settings, where access to traditional healthcare is exceptionally challenging. \n\n“We are thrilled with the outcomes of this pilot and the positive impact it has had on patients and healthcare providers alike,” said Michael Beaulieu, MD, FAAFP, Chief Medical Officer for Helen Newberry Joy Hospital. “RPM has the ability to reshape rural healthcare, providing continuous care outside of the traditional office setting while reducing the workload for clinicians.” \n\nAs a result of this program, two of the three activations have continued providing RPM as a benefit and a comprehensive [ _Remote Patient Monitoring Playbook_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrandfolder.com%2Fs%2F8wt3p968bkt4rbbnn3xvfcs&esheet=54136279&newsitemid=20241023310298&lan=en-US&anchor=Remote+Patient+Monitoring+Playbook&index=2&md5=2cb81e11240887cd64c66aa8c2bf5364) has been developed to support similar healthcare organizations in adopting and implementing RPM solutions, aimed at improving patient care in rural and underserved areas through real-world guidance and actionable implementation plans. \n\n“The Michigan Center for Rural Health extends its heartfelt thanks to the teams at Helen Newberry Joy Hospital, McKenzie Health System, and Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital for investing their time and energy into the RPM pilot. By participating in the RPM pilot, not only did they make a positive impact on the health and wellness of their patients, but they also are making a difference beyond their geographical footprints through the distribution of the playbook,” said John Barnas, Executive Director of MCRH. \n\nAs RPM technology continues to evolve, healthcare organizations across the nation are increasingly turning to these tools to deliver proactive, personalized care. By partnering with rural hospitals through this initiative, MCRH and Modivcare are bridging the healthcare access gap in underserved areas. \n\n**About Modivcare**\n\nModivcare Inc.

Organization and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nModivCare Inc. (\"ModivCare\" or the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated\nsupportive care solutions for public and private payors and their members. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health (\"SDoH\") by\nconnecting members to essential care services. By doing so, ModivCare helps health plans manage risks, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation (\"NEMT\"), personal care services (\"PCS\"), and remote patient monitoring solutions\n(\"RPM\"), which serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations. The technology-enabled operating model in its NEMT segment includes the\ncoordination of non-emergency medical transportation services supported by an infrastructure of core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center\nmanagement, network credentialing and claims management. Additionally, its personal care services in its PCS segment include placements of non-\nmedical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance\nperforming daily living activities in the home setting. ModivCare’s remote patient monitoring solutions in its RPM segment include the monitoring of\npersonal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operate under the Matrix Medical\nNetwork brand (“Matrix”). Matrix, which is included in the Corporate and Other segment, maintains a national network of community-based clinicians\nwho deliver in-home and on-site services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company follows accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The FASB establishes\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. References to GAAP issued by FASB in\nthese notes are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), which serves as the single source of authoritative accounting and applicable\nreporting standards to be applied for non-governmental entities. All amounts are presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial\ninformation, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures\nrequired by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of the\nresults of the interim periods have been included.\nThe Company has made estimates relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and certain disclosures in the\npreparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOperating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024. Management has evaluated events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date and through the date these\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC and considered the effect of such events in the preparation of these\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 included in this Form 10-Q has been derived from audited financial\nstatements at that date, but does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nReclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nManagement's Liquidity Plans and Going Concern Considerations\nASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern, requires Management to assess a Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern for a period of one year from the date of financial statement issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The\naccompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\n9\nare prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the\nsatisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nSince February 26, 2024, the date the Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the SEC, the Company has faced a lengthened time interval\nbetween earning revenue and collecting receivables under outstanding contracts with some customers due to complexities in Medicare, Medicaid, and\nnongovernmental payor arrangements. This prolonged interval between the Company fulfilling its performance obligations and collecting the cash owed\nfor its services from its customers, which the Company historically has not experienced to this extent, has lengthened collection periods and increased the\nuncertainty concerning the timing of the collection of these corresponding outstanding contract receivables.\nAs of the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, Management determined that the extended collection\nperiods and uncertainty concerning the timing of the collection of outstanding contract receivables has changed the Company’s forecasts of its ability to\nmeet certain financial covenants in its debt instruments, specifically related to the Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant in the amended Credit Agreement (as\ndefined in Note 9, Debt). As a result, it has been determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to meet its obligations as they come\ndue within one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nWhile the Company continues to monitor cash generated from operations, available credit, and other liquid assets, sustaining operations relies\nheavily on the timely collection of contract receivables, which were approximately $110.4 million at September 30, 2024, and compliance with the Total\nNet Leverage Ratio covenant in its Credit Agreement, as amended to date. Failure to meet this covenant or others could cause obligations under the\nRevolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9, Debt), the Term Loan Facility (as defined in Note 9, Debt), and the Company’s Notes due 2029 (as defined\nin Note 9, Debt), to become immediately due and payable, and the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy such obligations. In such event, the\nCompany would expect to be required to restructure its existing debt or seek additional equity or debt financing to meet its obligations and maintain its\nexistence as a going concern.\nTo address compliance with the financial covenants in the Company's debt instruments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nentered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to its Credit Agreement on September 30, 2024. This amendment increased the maximum\npermitted Total Net Leverage Ratio under the amended Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the \"Relief Period\") to\n6.50:1.00 from 5.25:1.00. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Credit Agreement for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, at which time the Company's Total Net Leverage Ratio was 5.59:1.00. The Company did not amend its Total Net\nLeverage Ratio for periods beyond September 30, 2024 and may need to do so in order to remain compliant with its covenants for the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and beyond.\nManagement intends to undertake additional actions including continued discussions with its bank group on a collaborative long-term relief\namendment to support ongoing compliance with its financial covenants and take other measures to further address these issues, support the funding of\noperations and improve liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that any long-term relief amendment or additional funds will be available when\nneeded on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, or in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to satisfy its obligations or sustain operations in\nthe future.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn May 11, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") declared the end of the public health emergency (\"PHE\") for the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. While the Company has continued to experience increased trip volume, service hours, and caregiver visits each year following the\npandemic, structural changes in the industry as a result of the pandemic, as well as ongoing constraints on the labor market, specifically related to the strain\non healthcare professionals, could continue to have an adverse impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company continues to actively monitor\nthe structural changes to the industry and the impact these have on the business and results of operations with emphasis on protecting the health and safety\nof its employees, maximizing the availability of its services and products to support SDoH, and supporting the operational and financial stability of its\nbusiness.\nFederal, state, and local authorities have taken several actions designed to assist healthcare providers in providing care to COVID-19 and other\npatients and to mitigate the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Legislative actions taken by the federal government include the CARES\nAct and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\"ARPA\"). Through the CARES Act, the federal government has authorized payments to be distributed to\nhealthcare providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (\"Provider Relief Fund\" or \"PRF\"). Through ARPA the Coronavirus\nState and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (\"SLFRF\") was established to send relief payments to state and local governments impacted by the pandemic to\nassist with responding to the PHE including the economic hardships that continue to impact communities and to respond to workers performing essential\nwork during the COVID-19 PHE, including providers. These funds are not subject to\n10\nrepayment provided the Company is able to attest to and comply with any terms and conditions of such funding, as applicable. See discussion of\ngovernment grants at Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingencies, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) which establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels\ndepending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels based on the observability of inputs are defined as follows:\n– Level 1: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices in active markets as of the\nmeasurement date for identical assets or liabilities.\n– Level 2: Significant Other Observable Inputs – inputs to the valuation methodology are based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nin active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that\nare observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n– Level 3: Significant Unobservable Inputs – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and\nconsiders factors specific to the asset or liability. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents,\naccounts receivable (net of allowance for credit losses), current assets and current liabilities was equal to or approximated fair value due to their short-term\nnature or proximity to current market rates. Fair values for the Company's publicly traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices, when\navailable, and for the Company's nonpublic debt are based on lender quotes, when available. See Note 9, Debt, for the fair value of the Company's long-\nterm debt.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, and more frequently if\nevents and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) the loss or modification of\nsignificant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or\nassessment by a regulator, or (5) a significant decline in the Company’s stock price.\nWhen evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment suggests that it is more likely than not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative assessment and compares the fair value of\nthe reporting unit to its carrying value and to the extent the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n11\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill test on July 1 during which it performed a quantitative test comparing the carrying value of the\nCompany's reporting units with their respective fair value. The fair value of the Company's reporting units was estimated using both the income approach\nand the market valuation approach. The income approach produces an estimated fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows\nthe Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. Estimates included in the discounted cash flow model are primarily Level 3 inputs and\ninclude the discount rate, which the Company determines based on adjusting an industry-wide weighted-average cost of capital for size, geography, and\ncompany specific risk factors, long-term rates of growth and profitability of the Company’s business, working capital effects and planned capital\nexpenditures. The market approach produces an estimated fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly\ntraded entities in similar lines of business. The Company’s significant estimates in the market approach include the selected similar companies with\ncomparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and the multiples the Company applies to earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a $105.3 million impairment of goodwill within its RPM reporting unit and\nan aggregate $183.1 million impairment of goodwill within its PCS and RPM reporting units, respectively. For both periods, the Company determined that\nbased on its qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, factors existed which required the Company to test its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nassets for impairment. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional details.\nInternal-use Software and Cloud Computing Arrangements\nThe Company develops and implements software for internal use to enhance the performance and capabilities of the technology infrastructure.\nThe costs incurred for the development of the internal-use software are capitalized when they meet the internal-use software capitalization criteria outlined\nin ASC 350-40 and are included within \"Property and equipment, net\" on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized costs are\namortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, capitalized costs associated with the internal-use software, net of accumulated amortization were $26.3 million and $21.3 million,\nrespectively. The amount of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $6.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nAmortization expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $1.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled $4.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nIn addition to acquired software, the Company capitalizes costs associated with cloud computing arrangements (“CCA”) that are service\ncontracts. The CCA include services which are used to support certain internal corporate functions as well as technology associated with revenue-\ngenerating activities. The capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related CCA. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, capitalized costs associated with CCA, net of accumulated amortization were $12.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The\namount of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $9.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Amortization\nexpense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled $3.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue as it transfers promised services directly to its customers at the amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing these services. The Company's performance obligations are driven by\nits different segments of business and primarily consist of integrated service offerings to provide non-emergency medical transportation, personal care\nservices, or remote monitoring services directly to its customers. The Company receives payment for providing these services from third-party payors that\ninclude federal, state, and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, and private consumers. In the NEMT segment, the Company's\nperformance obligation is to stand ready to perform transportation-related activities, including the management, fulfillment, and recordkeeping activities\nassociated with such services. In the PCS segment, the Company's performance obligation is to deliver patient care services in accordance with the nature\nand frequency of services outlined in each contract. In the RPM segment, the Company's performance obligation is to stand ready to perform monitoring\nservices in the form of personal emergency response system monitoring, vitals monitoring, and other monitoring services, as contractually agreed upon.\nThe Company satisfies substantially all of its performance obligations over time and recognizes revenue over time instead of at points in time which aligns\nthe pattern of transfer of promised services with the value received by the customer for the performance completed to date.\nThe Company holds different contract types under its different segments of business. In the NEMT segment, there are both capitated contracts,\nunder which payors pay a fixed amount monthly per eligible member and revenue is recognized over each distinct service period, and fee-for-service\n(\"FFS\") contracts, under which the Company bills and collects a specified\n12\namount for each service that is provided and revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient. In the PCS segment, contracts are also\nFFS and service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amount from patients and third-party payors for services rendered and revenue is\nrecognized using the right to invoice practical expedient. Under RPM contracts, payors pay per-enrolled-member-per-month, based on enrolled\nmembership, and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. For each contract type, the Company determines the transaction price based on the\ngross charges for services provided, reduced by estimates for contractual adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews from third-party\npayors. The Company determines the estimated revenue adjustments at each segment based on its historical experience with various third-party payors and\nprevious results from the claims and adjudication process. The PCS segment uses the portfolio approach to determine the estimated revenue adjustments.\nSee further information in Note 4, Revenue Recognition.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Company periodically receives government grants and other forms of government assistance which are not generated from the Company's\ncontractual performance obligations under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Funding received from governmental entities under\ngovernment programs generally requires that the recipient attests to and complies with certain terms and conditions of receiving the funding. Government\ngrant distributions have been received primarily under the CARES Act PRF and the ARPA SLFRF to provide economic relief and stimulus to address the\nhealth and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as from other entities that provide funds with specific stipulations on the usage of these\nfunds. Distributions received are targeted to assist with incremental health care related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic\nand provide stimulus to support long-term growth and recovery. When received, these government grants are generally recorded on the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" until the time at which there is reasonable assurance the\nconditions of the grant will be met, at which point they can be recognized on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. Once\nrecognized, the Company records the funds as \"Grant income\" if the grant is related to the loss of revenues or as an offset to \"Service expense\" if the grant\nis used to offset certain costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. The Company received grant distributions of $2.2 million and $6.5 million\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company received grant distributions of $16.2 million and $21.0 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no funds were\nrecognized as grant income and $1.2 million and $19.1 million, respectively, were recognized as an offset to \"Service expense.\" During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, $0.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, were recognized as grant income and $0.9 million and $7.1 million,\nrespectively, were recognized as an offset to \"Service expense\". The remaining balance is recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets\nin the \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" line item until the conditions for recognition have been met. See further information in Note 8,\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities.\nThe payments from these acts are subject to certain restrictions and possible recoupment if not used for designated purposes. As a condition to\nreceiving PRF distributions, providers must agree to certain terms and conditions, including, among other things, that the funds are being used for\nhealthcare related expenses and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19, as defined by HHS. All recipients of PRF payments are required to comply with\nthe reporting requirements described in the terms and conditions and as determined by HHS. The Company has submitted the required documents to meet\nreporting requirements for the applicable reporting periods. The Company received an audit inquiry letter from HHS related to one of the business units\nthat received PRF payments. In response, the Company has submitted all requested information and believes that the payments received are substantiated\nand within the terms and conditions defined by HHS. The Company continues to recognize these amounts as grant income. At this time, the Company is\nunaware of any other pending or upcoming audits or inquiries related to amounts received under PRF.\nAs a condition of receiving SLFRF distributions, providers must agree to use the funds to respond to the PHE or its negative economic impacts, to\nrespond to workers performing essential work by providing premium pay to eligible workers, and to offset reductions in revenue due to the COVID-19\nPHE as stipulated by the states in which the funds were received. All recipients of SLFRF distributions are required to comply with the reporting\nrequirements that the state in which the funds originated requests, in order for the states to meet the requirements as described in the terms and conditions\nas determined by the Department of the Treasury. The Company is in the process of complying with all known reporting requirements to date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt are as follows:\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU\n2023-07\"). This update improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses.\nThe enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker\n(\"CODM\") and included within each\n13\nreported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of other segment items by reportable segment and a description of the composition of other\nsegment items, require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss\nby the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss\nto make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). This\nupdate enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures including updates to the disclosures related to the rate reconciliation\nand income taxes paid. These updates improve transparency by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate\nreconciliation and requiring income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\n3. Segments\nThe Company’s reportable segments are identified based on a number of factors related to how its CODM determines the allocation of resources\nand assesses the performance of the Company’s operations. The CODM uses service revenue, net, and operating income or loss as the measures of gross\nrevenue and profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources, and uses total assets as the measure of assets attributable to each segment.\nThe Company's operating income for the reportable segments includes an allocated portion of corporate expenses to the respective segments and includes\nrevenues and all other costs directly attributable to the specific segment.\nThe Company’s reportable segments are strategic units that offer different services under different financial and operating models to the\nCompany’s customers. The segments are managed separately because each segment has its own revenue generating activities and core business processes\nin order to serve the varying needs of its members, which requires different technology and strategies to execute. The Company's CODM manages the\nCompany under four reportable segments.\n• NEMT - The Company's NEMT segment is the largest manager of non-emergency medical transportation programs for state governments and\nmanaged care organizations, or MCOs, in the U.S. This segment also holds the results of the Company's captive insurance program;\n• PCS - The Company's PCS segment provides in home personal care services to State and Managed Medicaid, Medicare, and Private Pay patient\npopulations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing activities of daily living;\n• RPM - The Company's RPM segment is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions, including personal emergency response systems\nmonitoring, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions;\n• Corporate and Other - The Company's Corporate and Other segment includes the costs associated with the Company's corporate operations as\nwell as the results of an investment in innovation related to data analytics capabilities that the Company made at the end of the first quarter of\n2023, which contributes to service revenue and service expense. The operating results of the Corporate and Other segment include activities\nrelated to executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal and certain strategic and corporate development functions for each segment, the\nresults of this investment in innovation, as well as the results of the Company's Matrix investment.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial information from operations attributable to the Company’s business segments for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n14\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nCorporate and\nNEMT PCS RPM Other Total\nService revenue, net $ 492,253 $ 188,518 $ 19,448 $ 1,818 $ 702,037\nService expense 436,549 151,745 8,018 1,622 597,934\nGeneral and administrative expense 30,758 23,823 4,332 11,990 70,903\nDepreciation and amortization 7,645 12,918 7,073 304 27,940\nOperating income (loss) $ 17,301 $ 32 $ 25 $ (12,098) $ 5,260\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of\ntax $ 151 $ — $ — $ (2,795) $ (2,644)\nEquity investment $ 2,026 $ — $ — $ 33,809 $ 35,835\nGoodwill $ 135,186 $ 415,444 $ 129,592 $ 30 $ 680,252\nTotal assets $ 525,768 $ 736,854 $ 232,633 $ 156,493 $ 1,651,748\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nCorporate and\nNEMT PCS RPM Other Total\nService revenue, net $ 1,462,236 $ 558,696 $ 58,575 $ 5,280 $ 2,084,787\nService expense 1,288,162 451,049 24,556 5,833 1,769,600\nGeneral and administrative expense 95,701 72,152 15,780 40,512 224,145\nDepreciation and amortization 22,602 38,506 20,834 853 82,795\nImpairment of goodwill — — 105,302 — 105,302\nOperating income (loss) $ 55,771 $ (3,011) $ (107,897) $ (41,918) $ (97,055)\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of\ntax $ 269 $ — $ — $ (4,131) $ (3,862)\nEquity investment $ 2,026 $ — $ — $ 33,809 $ 35,835\nGoodwill $ 135,186 $ 415,444 $ 129,592 $ 30 $ 680,252\nTotal assets $ 525,768 $ 736,854 $ 232,633 $ 156,493 $ 1,651,748\n15\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nCorporate and\nNEMT PCS RPM Other Total\nService revenue, net $ 485,951 $ 179,979 $ 19,779 $ 1,216 $ 686,925\nGrant income(1) — 551 — — 551\nService expense 428,021 143,078 6,934 1,181 579,214\nGeneral and administrative expense 25,433 20,252 5,685 18,772 70,142\nDepreciation and amortization 6,814 12,850 6,174 239 26,077\nOperating income (loss) $ 25,683 $ 4,350 $ 986 $ (18,976) $ 12,043\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of\ntax $ 142 $ — $ — $ (302) $ (160)\nEquity investment $ 1,552 $ — $ — $ 43,655 $ 45,207\nGoodwill $ 135,186 $ 415,444 $ 234,894 $ 30 $ 785,554\nTotal assets $ 512,032 $ 774,731 $ 346,257 $ 130,066 $ 1,763,086\nNine months ended September 30, 2023\nCorporate and\nNEMT PCS RPM Other Total\nService revenue, net $ 1,452,389 $ 534,435 $ 57,702 $ 3,812 $ 2,048,338\nGrant income(1) — 4,649 — — 4,649\nService expense 1,277,604 417,636 20,129 3,366 1,718,735\nGeneral and administrative expense 87,645 63,480 16,781 61,189 229,095\nDepreciation and amortization 20,319 38,590 18,087 683 77,679\nImpairment of goodwill — 137,331 45,769 — 183,100\nOperating income (loss) $ 66,821 $ (117,953) $ (43,064) $ (61,426) $ (155,622)\nEquity in net income of investee, net of tax $ 984 $ — $ — $ 1,837 $ 2,821\nEquity investment $ 1,552 $ — $ — $ 43,655 $ 45,207\nGoodwill $ 135,186 $ 415,444 $ 234,894 $ 30 $ 785,554\nTotal assets $ 512,032 $ 774,731 $ 346,257 $ 130,066 $ 1,763,086\n(1) Grant income for the PCS segment includes funding received on a periodic basis from the PRF in relation to relief under the CARES Act and funding\nreceived from the SLFRF under ARPA in relation to economic recovery to combat health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. See\nNote 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\n4. Revenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue as it transfers promised services to its customers and generates all of its revenue from contracts\nwith customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these services.\nThe Company satisfies substantially all of its performance obligations over time and recognizes revenue over time instead of at points in time.\nRevenue Contract Structure\nNEMT Capitated Contracts (per-member-per-month)\n16\nUnder capitated contracts, payors pay a fixed amount per eligible member per month. Capitation rates are generally based on expected costs and\nvolume of services. The Company assumes the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements based on per-member\nper-month fees for the number of eligible members in the payor’s program. Revenue is recognized based on the population served during the period.\nCertain capitated contracts have provisions for reconciliations, risk corridors or profit rebates. For contracts with reconciliation provisions, capitation\npayment is received as a prepayment during the month service is provided. These prepayments are reconciled based on actual cost and/or trip volume and\nmay result in refunds to the payor, or additional payments due from the payor. Contracts with risk corridor or profit rebate provisions allow for profit\nwithin a certain corridor and once the Company reaches profit level thresholds or maximums, it discontinues recognizing revenue and instead records a\nliability within the accrued contract payable account. This liability may be reduced through future increases in trip volume or periodic settlements with the\npayor. While a profit rebate provision could only result in a liability from this profit threshold, a risk corridor provision could potentially result in a\nreceivable if the Company does not reach certain profit minimums, which would be recorded in the reconciliation contract receivables account.\nNEMT Fee-for-service Contracts\nFee-for-service (\"FFS\") revenue represents revenue earned under non-capitated contracts in which the Company bills and collects a specified\namount for each service that it provides. FFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact\nof contractual allowances.\nPCS Fee-for-service Contracts\nPCS FFS revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amount from clients, patients and third-party payors for services rendered based on\nactual personal care hours provided. Payment for services received from third-party payors includes, but is not limited to, insurance companies, hospitals,\ngovernmental agencies and other home health care providers who subcontract work to the Company. Certain contracts are subject to retroactive audit and\npossible adjustment by those payors based on the nature of the contract or costs incurred. The Company makes estimates of adjustments and considers\nthese in the recognition of revenue in the period in which the related services are rendered. The difference between estimated settlement and actual\nsettlement is reported in net service revenues as adjustments become known or as years are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, or investigations.\nRPM per-member-per-month Contracts\nRPM per-member-per-month (\"PMPM\") revenue consists of revenue from monitoring services provided to the customer. Under RPM contracts,\npayors pay per-enrolled-member-per-month based on enrolled membership. Consideration is generally fixed for each type of monitoring service and\nrevenue is recognized ratably over the contract term based on the monthly fee paid by customers.\nDisaggregation of Revenue by Contract Type\nThe following table summarizes disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by contract type for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNEMT capitated contracts $ 389,110 $ 412,762 $ 1,199,506 $ 1,239,957\nNEMT FFS contracts 103,143 73,189 262,730 212,432\nTotal NEMT service revenue, net $ 492,253 $ 485,951 $ 1,462,236 $ 1,452,389\nPCS FFS contracts 188,518 179,979 558,696 534,435\nRPM PMPM contracts 19,448 19,779 58,575 57,702\nOther service revenue 1,818 1,216 5,280 3,812\nTotal service revenue, net $ 702,037 $ 686,925 $ 2,084,787 $ 2,048,338\nPayor Information\nService revenue, net, is derived from state and managed Medicaid contracts, managed Medicare contracts, as well as a small amount from private\npay and other contracts. Of the NEMT segment’s revenue, 10.7% and 11.4% were derived from one payor for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and 11.2% and 11.2% were derived from one\n17\npayor for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the PCS segment's revenue, 12.4% and 11.4% were derived from one\npayor for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12.2% and 11.3% were derived from one payor for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Equity Investment\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned a 43.6% non-controlling interest in Matrix. Pursuant to a Shareholder’s\nAgreement, affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners hold rights necessary to control the fundamental operations of Matrix. The Company accounts for its\ninvestment in Matrix under the equity method of accounting and the Company’s share of Matrix’s income or loss is recorded as “Equity in net income\n(loss) of investee, net of tax” in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations within its Corporate and Other segment.\nThe Company's gross share of Matrix's operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a loss of $3.9 million and a loss\nof $0.4 million, respectively, which is presented net of tax on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for a loss of $2.8 million and\na loss of $0.3 million, respectively. The Company's gross share of Matrix's operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was a loss\nof $5.7 million and income of $2.5 million, respectively, which is presented net of tax on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations\nfor a loss of $4.1 million and income of $1.8 million, respectively.\nThe carrying amount of the assets included in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and the maximum loss exposure\nrelated to the Company’s interest in Matrix as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $33.8 million and $39.9 million, respectively.\nSummary financial information for Matrix on a standalone basis is as follows (in thousands):\n19\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 49,951 $ 112,090\nLong-term assets $ 349,593 $ 351,143\nCurrent liabilities $ 31,174 $ 41,584\nLong-term liabilities $ 273,311 $ 314,316\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 67,654 $ 84,395 $ 235,032 $ 252,973\nOperating income (loss) $ (2,467) $ 7,593 $ 11,821 $ 32,196\nNet income (loss) $ (8,524) $ (239) $ (10,190) $ 6,976\n6.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment for its reporting units annually as of July 1, or more frequently when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that based on its qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, factors existed which\nrequired the Company to test its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. These factors included changes in key assumptions from\nthe prior year annual goodwill assessment as a result of lower than anticipated operating results during the first half of 2024 as compared to forecast which\nresulted in a decrease in the fair value of the Company's RPM reporting unit such that the fair value was less than its carrying value. As a result, during the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $105.3 million in the RPM reporting unit. This impairment is\nrecorded in “Impairment of goodwill” on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. No further impairment was taken\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company determined that based on its qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, factors existed which\nrequired the Company to test its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. These factors included a decline in the market price of the\nCompany's common stock, industry specific regulatory pressures such as Medicaid redetermination and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n(\"CMS\") proposed ruling on Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services, and general economic and market volatility. As a result, the Company performed a\nquantitative assessment and determined that the goodwill at its PCS and RPM reporting units was impaired. As such, during the second quarter of 2023,\nthe Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $183.1 million, of which $137.3 million was recorded in the PCS reporting unit and\n$45.8 million was recorded in the RPM reporting unit. No further impairment was taken during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n20\nAfter recording the respective impairments of goodwill, the associated reporting units had a combined $545.0 million of goodwill remaining as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $650.3 million as of December 31, 2023. If, among other factors, (i) the Company's equity values were to decline significantly,\n(ii) the Company experienced additional adverse impacts associated with macroeconomic factors, including increases in the estimated weighted average\ncost of capital, or (iii) the adverse impacts stemming from competition, economic, regulatory or other factors were to cause the Company's results of\noperations or cash flows to be worse than currently anticipated, the Company could conclude in future periods that additional impairment charges of\ncertain reporting units are required in order to reduce the carrying values of goodwill. Any such impairment charges could be significant.\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment are presented in the following table (in thousands):\nCorporate and\nNEMT PCS RPM Other Total\nGoodwill balance as of December 31, 2022, before cumulative\nloss $ 231,186 $ 552,775 $ 280,663 $ 30 $ 1,064,654\nAccumulated loss on impairment (96,000) — — — (96,000)\nGoodwill balance as of December 31, 2022, after cumulative loss 135,186 552,775 280,663 30 968,654\nImpairment of goodwill — (137,331) (45,769) — (183,100)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 135,186 415,444 234,894 30 785,554\nImpairment of goodwill — — (105,302) — (105,302)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 135,186 $ 415,444 $ 129,592 $ 30 $ 680,252\nThe accumulated impairment losses on goodwill totaled $384.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and $279.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of acquired payor networks, trademarks and trade names, developed technology, non-compete agreements,\nlicenses, and an assembled workforce. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the\nassets. These finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\nsuch assets may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and more frequently if\nevents occur or circumstances change that indicate an asset may be impaired. Based on the continued value of the definite-lived and indefinite-lived\nintangible assets acquired, the Company did not identify any circumstances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that would require\nan impairment test for the intangible assets.\n8. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities were comprised of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued compensation and related liabilities $ 39,834 $ 48,033\nInsurance reserves 30,336 22,014\nAccrued interest 28,073 10,498\nAccrued legal fees 16,158 10,148\nAccrued operating expenses 9,188 15,884\nAccrued government grants(1) 7,920 9,156\nDeferred revenue 3,155 2,629\nUnion pension obligation 428 1,573\nOther 10,197 7,966\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 145,289 $ 127,901\n21\n(1) Accrued government grants include payments received from government entities, such as SLFRF or other government assistance funds, to offset\nincreased expenditures for which the related expenditure has not yet been incurred and thus the related payments are deferred as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\n9. Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt and short-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDescription Date of Issuance September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSenior Unsecured Notes\n$500.0 million 5.875% due November 15, 2025 11/4/2020 $ — $ 494,011\n$500.0 million 5.000% due October 1, 2029\n8/24/2021 490,910 489,746\n(effective interest rate 5.386%)\nTerm Loan Facility\n$525.0 million SOFR + 4.750% due July 1, 2031(1) 7/1/2024 495,215 —\nTotal long-term debt $ 986,125 $ 983,757\nRevolving Credit Facility 2/3/2022 $ 228,000 $ 113,800\nCurrent Portion of Term Loan Facility(2) 7/1/2024 5,250 —\nTotal short-term debt $ 233,250 $ 113,800\n(1) The $525.0 million Term Loan Facility bears interest at (i) a SOFR-based benchmark plus 4.75% or (ii) a prime rate (or other alternate base rate)\nbenchmark plus 3.75% in the case of ABR Loans (as such terms are defined in the amended Credit Agreement) and matures on the earlier of (a)\nJuly 1, 2031 and (b) July 2, 2029 if any of the Company's 2029 Notes (as defined below) remain outstanding on that date.\n(2) The Term Loan Facility requires principal payments of $1.3 million on a quarterly basis and accordingly, a portion of the Term Loan Facility in the\namount of $5.3 million is classified as a current liability within the \"Short-term debt\" line item on the unaudited condensed balance sheets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nThe Company pays interest on the senior unsecured notes semi-annually in arrears. Principal payments are not required until the maturity date.\nDebt issuance costs of $14.5 million in relation to the issuance of the senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\") were incurred and these costs\nwere deferred and are amortized to interest cost over the term of the 2025 Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 2025 Notes on July 1, 2024\n(discussed below), the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs were recognized in the loss on debt extinguishment that was recorded during the third\nquarter of 2024. Debt issuance costs of $13.5 million were incurred in relation to the issuance of the senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"\nand, together with the 2025 Notes, the \"Notes\") and these costs were deferred and are amortized to interest cost over the term of the 2029 Notes. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the 2029 Notes had $9.1 million of unamortized deferred issuance costs that were netted against the long-term debt balance on the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the 2025 Notes were fully redeemed and thus had no associated fair value as of that date and as of December 31, 2023,\nhad a fair value of $499.2 million. The fair value of the 2029 Notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $315.0 million and $410.0\nmillion, respectively. The fair value of the Notes was determined based on quoted prices in active markets, and therefore designated as Level 1 within the\nfair value hierarchy. The indenture covering the Notes also contains a cross-default provision in the event any of the Company’s other indebtedness having\na principal amount that aggregates $50.0 million or more is accelerated prior to its express maturity. The Company was in compliance with all covenants,\nas amended by the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement discussed in detail in the Revolving Credit Facility section below, as of September 30,\n2024.\nThe 2025 Notes were redeemed in full on July 1, 2024 prior to contractual maturity, at a redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original\nprincipal amount of the 2025 Notes for a total redemption of $507.3 million, plus the payment of approximately $3.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest\non the 2025 Notes. As a result of the early redemption of the 2025 Notes, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $11.8 million on the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. This loss consisted of the redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original principal\namount\n22\nof the 2025 Notes for $7.3 million plus the recognition of the unamortized deferred issuance costs on the 2025 Notes for $4.5 million. The 2025 Notes\nwere redeemed in connection with the funding of the Term Loan Facility discussed below.\nCredit Agreement\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company is a party to the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of February 3, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an issuing bank, Truist Bank\nand Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A., Regions Bank, Bank\nof Montreal and Capital One, National Association, as co-documentation agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a\nsenior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million and sublimits for swingline\nloans, letters of credit and alternative currency loans in amounts of up to $25.0 million, $60.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The Revolving\nCredit Facility under the Credit Agreement was scheduled to mature on February 3, 2027 and the proceeds that may be drawn under the Revolving Credit\nFacility from time to time prior to maturity may be used (i) to finance working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) for general\ncorporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (including to finance capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and investments).\nOn June 26, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \"First Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement, which amended and restated\nthe maximum permitted Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement as amended by the First Amendment) under the Credit Agreement as\nfollows: for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 through September 30, 2023, 5.25:1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2023 through\nMarch 31, 2024, 5.00:1.00; for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, 4.75:1.00; and for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2024 and for the fiscal\nquarters ending thereafter, 4.50:1.00.\nOn February 22, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the \"Second Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement, which amended the\nmaximum permitted Total Net Leverage Ratio under the amended Credit Agreement as follows: for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2024 through June\n30, 2024, 5.50:1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2024 through December 31, 2024, 5.25:1.00; for the fiscal quarters ending March 31,\n2025 through September 30, 2025, 5.00:1.00, and for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2025 through March 31, 2026, 4.75:1.00. The Second\nAmendment also included a restriction on the Company's Liquidity (as defined in the Second Amendment and which is determined generally to be, as of\nany date of determination, the sum of the Company's borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility plus the amount of its unencumbered cash),\nrequiring it to be less than $100.0 million as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (the \"Liquidity Covenant\").\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things,\nextended with respect to the lenders identified in the Third Amendment the maturity date covering $255.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of the\ncommitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to February 3, 2028. The existing financial covenants under the amended Credit Agreement were\nretained for the benefit solely of the Revolving Credit Facility lenders, and the minimum liquidity level required by the Liquidity Covenant was decreased\nfrom $100.0 million to $75.0 million. Certain other financial covenants and restrictions were also modified under the amended Credit Agreement, as\npreviously disclosed. The fees associated with the Third Amendment of $0.3 million will be amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to its Credit Agreement, which increased the\nmaximum permitted Total Net Leverage Ratio under the amended Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the \"Relief Period\")\nto 6.50:1.00 from 5.25:1.00. In addition, the Fourth Amendment reduced the minimum interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to\n2.00:1.00 and increased the applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility by 0.25% until the Company delivers the required financial statements and\ncompliance certificate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $228.0 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and had\n$55.6 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 9.3% per annum. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $113.8 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under the\nRevolving Credit Facility and had $40.4 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n23\nUnder the amended Credit Agreement, the Company has an option to request an increase in the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility so long\nas, after giving effect to the incremental facility, the pro forma secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 2.70:1.00. The Company may prepay the\nRevolving Credit Facility in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ breakage and redeployment\ncosts in connection with prepayments. The unutilized portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or\nterminated by the Company at any time without penalty.\nInterest on the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility accrues at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate\nBase Rate, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA\nRate, as applicable and each as defined in the amended Credit Agreement, in each case, plus an applicable margin. With respect to the loans under the\nRevolving Credit Facility during the Relief Period as stipulated by the Fourth Amendment, the applicable margin ranges from 2.50% to 4.25% in the case\nof RFR loans, as defined in the amended Credit Agreement, and 1.50% to 3.25% in the case of the Alternate Base Rate loans, as defined in the amended\nCredit Agreement, in each case, based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears in the case of\nAlternate Base Rate loans. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on a percentage of the unused portion of the\nRevolving Credit Facility and quarterly letter of credit fees based on a percentage of the maximum amount available to be drawn under each outstanding\nletter of credit. The commitment fee and letter of credit fee range from 0.30% to 0.50% and 2.50% to 4.25%, respectively, in each case, based on the\nCompany’s Total Net Leverage Ratio.\nThe amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The\nnegative covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments,\ngive guarantees, pay dividends, sell assets and merge and consolidate. The Company's borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is currently\nlimited by, among other covenants, compliance with the Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant and the Liquidity Covenant for each fiscal period. The\nCompany was in compliance with all covenants, as amended by the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company’s present and future material domestic\nsubsidiaries, excluding certain material domestic subsidiaries that are excluded from being guarantors pursuant to the terms of the amended Credit\nAgreement. The Company’s obligations under, and each guarantor’s obligations under its guaranty of, the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first\npriority lien on substantially all of the Company’s or such guarantor’s respective assets. If an event of default occurs, the required lenders may cause the\nadministrative agent to declare all unpaid principal and any accrued and unpaid interest and all fees and expenses under the Revolving Credit Facility to be\nimmediately due and payable. All amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will automatically become due and payable upon the\ncommencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The amended Credit Agreement, as it relates to the Revolving Credit Facility, also\ncontains a cross-default to any of the Company’s indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of $40.0 million.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company, pursuant to the Third Amendment, established a new term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $525.0 million with the Term Loan Facility lenders named therein. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to (i) redeem the\nCompany's 2025 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the Third Amendment,\nand (iii) pay fees and expenses associated with such transactions. The Company paid approximately $24.4 million of deferred issuance costs with respect\nto the Term Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan Facility had $23.2 million of unamortized deferred issuance costs that were netted\nagainst the long-term balance on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2024\nwas $523.7 million, which was determined based on lender quotes for the Company's debt, and therefore designated as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy.\nThe Term Loan Facility matures on the earlier of (a) July 1, 2031 and (b) July 2, 2029 if any of the Company's 2029 Notes remain outstanding on\nthat date. Principal payments on the Term Loan Facility are required on a quarterly basis, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024, in the\namount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility outstanding on the date of issuance. All unpaid amounts of the Term\nLoan Facility shall be paid in full on the maturity date. The Term Loan Facility requires annual prepayments of a percentage of Excess Cash Flow (as\ndefined in the amended Credit Agreement); commencing with the year ending December 31, 2025 as follows: (i) 75.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as\nof the last day of such period was greater than 4.40:1.00, (ii) 50.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than\n3.90:1:00, but less than or equal to 4.40:1.00, (iii) 25.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.40:1.00, but\nless than or equal to 3.90:1.00, and (iv) 0.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was less than or equal to 3.40:1.00. The Term\nLoan Facility also requires\n24\nmandatory prepayments in the event of certain asset dispositions or casualty events. In addition, the Term Loan Facility is subject to a prepayment\npremium for the first six months after entering into the Third Amendment in the event of any repricing transaction.\nInterest on the Term Loan Facility is generally payable quarterly, in arrears, on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility at the\nfollowing rates for the interest period in effect for such borrowing: (i) a SOFR-based benchmark plus 4.75% or (ii) a prime rate (or other alternate base\nrate) benchmark plus 3.75% in the case of ABR Loans (as such terms are defined in the amended Credit Agreement). The Term Loan Facility is subject to\ncustomary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, as defined in the amended Credit Agreement. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 10.08%. The amended Credit Agreement, as it relates to the Term\nLoan Facility, also contains a cross-default to any of the Company’s indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of $40.0 million.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants, as amended by the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024.\n10. Stock-Based Compensation and Similar Arrangements\nThe Company provides stock-based compensation to employees, non-employee directors, consultants and advisors under the Company’s 2006\nLong-Term Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”). The 2006 Plan allows the flexibility to grant or award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,\nunrestricted stock, stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to eligible persons.\nStock options. The Company recognized immaterial stock-based compensation expense for non-qualified stock options (“NQs”) for the three\nmonths and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, in general and administrative expense. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 50,096\nstock options outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $116.62.\nRestricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock awards\n(\"RSAs\") and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), collectively, of $1.3 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $4.4 million and $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in general and administrative\nexpense. The Company had 15,948 unvested RSAs and 287,947 unvested RSUs outstanding at September 30, 2024 with a weighted-average grant date fair\nvalue of $48.90 and $42.28, respectively.\nPerformance-based share awards. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (\"PRSUs\") to align management’s compensation\nwith the Company's financial performance and other operational objectives and to retain key employees. Awards granted under this category are based on\nthe achievement of various targeted metrics as approved by the Compensation Committee and defined in the related PRSU Agreement. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for PRSUs is recognized over the 3-year vesting period under the straight-line attribution method. The Company recorded a reversal\nof stock-based compensation expense related to PRSUs of $0.8 million in general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 due to forfeitures that occurred during the period and recorded $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company recorded an immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense related to PRSUs for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 due to the impact of the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense during the period from forfeitures and\nrecorded $0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining expense is expected to be\nrecognized over the remainder of the 3-year requisite service period. The Company had 267,345 unvested PRSUs outstanding at September 30, 2024 with\na weighted-average grant date fair value of $46.53.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company began offering an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") with 1,000,000 shares of Common\nStock reserved for purchase pursuant to the Plan for eligible employees. The shares of Common Stock may be newly issued shares, treasury shares or\nshares acquired on the open market. Under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees may designate a dollar value or percentage of their compensation to\nbe withheld through payroll deductions, up to a maximum of $25,000 in each plan year, for the purchase of common stock at a discounted rate of 85% of\nthe lower of the market price on the first or last trading day of the offering period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany recorded an immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP. As of September 30, 2024, 966,172 shares remain\navailable for future issuance under the ESPP.\n25\n11. Loss Per Share\nThe following table details the computation of basic and diluted loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (26,604) $ (4,302) $ (177,788) $ (199,208)\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic and diluted earnings per share --\nweighted-average shares 14,253,192 14,182,839 14,224,155 14,169,537\nLoss per share:\nBasic loss per share $ (1.87) $ (0.30) $ (12.50) $ (14.06)\nDiluted loss per share $ (1.87) $ (0.30) $ (12.50) $ (14.06)\nIn a period when a net loss is reported, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive\neffect, meaning the loss per share would be reduced. Therefore, in periods where a loss is reported, there is no difference in basic and diluted loss per\nshare.\nThe following weighted-average shares were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share as the effect of their inclusion would have\nbeen anti-dilutive:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options to purchase common stock 58,948 90,579 70,183 96,725\nRestricted stock awards and restricted stock units 300,752 141,712 290,693 97,719\n12. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate to arrive at the tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 31.6% and 28.6%,\nrespectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to various tax credits, increased reserves on deferred\ntax assets, nondeductible expenses and nondeductible goodwill impairment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate\ndiffered from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, nondeductible expenses, and the nondeductible goodwill impairment.\n13. Commitments and Contingencies\nSurveys, Audits and Governmental Investigations\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may from time to time be or become subject to surveys, audits and governmental investigations\nunder or with respect to various governmental programs and state and federal laws. Agencies associated with the programs and other third-party\ncommercial payors periodically conduct extensive pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of claims data to identify possible\npayments made or authorized other than in compliance with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, documentation\nis requested from the Company and then that documentation is reviewed to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the\neligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Similarly, other state\nand federal governmental agencies conduct reviews and investigations to confirm the Company's compliance with applicable laws where it operates,\nincluding regarding employment and wage related regulations and matters. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any regulatory reviews or\nother governmental surveys, audits or investigations, but management does not expect any ongoing surveys, audits or investigations involving the\nCompany to have a\n26\nmaterial adverse effect on the business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company. Regardless of the Company's expectations,\nhowever, surveys and audits are subject to inherent uncertainties and can have a material adverse impact on the Company due to, among other reasons,\npotential regulatory orders that inhibit its ability to operate its business, amounts paid as reimbursement or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of\nmanagement resources and investigative costs.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may from time to time be or become involved in various lawsuits, some of which may seek\nmonetary damages, including claims for punitive damages. Management does not expect any ongoing lawsuits involving the Company to have a material\nimpact on the business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company. Legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties,\nhowever, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters\nfor which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order precluding particular business practices or\nrequiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material adverse impact on the business, liquidity, financial position, or results of\noperations.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies related to legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines that a range of reasonably possible losses can be estimated, the Company records an\naccrual for the most probable amount in the range. Due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of any legal proceeding, it may not be\nreasonably possible to estimate a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution. Legal fees related to all legal matters are expensed as\nincurred.\nSince 2017, one of the Company's PCS segment subsidiaries, All Metro Home Care Services of New York, Inc. d/b/a All Metro Health Care (“All\nMetro”), has been subject to a class action lawsuit in state court claiming that, among other things, All Metro failed to properly pay live-in caregivers who\nstay in patients’ homes for 24 hours per day (“live-ins”). The Company pays live-ins for 13 hours per day as supported through a written opinion letter\nfrom the New York State Department of Labor (“NYSDOL”). The New York Court of Appeals (New York's highest court) in a similar case involving this\nissue issued an order in 2019 that agreed with the NYSDOL’s interpretation to pay live-ins for 13 hours per day instead of 24 hours if certain conditions\nwere being met. Notwithstanding the court of appeals' order in the similar case, the parties to date have been unable to settle their dispute through\nmediation or otherwise, and therefore discovery in the matter is continuing. If the plaintiffs prove successful in this class action lawsuit, All Metro may be\nliable for back wages and liquidated damages dating back to November 2011. All Metro believes that it is and has been in compliance in all material\nrespects with the laws and regulations covering pay for live-in caregivers (including the conditions described by the New York Court of Appeals in its\norder), intends to continue to defend itself vigorously with respect to this matter, and the Company does not believe in any event that the ultimate outcome\nof this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\n27\nItem 2.

(\"ModivCare\" or the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that provides a suite of integrated\nsupportive care solutions for public and private payors and their members. Its value-based solutions address the social determinants of health (\"SDoH\") by\nconnecting members to essential care services. By doing so, ModivCare helps health plans manage risks, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nModivCare is a provider of non-emergency medical transportation (\"NEMT\"), personal care services (\"PCS\"), and remote patient monitoring solutions\n(\"RPM\"), which serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations. The technology-enabled operating model in its NEMT segment includes the\ncoordination of non-emergency medical transportation services supported by an infrastructure of core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center\nmanagement, network credentialing and claims management. Additionally, its personal care services in its PCS segment include placements of non-\nmedical personal care assistants, home health aides and nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance\nperforming daily living activities in the home setting. ModivCare’s remote patient monitoring solutions in its RPM segment include the monitoring of\npersonal emergency response systems, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical\nNetwork brand (“Matrix”). Matrix, which is included in our Corporate and Other segment, maintains a national network of community-based clinicians\nwho deliver in-home and on-site services.\nBusiness Outlook and Trends\nOur performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are\nexposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could\naffect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:\n• an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services including required transportation to such healthcare services\nand in-home personal care and remote patient monitoring services;\n28\n• increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses that require active and ongoing monitoring of health data which can be accomplished at a lower cost\nand result in better health outcomes through remote patient monitoring services;\n• a movement towards value-based care versus fee-for-service and cost plus care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase\nthe use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;\n• increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models and technological advances enabling\nremote engagement, including remote monitoring and similar internet-based health related services;\n• a shift in membership dynamics as a result of Medicaid redetermination efforts, the effects of which are largely complete, however there are\nseveral states still in process of completing these efforts, which have and may continue to decrease membership levels at our NEMT segment;\n• advancement of regulatory priorities, which include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") final rule, Ensuring Access to\nMedicaid Services, which, in six years, requires states to generally ensure that a minimum of 80.0% of Medicaid payments are used toward\ncompensation for direct care workers, which may lower profit margins at our PCS segment;\n• technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may\nincrease industry competitiveness;\n• managed care organizations (\"MCOs\"), Medicaid and Medicare plans increasing coverage of non-emergency medical transportation services for a\nvariety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote SDoH, and\nthis trend may be accelerated or reinforced by The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\"H.R.133\"), a component of which mandates that\nstate Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers;\n• uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, could have an effect on our debt and short-term borrowings, which may have\na negative impact on our results; and\n• the extended collection periods and uncertainty concerning the timing of the collection of outstanding contract receivables with some customers\ndue to complexities in Medicare, Medicaid, and nongovernmental payor arrangements.\nOn May 11, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") declared the end of the public health emergency (\"PHE\") for the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. During each year following the emergence of the pandemic, we have continued to experience increased trip volume, service hours,\nand caregiver visits. While this indicates increased demand for our non-emergency medical transportation, personal care and remote patient monitoring\nservices, ongoing impacts of the pandemic and implications of the current macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by high inflation rates,\nhigh interest rates, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, volatility in capital markets and growing recession risk, have had and could continue to have\nan adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For the NEMT segment, increased trip volume and utilization of non-\nemergency medical transportation services exposes us to cost containment risk as labor costs and trip costs are rising at a higher rate than reimbursement,\nwhich results in lower profit margins than previously reported. The increase in trip costs is driven, in part, by headwinds from the current macroeconomic\nenvironment which limit the NEMT segment's ability to provide services at a reasonable cost to achieve historic profit margins. These macroeconomic\ntrends also put pressure on the availability of transportation providers. Additionally, we may face staffing difficulties in our contact centers as the\nrecruitment of potential employees may be challenging amid the current labor environment, which could negatively impact the customer and member\nexperience while interfacing with our contact centers and materially adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. For the PCS segment, the\nlabor shortage, particularly related to availability of healthcare workers including caregivers, will continue to impact the volume of service hours that can\nbe provided while also driving increased wage rates, which limits our ability to be profitable in contracts with set rates for various care services.\nAdditionally, increases in the utilization of our NEMT services and reduction in payor reimbursement rates at the PCS segment could limit the ability for\nus to generate a profit despite our shift toward emphasizing the importance of value-based care. Any of these circumstances and factors could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our reputation and business and any long-term macroeconomic impacts that have arisen as a result of the pandemic could\ncontinue to change trends in the market.\nOur business environment is competitive, the structural changes in our industry related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been lasting, the labor\nmarket for healthcare professionals remains constrained, and the market price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market continues to be volatile;\nthe continuing effect of all or any of the foregoing could result in, in future periods, an impairment to the estimated fair value of the goodwill that has been\nestablished for our reporting units. As discussed elsewhere herein and under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2023, impairment tests may be required in addition to the annual impairment\ntesting that occurs on July 1st of each year if circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit\nbelow such reporting unit’s carrying value. We monitor the performance of the business and the value of our stock price and estimated fair values of our\nreporting units, among other relevant considerations, to determine if any impairments to goodwill could exist at any particular time. During the second\nquarter of 2024, we determined that based on our qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, factors existed which required us to test our goodwill for\nimpairment. These factors included lower than anticipated operating results during the first half of 2024 as compared to\n29\nforecast. As a result of our quantitative assessment during the second quarter of 2024, we determined that the goodwill at our RPM reporting unit was\nimpaired. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from our\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For further discussion of our critical accounting policies, see management’s discussion and analysis of\nfinancial condition and results of operations contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nService revenue, net. Service revenue for our NEMT segment includes the revenue generated by providing non-emergency medical transportation\nservices directly to our customers. These services are provided on either a capitated basis, which means we are paid on a per-member, per-month\n(\"PMPM\") basis for each eligible member, or on a fee-for-service (\"FFS\") basis, which means we are paid based on the volume of trips or services\nperformed. Payment for our NEMT services is received from third-party payors, predominately made up of state Medicaid agencies and MCOs.\nOur capitated contracts operate under either a full-risk or a shared-risk structure. Under full-risk contracts, payors pay a fixed amount per eligible\nmember per month and we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements for the number of eligible\nmembers in the payor's program. Under this structure, we assume the full-risk for the costs associated with arranging transportation of members through\nour network of independent transportation providers. Revenue is recognized based on the number of members served during the period. Under shared-risk\ncontracts, we have provisions for reconciliations, risk corridors, and/or profit rebates. These contracts allow for periodic reconciliations based on actual\ncost and/or trip volume and may result in refunds to the payor (contract payables), or additional payments due from the payor (contract receivables) based\non the provisions contractually agreed upon. These shared-risk contracts also allow for margin stabilization, as generally the amount received PMPM is\nadjusted for the costs to provide the transportation services. Under both contract structures, we arrange for transportation of members through our network\nof independent transportation providers, whereby we negotiate rates and remit payment to the transportation providers. However, for certain contracts, we\nassume no risk for the transportation network, credentialing and/or payments to these providers. For these contracts, we only provide administrative\nmanagement services to support the customers’ efforts to serve their clients.\nUnder FFS contracts, payors pay a specified amount for each service that we provide based on costs incurred plus an agreed-upon margin.\nFFS revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered and is reduced by the estimated impact of contractual allowances.\nService revenue for our PCS segment includes the revenue generated based on the hours incurred by our in-home caregivers to provide services to\nour customers, primarily on a FFS basis in which we earn a specified amount for each service that we provide. Payment for our PCS services is billed to\nthird-party payors which include, but are not limited to, MCOs, hospitals, Medicaid agencies and programs and other home health care providers who\nsubcontract the services of our caregivers to their patients, and individuals.\nService revenue for our RPM segment includes the sale of monitoring equipment to our third-party distributors as well as revenue generated from\nthe hours incurred by our Clinical Team for providing monitoring services to our customers, primarily on a PMPM basis for each eligible member.\nPayment for our monitoring services is billed to third-party payors which include, but are not limited to, national and regional health plans, government-\nfunded benefit programs, healthcare provider organizations, and individuals.\nGrant Income\nGrant income. We have received distributions under the ARPA Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Relief Fund (\"SLFRF\") targeted to providing\neconomic relief and stimulus to combat health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to other governmental funds.\nOperating Expenses\nService expense. Service expense for our NEMT segment includes purchased transportation, operational payroll and other operational related\ncosts. Purchased transportation includes the amounts we pay to third-party service providers and is typically dependent upon service volume. Operational\npayroll predominately includes our contact center operations, customer\n30\nadvocacy and transportation network team. Other operating expenses primarily include operational overhead costs, and operating facilities and related\ncharges. Service expense for our PCS segment includes payroll and other operational related costs for our caregivers to provide in-home care. Service\nexpense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries of employees in our contact centers, connectivity costs and occupancy costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for all segments consists principally of salaries for administrative\nemployees that support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation within this caption includes infrastructure items such as computer hardware and software,\noffice equipment, monitoring and vitals equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements. Amortization expense is generated primarily from\namortization of our intangible assets, including payor networks, trade names and developed technology.\nImpairment of goodwill. We determined that based on our qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, factors existed which required us to test\nour goodwill for impairment. As a result of such impairment test, we determined that the goodwill within our RPM reporting unit was impaired during the\nsecond quarter of 2024 and that goodwill within our PCS and RPM reporting units was impaired during the second quarter of 2023.\nOther Expenses (Income)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense consists principally of interest accrued during the period ended September 30, 2024 on our borrowings\noutstanding under the Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes, and amortization of deferred financing fees. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital\nResources” section below for further discussion of these borrowings.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. During Q3 2024, our 2025 Notes were redeemed in full prior to contractual maturity, resulting in a loss on debt\nextinguishment.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Equity in earnings of equity method investee consists of our proportionate share of equity\nearnings or losses from our Matrix equity investment held at our Corporate and Other segment, presented net of related taxes, as well as the earnings of our\ninsurance captive held at the NEMT segment, presented net of related taxes.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). We are subject to federal taxation in the United States and state taxation in the various jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\nSegment Reporting\nOur segments reflect the manner in which our operations are organized and reviewed by management. Segment results are based on how our\nCODM manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.\nWe operate four reportable business segments: NEMT, PCS, RPM, and Corporate and Other. The NEMT segment provides non-emergency\nmedical transportation services throughout the country. The PCS segment provides non-medical personal care and home health services. The RPM\nsegment provides remote patient monitoring solutions.

Service expense at our NEMT segment increased $8.5\nmillion, service expense at our PCS segment increased $8.7 million and service expense increased at our RPM segment $1.1 million. The remainder of the\nchange is related to our Corporate and Other segment. See our Results of Operations - Segments, for further discussion.\n32\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for Q3 2024 increased $0.8 million, or 1.1%, compared to Q3 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expense at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $6.8 million and at our RPM segment decreased $1.4 million. These\ndecreases were offset by an increase in general and administrative expense at our NEMT segment of $5.3 million along with an increase in general and\nadministrative expense at our PCS segment of $3.6 million. General and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of service revenue, net\ndecreased to 10.1% for Q3 2024 compared to 10.2% for Q3 2023. See our Results of Operations - Segments, for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.9 million, or 7.1% in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 primarily\nrelated to the depreciation associated with the capitalization of internal use software.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net, for Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 was $28.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for an increase of $10.6\nmillion, or 59.7% quarter over quarter. During Q3 2024, we incurred $6.6 million and $14.7 million of interest expense related to the 2029 Notes and the\nTerm Loan Facility, respectively. Since the 2025 Notes were redeemed in full on July 1, 2024, and all remaining interest was paid as part of that\ntransaction, there was no interest expense associated with the 2025 Notes during Q3 2024. The remainder of the interest expense in Q3 2024 is related to\ninterest and fees on the Credit Facility, which increased during Q3 2024 due to increased borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility as compared to Q3\n2023. Interest expense is recorded at our Corporate and Other segment.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. During Q3 2024, our 2025 Notes were redeemed in full prior to contractual maturity, resulting in a loss on debt\nextinguishment. This balance consists of the redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original principal amount of the 2025 Notes for $7.3 million\nplus the recognition of the unamortized deferred issuance costs on the 2025 Notes for $4.5 million.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Our equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, for Q3 2024 of $2.6 million and our equity in net\nloss of investee, net of tax, of $0.2 million for Q3 2023 was a result of our proportional share of the net income or loss of Matrix and our investment in a\ncaptive insurance program.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our effective tax rate to arrive at the tax benefit from operations for Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 was 31.6% and 28.6%,\nrespectively. For Q3 2024, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to various tax credits, increased reserves on\ndeferred tax assets, and nondeductible expenses. For Q3 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state\nincome taxes and nondeductible expenses.\n33\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to Nine months ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated results. The following table sets forth results of operations and the percentage of consolidated total Service revenue, net represented\nby items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which we refer to as “YTD\n2024”, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which we refer to as “YTD 2023” (in thousands):\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n% of Service % of Service\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nService revenue, net $ 2,084,787 100.0 % $ 2,048,338 100.0 %\nGrant income — — % 4,649 0.2 %\nOperating expenses:\nService expense 1,769,600 84.9 % 1,718,735 83.9 %\nGeneral and administrative expense 224,145 10.8 % 229,095 11.2 %\nDepreciation and amortization 82,795 4.0 % 77,679 3.8 %\nImpairment of goodwill 105,302 5.1 % 183,100 8.9 %\nTotal operating expenses 2,181,842 104.7 % 2,208,609 107.8 %\nOperating loss (97,055) (4.7)% (155,622) (7.6)%\nInterest expense, net 67,129 3.2 % 50,769 2.5 %\nLoss on debt extinguishment 11,797 0.6 % — — %\nLoss before income taxes and equity method investment (175,981) (8.4)% (206,391) (10.1)%\nIncome tax benefit 2,055 0.1 % 4,362 0.2 %\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax (3,862) (0.2)% 2,821 0.1 %\nNet loss $ (177,788) (8.5)% $ (199,208) (9.7)%\nService revenue, net. Consolidated service revenue, net, for YTD 2024 increased $36.4 million, or 1.8%, compared to YTD 2023. This change\nconsists of an increase in revenue of $9.8 million at our NEMT segment, an increase in revenue of $24.3 million at our PCS segment, and an increase in\nrevenue of $0.9 million at our RPM segment. The remainder of the change is related to our Corporate and Other segment. See our Results of Operations -\nSegments, for further discussion.\nGrant income. While we received approximately $16.2 million in grant distributions during YTD 2024, we did not recognize grant income, but\nrecognized a portion of these funds as an offset to service expense once they met the conditions for recognition. We received $21.0 million in grant\ndistributions during YTD 2023 and recognized $4.6 million in grant income, with the difference being recognized either as an offset to service expense, if\nwe incurred the expense for which the grants were intended to compensate, or as an accrued expense, if we have not yet incurred the expense for which the\ngrants were intended to compensate. These funds were received by our NEMT and PCS segments and are available to eligible providers who have\nhealthcare-related expenses and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 and/or meet the eligibility requirements of the related fund.\nService expense.

Payroll and related costs across all segments increased $9.8 million, which\nwas driven by an increase in payroll and related costs of $33.8 million at our PCS and RPM segments, which was partially offset by a decrease in payroll\nand related costs of $24.2 million at our NEMT segment. See our Results of Operations - Segments, for further discussion.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for YTD 2024 decreased $5.0 million, or 2.2%, compared to YTD 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expense at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $20.7 million and at our RPM segment decreased $1.0 million, which\nwas offset by an increase in general and administrative expense at our NEMT segment of $8.1 million along with an increase in general and administrative\nexpense at our PCS segment of $8.7 million. General and administrative expense, expressed as a percentage of service revenue, net decreased to 10.8% for\nYTD 2024 compared to 11.2% for YTD 2023. See our Results of Operations - Segments, for further discussion.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $5.1 million, or 6.6% in YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily\nassociated with the capitalization of internal use software.\nImpairment of goodwill. Impairment of goodwill for YTD 2024 and YTD 2023 was $105.3 million and $183.1 million, respectively, and was\ndriven by goodwill impairments that were recorded at our RPM reporting unit during YTD 2024 and at our PCS and RPM reporting units during YTD\n2023. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for YTD 2024 and YTD 2023 was $67.1 million and $50.8 million, respectively, for an increase of\n$16.4 million, or 32.2% year over year. During YTD 2024, we incurred $16.3 million, $19.9 million and $14.7 million of interest expense related to the\n2025 Notes, the 2029 Notes, and the Term Loan Facility, respectively. The remainder of the interest expense during YTD 2024 is related to interest and\nfees on the amended Credit Facility, which increased during YTD 2024 due to increased borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility as compared to YTD\n2023. Interest expense is recorded at our Corporate and Other segment.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. During Q3 2024, our 2025 Notes were redeemed in full prior to contractual maturity, resulting in a loss on debt\nextinguishment. This balance consists of the redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original principal amount of the 2025 Notes for $7.3 million\nplus the recognition of the unamortized deferred issuance costs on the 2025 Notes for $4.5 million.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax. Our equity in net loss of investee, net of tax for YTD 2024 of $3.9 million and our equity in net\nincome of investee, net of tax for YTD 2023 of $2.8 million was a result of our proportional share of the net income or loss of Matrix and our investment\nin a captive insurance program.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our effective tax rate to arrive at the tax benefit from operations for YTD 2024 and YTD 2023 was a tax benefit of\n1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. The YTD 2024 effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to various tax credits, increased\nreserves on deferred tax assets, nondeductible expenses, and the nondeductible goodwill impairment. The YTD 2023 effective tax rate differed from the\nU.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill impairment.\n35\nResults of Operations - Segments\nThe following tables set forth certain financial information attributable to our business segments for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023:\nNEMT Segment\n(in thousands, except for revenue per member per month, revenue per trip, and service expense per trip)\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n% of % of % of % of\nSegment Segment Segment Segment\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue\nOperating Results\nService revenue, net $ 492,253 100.0% $ 485,951 100.0% $ 1,462,236 100.0% $ 1,452,389 100.0%\nService expense 436,549 88.7% 428,021 88.1% 1,288,162 88.1% 1,277,604 88.0%\nGeneral and administrative expense 30,758 6.2% 25,433 5.2% 95,701 6.5% 87,645 6.0%\nDepreciation and amortization 7,645 1.6% 6,814 1.4% 22,602 1.5% 20,319 1.4%\nOperating income $ 17,301 3.5% $ 25,683 5.3% $ 55,771 3.8% $ 66,821 4.6%\nBusiness Metrics(1)\nTotal paid trips 9,418 8,824 27,257 25,761\nAverage monthly members 30,023 33,660 29,599 33,892\nRevenue per member per month $ 5.47 $ 4.81 $ 5.49 $ 4.76\nRevenue per trip $ 52.27 $ 55.07 $ 53.65 $ 56.38\nService expense per trip $ 46.35 $ 48.51 $ 47.26 $ 49.59\nUtilization 10.5 % 8.7 % 10.2 % 8.4 %\n(1) These metrics are key performance indicators that management uses to evaluate our performance. Trends established in these metrics can be used to\nevaluate current operating results, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources and understand the underlying\ndrivers of costs and revenue for our business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors in evaluating and understanding our business but\nshould not be used solely in assessing our performance. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for\nor as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein to fully evaluate and\nunderstand the business as a whole.\nOur NEMT segment is the largest manager of non-emergency medical transportation programs for state governments and MCOs in the U.S.\nService revenue, net. Service revenue, net, remained consistent in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023, with an increase of 1.3%, and remained\nconsistent in YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, with an increase of 0.7%. While average monthly membership decreased 10.8% and 12.7% for the\nQTD and YTD periods, respectively, the revenue received per member per month increased by 13.7% and 15.3% over the same periods, helping to\nmaintain a consistent revenue level. Revenue per member per month is driven by increases in trip volume. These two factors are correlated due to contract\nrepricing and the partial pass-through of costs associated with our reconciliation, risk corridor, and/or profit rebate contracts (which are considered shared-\nrisk contracts due to the reconciliation provisions).\nThe change in average monthly members is correlated to the change in revenue because a majority of our contracts are capitated, and we receive\nmonthly payments on a per member per month basis in return for full or shared risk of transportation volumes. Declines in membership over the periods\npresented were anticipated and related to Medicaid redetermination, along with certain contract losses. While membership decreased, revenue had an\noffsetting increase due to increases in the average rate received per member, which increases in line with increases in utilization or trip volume from our\nshared risk contracts. As most of our capitated contracts have been restructured to a shared risk format, revenue remained consistent despite the decline\n36\nin membership. Increases in trip volume also positively affected revenue from fee-for-service contracts due to a larger number of services performed.\nService expense. Service expense for our NEMT segment primarily consists of purchased services, which are costs paid to our third party\ntransportation providers, and payroll and related costs, which consist of salaries of employees within our contact centers and operations centers. Other\nservice expenses include occupancy costs related to our contact centers. Service expense components for the NEMT segment are shown below (in\nthousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n% of Segment % of Segment % of Segment % of Segment\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue\nPurchased services $ 383,769 78.0 % $ 363,594 74.8 % $ 1,119,248 76.5 % $ 1,085,206 74.7 %\nPayroll and related costs 40,383 8.2 % 51,655 10.6 % 131,160 9.0 % 155,388 10.7 %\nOther service expenses 12,397 2.5 % 12,772 2.6 % 37,754 2.6 % 37,010 2.5 %\nTotal service expense $ 436,549 88.7 % $ 428,021 88.1 % $ 1,288,162 88.1 % $ 1,277,604 88.0 %\nService expense increased $8.5 million, or 2.0%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023, primarily related to an increase in purchased services of\n$20.2 million, or 5.5%, which was partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs of $11.3 million, or 21.8%. Service expense increased $10.6\nmillion, or 0.8%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily related to an increase in purchased services of $34.0 million, or 3.1%, which was\noffset by a decrease in payroll and related costs of $24.2 million, or 15.6%. The decrease in payroll and related costs over both periods demonstrates\nongoing improvements from cost optimization and digitization efforts in our contact centers. Purchased services costs increased with the 6.7% higher trip\nvolume for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 and the 5.8% higher trip volume for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023. This is partially offset by lower\npurchased services cost per trip, due to reduction in trip expense from the implementation of our multi-modal strategy.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that support\nthe operations of the NEMT segment, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense\nincreased $5.3 million, or 20.9%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 and increased $8.1 million, or 9.2%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023. The\nincreases are primarily related to higher salaries for administrative employees during both periods.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.8 million, or 12.2%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3\n2023 and increased $2.3 million, or 11.2%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023.

PCS contracts are generally structured as fee-for-service contracts, with revenue driven by the number of hours worked by\nour personal care providers. Service revenue, net, increased $8.5 million, or 4.7%, for Q3 2024, as compared to Q3 2023, primarily due to 2.6% higher\nhours worked by personal care providers, as well as 2.1% higher rates earned per hour. Service revenue, net, increased $24.3 million, or 4.5%, for YTD\n2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily due to 2.1% higher hours worked by personal care providers, as well as 2.4% higher rates earned per hour\nduring the same period.\nGrant income.

Service expense for YTD 2024 increased $33.4 million, or 8.0%, as compared to YTD\n2023, primarily as a result of a 5.8% increase in service expense per hour, as well as a 2.1% increase in hours of service provided. The increases in service\nexpense per hour are driven primarily by increased wage rates for our caregivers, predominately from wage increases in New York, New Jersey, and West\nVirginia.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that support\nthe operations of the PCS segment, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense\nincreased $3.6 million, or 17.6%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 and general and administrative expense increased $8.7 million, or 13.7%, for YTD\n2024 as compared to YTD 2023. The increases are primarily related to increased legal fees from various audits and legal proceedings as well as increased\nsoftware maintenance expense related to the implementation of a home care platform in certain markets in Q3 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 and for\nYTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023. This balance primarily consists of amortization expense on the payor network intangible asset.\nImpairment of goodwill. During Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, we did not record any impairment charge on the goodwill at our PCS reporting unit.\nDuring YTD 2024 we also did not record any impairment charge on the goodwill at our PCS reporting unit. During YTD 2023, as a result of our\nquantitative goodwill assessment on July 1, we determined that the goodwill within our PCS reporting unit was impaired which resulted in an impairment\nof goodwill charge of $137.3 million.

Trends established in these metrics can be used to\nevaluate current operating results, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources and understand the underlying\ndrivers of costs and revenue for our business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors in evaluating and understanding our business but\nshould not be used solely in assessing our performance. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for\nor as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein to fully evaluate and\nunderstand the business as a whole.\nOur RPM segment is a provider of remote patient monitoring solutions and manages a comprehensive suite of services, including personal\nemergency response systems monitoring, vitals monitoring and data-driven patient engagement solutions.\nService revenue, net. RPM contracts are generally structured as a fixed fee per enrolled member per month and therefore, revenue is generally\ndriven by the number of enrolled members and the rate received per member per month. Service revenue, net, decreased $0.3 million, or 1.7%, for Q3\n2024 as compared to Q3 2023, primarily related to a 1.3% decrease in revenue per member per month paired with a small decrease in average monthly\nmembers. Service revenue, net, increased $0.9 million, or 1.5%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily related to a 2.5% increase in average\nmonthly members from YTD 2023 to YTD 2024.\nService expense. Service expense for our RPM segment primarily consists of salaries for the employees providing the remote monitoring services\nas well as occupancy costs. Service expense components for the RPM segment are shown below (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n% of Segment % of Segment % of Segment % of Segment\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Amount Revenue\nPayroll and related costs $ 4,281 22.0 % $ 3,414 17.3 % $ 12,850 21.9 % $ 9,941 17.2 %\nOther service expenses 3,737 19.2 % 3,520 17.8 % 11,706 20.0 % 10,188 17.7 %\nTotal service expense $ 8,018 41.2 % $ 6,934 35.1 % $ 24,556 41.9 % $ 20,129 34.9 %\n40\nService expense increased $1.1 million, or 15.6%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023, primarily related to an increase of $0.9 million, or\n25.4%, in payroll and related costs. Service expense increased $4.4 million, or 22.0%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily related to an\nincrease of $2.9 million, or 29.3%, in payroll and related costs. Payroll and related costs increased due to increased wages and benefits for our monitoring\nemployees as well as increased device installation costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries for administrative employees that\nindirectly support the operations, occupancy costs, marketing expenditures, insurance, and professional fees. General and administrative expense for Q3\n2024 decreased as compared to Q3 2023 by $1.4 million, or 23.8%. General and administrative expense for YTD 2024 decreased as compared to YTD\n2023 by $1.0 million, or 6.0%.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.9 million, or 14.6%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3\n2023, and increased $2.7 million, or 15.2%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, primarily related to additional depreciation expense on an increased\nnumber of RPM devices used to service the 2.5% increase in average monthly members from YTD 2023.\nImpairment of goodwill. During Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, we did not record any impairment charge on the goodwill at our RPM reporting unit.\nDuring YTD 2024 and YTD 2023, as a result of our quantitative goodwill assessment on July 1, we determined that the goodwill within our RPM\nreporting unit was impaired which resulted in an impairment of goodwill charge of $105.3 million and $45.8 million, respectively. See Note 7, Goodwill\nand Intangible Assets for additional details.\n41\nCorporate and Other Segment\n(in thousands)\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nService revenue, net $ 1,818 $ 1,216 $ 5,280 $ 3,812\nService expense 1,622 1,181 5,833 3,366\nGeneral and administrative expense 11,990 18,772 40,512 61,189\nDepreciation and amortization 304 239 853 683\nOperating loss $ (12,098) $ (18,976) $ (41,918) $ (61,426)\nOur Corporate and Other segment includes our executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal, public reporting and corporate\ndevelopment functions. This segment also includes the results of our equity investment in Matrix and the operating results of our investments in innovation\nrelated to data analytics products and solutions, which is comprised of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Higi Care, LLC (“Higi”), which was acquired during\nthe first quarter of 2023. Higi provides certain data-driven personal health technologies and also began providing virtual clinical care management services\n(the \"MSO\") through an unaffiliated professional corporation (the \"PC\") owned and operated by a licensed physician in the third quarter of 2023.\nService revenue, net and Service expense: The acquisition of Higi, which was a strategic investment in growth, contributes to service revenue and\nservice expense.\nGeneral and administrative expense and Depreciation and amortization: Our Corporate and Other segment includes costs incurred related to\nstrategy and stewardship of the other operating segments. These expenses are primarily general and administrative expenses, with a minimal amount\nrelated to depreciation. The general and administrative expense decreased $6.8 million, or 36.1%, for Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 and decreased\n$20.7 million, or 33.8%, for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023. This decrease is primarily related to lower professional service costs and lower legal\nfees, which were higher in the prior year due to executive departure.\nSeasonality\nOur NEMT and PCS segments' operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally\ndue to lower demand for transportation and in-home services during the winter season and periods with major holidays as members and patients may spend\nmore time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods. While this fluctuation is noted in terms of the use of our services\nduring these seasonal shifts, it does not have a material impact on our results of operations and therefore is not adjusted for. Our RPM segment’s operating\nincome and cash flows do not normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nShort-term capital requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, contract start-up costs on new revenue contracts and costs\nassociated with our strategic initiatives. We expect to meet our short-term cash requirements through available cash on hand, cash generated from\noperations, net of capital expenditures, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). For information regarding our long-term\ncapital requirements, see below under the caption \"Liquidity\".\nCash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $36.5 million. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents,\nexcluding restricted cash, was $48.3 million and $2.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had restricted cash of $0.5\nmillion and $0.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Restricted cash amounts are not included in our balance of cash and\ncash equivalents in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, although they are included in the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nbalance on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, access capital markets to raise equity or debt financing for various business reasons, including acquisitions,\nrepurchases of common stock, investments in our business and possible refinancing activity. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will\ndepend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing on terms acceptable to\nus at the time or at all.\n42\nYTD 2024 cash flows compared to YTD 2023\nOperating activities. Cash used in operating activities was $36.5 million for YTD 2024 compared to cash used in operating activities of $57.3\nmillion for YTD 2023. The decrease in cash used of $20.9 million between periods was primarily a result of an increase in cash provided by changes in\noperating assets and liabilities of $43.6 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were partly driven by an increase in cash collected from\ncontract receivables during YTD 2024 of $91.7 million on certain risk corridor and reconciliation contracts. This increase from the changes in operating\nassets and liabilities is partially offset by an increase in the accounts receivable and other receivables balance of $48.2 million primarily related to the\ntiming of cash receipts on our trade accounts receivable and other receivables, as well as a decrease in our contract payables of $9.5 million related to\npayments made on certain risk corridor and reconciliation contracts as compared to YTD 2023.\nInvesting activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $22.3 million in YTD 2024, which decreased by $8.9 million as compared to YTD\n2023. This decrease is related to less cash spent on purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $104.8 million for YTD 2024, compared to $82.1 million for YTD 2023. The\nincrease of $22.7 million was primarily a result of the issuance of a Term Loan Facility in the aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million which was\npartially offset by the redemption of our 2025 Notes for $507.3 million. The increase is also driven by an increase of $31.2 million in net proceeds from\nour short-term borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility during YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023, partially offset by higher debt issuance costs of\n$25.1 million related to the Third and Fourth Amendments to the Credit Agreement.\nObligations and commitments\nSenior Unsecured Notes. On November 4, 2020, we issued $500.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes\ndue on November 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Subsequently, on August 24, 2021, we issued an additional $500.0 million in the aggregate principal\namount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due on October 1, 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”). For information\nrelated to our senior unsecured notes, refer to Note 9, Debt, of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,\nItem 1, “Financial Statements”.\nThe 2025 Notes were redeemed in full on July 1, 2024 prior to contractual maturity, at a redemption premium of 1.469% on the aggregate original\nprincipal amount of the 2025 Notes for a total redemption of $507.3 million, plus the payment of approximately $3.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest\non the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes were redeemed in connection with the funding of the Term Loan Facility discussed below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. We are party to the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of February 3, 2022, (the “Credit Agreement”)\nwith JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an issuing\nbank, Truist Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Bank of America, N.A.,\nRegions Bank, Bank of Montreal and Capital One, National Association, as co-documentation agents, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Truist Securities,\nInc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement, as amended\nto date, provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes sublimits for swingline loans, letters of credit and alternative currency loans in amounts of up to $25.0 million,\n$60.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants, including an affirmative covenant regarding our Total Net Leverage Ratio,\ndetermined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, which is the ratio of (a) our total net indebtedness to (b) our earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation, amortization, and certain non-recurring charges, fees, and expenses, as set for the in the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 26, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement which amended the maximum permitted Total Net Leverage\nRatio under the Credit Agreement.\nOn February 22, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement which further amended the maximum permitted Total Net\nLeverage Ratio under the amended Credit Agreement as well as added a quarterly minimum liquidity covenant (the \"Liquidity Covenant\") that restricts us\nfrom permitting our Liquidity (as defined in the Second Amendment and which is determined generally to be, as of any date of determination, the sum of\nour available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility plus the amount of our unencumbered cash), to be less than $100.0 million as of the\nlast day of each fiscal quarter.\n43\nOn July 1, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things, extended with respect to the lenders\nidentified in the Third Amendment the maturity date covering $255.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the Revolving\nCredit Facility to February 3, 2028. The existing financial covenants under the amended Credit Agreement were retained for the benefit solely of the\nRevolving Credit Facility lenders, and the minimum liquidity level required by the Liquidity Covenant was decreased from $100.0 million to $75.0\nmillion. Certain other financial covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement were also modified by the Third Amendment, as previously\ndisclosed. The fees associated with the Third Amendment of $0.3 million will be amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn September 30, 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which amended the maximum permitted Total Net\nLeverage Ratio under the amended Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 to 6.50:1.00. In addition, the Fourth Amendment\nreduced the minimum interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to 2.00:1.00 and increased the applicable margin on the Revolving\nCredit Facility by 0.25% until we deliver the required financial statements and compliance certificate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the amended Credit Agreement and our Total Net Leverage\nRatio was 5.59:1.00.\nTerm Loan Facility. On July 1, 2024, pursuant to the Third Amendment, we established a new term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") in the\naggregate principal amount of $525.0 million with the Term Loan Facility lenders named therein. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to (i)\nredeem our 2025 Notes, (ii) repay a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the Third Amendment,\nand (iii) pay fees and expenses associated with such transactions. We incurred approximately $24.4 million of deferred financing costs with respect to the\nTerm Loan Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility matures on the earlier of (a) July 1, 2031 and (b) July 2, 2029 if any of the 2029 Notes remain outstanding on that date.\nPrincipal payments on the Term Loan Facility are required on a quarterly basis, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024, in the amount\nequal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility outstanding on the date of issuance. All unpaid amounts of the Term Loan\nFacility shall be paid in full on the maturity date. The Term Loan Facility requires annual prepayments of a percentage of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in\nthe amended Credit Agreement); commencing with the year ending December 31, 2025 as follows: (i) 75.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last\nday of such period was greater than 4.40:1.00, (ii) 50.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.90:1:00, but\nless than or equal to 4.40:1.00, (iii) 25.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.40:1.00, but less than or\nequal to 3.90:1.00, and (iv) 0.0% if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was less than or equal to 3.40:1.00. The Term Loan\nFacility also requires mandatory prepayments in the event of certain asset dispositions or casualty events. In addition, the Term Loan Facility is subject to a\nprepayment premium for the first six months after entering into the Third Amendment in the event of any repricing transaction.\nInterest on the Term Loan Facility is generally payable quarterly, in arrears, on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility at the\nfollowing rates for the interest period in effect for such borrowing: (i) a SOFR-based benchmark plus 4.75% or (ii) a prime rate (or other alternate base\nrate) benchmark plus 3.75% in the case of ABR Loans (as such terms are defined in the amended Credit Agreement). The Term Loan Facility is subject to\ncustomary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, as defined in the amended Credit Agreement.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity\nposition to meet our daily cash flow needs, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment\nobjectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and current liabilities and access to alternative sources\nof funds. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, of $48.3 million and accounts receivable, contract receivables, and\nother receivables of $375.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Current liabilities, which totaled $768.8 million at period end as detailed in the table below,\nincluded $83.5 million in guarantees and letters of credit that are not expected to be settled in cash. Other sources of liquidity include amounts currently\navailable under our Revolving Credit Facility and expected future cash generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had amounts available\nunder our Revolving Credit Facility of up to approximately $41.4 million.\nManagement’s assessment of our liquidity is highly dependent on our ability to meet operating forecasts, including cash generated by operations,\nand manage working capital, including specifically the timely collection of outstanding contract receivables, which were $110.4 million at September 30,\n2024. During YTD 2024, we have faced a lengthened time interval between earning revenue and collecting receivables under outstanding contracts with\ncustomers due to complexities in\n44\nMedicare, Medicaid, and nongovernmental payor arrangements. This prolonged interval between fulfilling our performance obligations and collecting the\ncash owed for our services, which we have not historically experienced to this extent, has lengthened overall collection periods and increased the\nuncertainty concerning the timing of the collection of these outstanding contract receivables.\nAs of the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, Management determined that the extended collection\nperiods and uncertainty concerning the timing of the collection of outstanding contract receivables has changed our forecasts of our ability to meet certain\nfinancial covenants in our debt instruments, specifically related to our Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant in our amended Credit Agreement. As a result, it\nhas been determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to meet our obligations as they come due within one year from the date of issuance of\nthese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we continue to monitor cash generated from operations, available credit, and other liquid assets, sustaining operations relies heavily on the\ntimely collection of contract receivables and compliance with the Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant in our Credit Agreement, as amended to date. Failure\nto meet this covenant or others could cause our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility, and the Company’s Notes due 2029 to\nbecome immediately due and payable, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy such obligations. In such event, we would expect to be required\nto restructure our existing debt or seek additional equity or debt financing to meet our obligations and maintain our existence as a going concern.\nTo address our compliance with the financial covenants in our debt instruments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we entered into the\nFourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement on September 30, 2024. This amendment increased the maximum permitted Total Net Leverage Ratio under\nthe amended Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 to 6.50:1.00 from 5.25:1.00. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, we\nwere in compliance with all of our covenants under the Credit Agreement for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nManagement intends to undertake additional actions including continuing our discussions with our bank group on a collaborative long-term relief\namendment to support ongoing compliance with financial covenants and take other measures to further address these issues, support the funding of\noperations and improve liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that any long-term relief amendment or additional funds will be available when\nneeded on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations or sustain operations in the future.\nIn the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Our\nshort-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash\nflow from operations, debt financing, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information regarding our operating, investing\nand financing cash flows, see “Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements— Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,” included in Part I,\nItem I of this report.\nWe have cash requirements of $768.8 million due in one year or less in addition to $1,371.3 million due in more than one year as of September\n30, 2024. The following is a summary of our future cash requirements for the next twelve months and the period extending beyond twelve months as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n45\nAt September 30, 2024\nLess than Greater than\nTotal 1 Year 1 Year\nSenior Unsecured Notes(1) $ 500,000 $ — $ 500,000\nTerm Loan Facility(1) 523,688 5,250 518,438\nRevolving Credit Facility(1) 228,000 228,000 —\nInterest(2) 372,290 91,399 280,891\nContracts payable(3) 47,300 47,300 —\nTransportation costs(4) 95,023 95,023 —\nDeferred tax liabilities(5) 32,831 — 32,831\nOperating leases(6) 42,912 8,548 34,364\nGuarantees(7) 32,704 27,954 4,750\nLetters of credit(7) 55,556 55,556 —\nPurchased service commitment(8) 12,375 12,375 —\nOther current cash obligations(9) 197,398 197,398 —\nTotal $ 2,140,077 $ 768,803 $ 1,371,274\n(1) See Note 9 of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” for further\ndetail of our Senior Unsecured Notes, Term Loan Facility, and Revolving Credit Facility and the timing of expected future payments.\n(2) Interest payments on our Senior Unsecured Notes are typically paid semi-annually in arrears and have been calculated at the rates fixed as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Interest payments on our Term Loan Facility are typically paid quarterly in arrears and have been calculated at the SOFR-\nbased benchmark plus the applicable margin of 4.75% as of September 30, 2024. Interest payments on our Revolving Credit Facility have been\ncalculated by taking the expected borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility for the next year at the weighted average interest rate of borrowings\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 of 9.3%.\n(3) See Note 4 of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” for further\ndetail of our contracts payable.\n(4) See Note 1 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of\nour Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 26, 2024 for further detail of our accrued transportation cost.\n(5) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial\nreporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\n(6) The operating leases are for office space. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. See Note 15 of the\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of our Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 26, 2024 for further detail of our operating leases.\n(7) Letters of credit (“LOCs”) are guarantees of potential payments to third parties under certain conditions. Guarantees include surety bonds we\nprovide to certain customers to protect against potential non-delivery of our non-emergency transportation services. Our LOCs shown in the table\nwere provided by our Revolving Credit Facility and reduced our availability under the related Credit Agreement. The surety bonds and LOC\namounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period.\n(8) The purchased service commitment includes the maximum penalty we would incur if we do not meet our minimum volume commitment over the\nremaining term of the agreement under certain contracts. See Note 17 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 26, 2024 for\nfurther detail of our purchased service commitment.\n(9) These include other current liabilities reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, including\naccounts payable and accrued expenses as detailed at Note 8 of the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included\nin Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements”.\nOur primary sources of funding include operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility and access to\ncapital markets. In addition, there are statutory, regulatory, and debt covenant limitations that affect our ability to access the capital market for funds.\nManagement believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. Management continuously monitors\nour liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Except as disclosed herein, our\nmanagement is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In\n46\naddition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect\non us.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial\ncondition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Refer to Note 2,\n“Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1\nof this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the significant\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our\ncritical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk mainly related to our Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility, which have variable interest\nrates that may increase. We had a combined $233.3 million of short-term debt outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and\n$55.6 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. Interest rates on the outstanding principal amount\nof the Revolving Credit Facility vary and accrue at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted Daily\nSimple SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA Rate, as applicable and each as defined in the Credit Agreement, in\neach case, plus an applicable margin. Interest rates on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility vary and accrue at a per annum rate\nequal to the SOFR-based benchmark, a prime rate, or other alternate base rate, as applicable and each as defined in the amended Credit Agreement, in each\ncase plus an applicable margin. We completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis with the assumption that the short-term borrowing amount that was\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 was outstanding for the fiscal year with an assumed one-percentage point increase in interest rates. Based on this\nanalysis, the one-percentage point increase would have an approximate $2.3 million negative impact on our pre-tax earnings.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,\nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange\nAct as of September 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, to the\nextent of the material weaknesses identified in internal control over financial reporting as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and\nfinancial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn light of the material weaknesses described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management\nperformed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accordingly, management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting\nThe Company, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is in the process of ongoing remediation efforts related to the\nmaterial weaknesses previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, management began executing on the newly designed internal controls and supporting\nprocesses to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting at the Company's PCS segment as described in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The remediation plan put into place by management includes working with an independent third-\nparty internal control specialist to lead the remediation efforts as well as the addition of resources within the organization to improve structure and help\nmitigate\n47\nrisks previously identified. The approach to the remediation plan is uniform and enterprise-wide to eliminate future enterprise risk and strengthen the\nCompany's overall internal control over financial reporting. Key focus areas have been identified as general information technology control (GITC)\ndeficiencies, namely change management controls and logical access controls, and process-level controls activities in the Company's revenue processes\nand payroll processes within the PCS segment.\nTo that effect, the Company has:\n• Successfully brought the remaining PCS business unit onto an existing payroll system, creating standard systems, processes, and controls\nrelated to payroll across the PCS segment;\n• Successfully brought the remaining PCS business unit onto the existing PCS revenue and billing system, creating standard systems,\nprocesses, and controls related to revenue and billing across the PCS segment;\n• Executed on test of design for newly designed controls and processes in payroll and revenue.\nThe Company's management continues to focus on projects that automate, standardize, and centralize the Company's control environment as it\ncontinues to integrate the PCS segment. Management believes that the remediation measures described above will address the material weaknesses and\nstrengthen the Company's overall internal control over financial reporting. Management will continue to monitor the progress of these efforts, and may\ntake additional measures or modify the remediation plan described above in order to effectively address the control deficiencies. The material weaknesses\nwill not be considered remediated until the remediated controls have operated for a sufficient amount of time for management to conclude, through testing,\nthat the controls are designed and operating effectively.\n(c) Limitations on the effectiveness of controls\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\nstatement preparation and presentation. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls\nmust be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may\noccur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company conducts periodic\nevaluations of its internal controls to enhance, where necessary, its procedures and controls.\n48\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time-to-time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We record accruals for\noutstanding legal matters when it is believed to be probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management,\nfollowing consultation with legal counsel, does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of any such ongoing or anticipated matters to\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. We cannot predict with certainty, however, the potential for or\noutcome of any litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material\nadverse impact on us due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as\ndamages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Interested parties should refer to Note 13,\nCommitments and Contingencies, in this report for information concerning other potential contingent liabilities matters that do not rise to the level of\nmateriality for purposes of disclosure hereunder.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual\nReport”) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and could cause the trading price of our common\nstock to decline. The discussion of the risks included under that caption in our Annual Report remains current in all material respects, and there have been\nno material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report, except as otherwise set forth below:\nSubstantial doubt exists about our ability to meet our obligations as they come due within one year from the date of issuance of the financial\nstatements included within this report, the existence of which may have a material adverse effect on our stock price, our ability to raise capital or enter\ninto strategic transactions, and our relationships with key stakeholders.\nAs discussed in Note 1, Management's Liquidity Plans and Going Concern Considerations, to the unaudited financial statements included in this\nreport, and under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity” in this report, the\nCompany has faced a lengthened time interval between earning revenue and collecting receivables under outstanding contracts with some of its customers\ndue to complexities in Medicare, Medicaid, and nongovernmental payor arrangements. This prolonged interval between the Company fulfilling its\nperformance obligations and collecting the cash owed for its services from its customers has lengthened collection periods and increased the uncertainty\nconcerning the timing of the collection of these corresponding outstanding contract receivables. The extended collection periods and uncertainty\nconcerning the timing of the collection of outstanding contract receivables has changed the Company’s forecasts of, among other things, its ability to meet\nthe Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant in its amended Credit Agreement. Any failure to maintain compliance with such financial or\nother covenant could cause the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Company’s Notes due 2029 to become immediately due and\npayable, and the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy such obligations. As a result, it has been determined that substantial doubt exists\nabout the Company’s ability to meet its obligations as they come due within one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this\nreport.\nThe Company is analyzing various alternatives to support ongoing compliance with financial covenants and the continued funding of operations\nand to improve liquidity, including continuing discussions with the Company’s bank group on a collaborative long-term relief amendment with respect to\nthe Company’s financial covenants. There can be no assurance, however, that any long-term relief amendment, additional funds or strategic transactions\nwill be available when needed on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, or in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to satisfy its obligations or\nsustain operations in the future. In addition, if the Company issues equity to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior\nto those of the Company’s common stock, and the Company’s current stockholders may experience dilution.\nFurthermore, as a result of the determination itself that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to meet its obligations as they come\ndue within one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this report, there may be material adverse impacts to the Company’s\nstock price, the Company’s ability to raise capital or enter into strategic transactions on terms acceptable to the Company or at all, or the Company’s\nrelationships with its key stakeholders. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient, timely financial resources and improve liquidity, its business, results\nof operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Any of these adverse impacts could result in a significant or\ncomplete loss of your investment.\n49\nThe risk factors discussed by us do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known\nto us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may\nnot be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n50\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written\nplan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement.”\n51\nItem 6.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall\nbe construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 825 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial\nAccounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at “fair\nvalue”, as defined therein and (ii) any treatment of Indebtedness under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 or 2015-03 (or any other\nAccounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a\nreduced or bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount\nthereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.04(a) or in the definition of “Capital Lease Obligations,” any\nchange in accounting for leases pursuant to GAAP resulting from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting\nStandards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“FAS 842”), to the extent such adoption would require treating any lease (or similar\narrangement conveying the right to use) as a capital lease or a financing lease where such lease (or similar arrangement) would not have\nbeen required to be so treated under GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2015, such lease shall not be considered a capital lease or a\nfinancing lease, and all calculations and deliverables under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made or delivered, as\napplicable, in accordance therewith.\n(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, financial ratios and tests, including the Interest Coverage Ratio,\nSecured Net Leverage Ratio and Total Net Leverage Ratio shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this Section 1.04(b); provided that\nnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.04(b)(ii), (iii) or (iv), when calculating the Total Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of\nthe definition of “Applicable Rate”, and when calculating the Interest Coverage Ratio and Total Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of\ndetermining actual compliance (and not pro forma compliance or compliance on a pro forma basis) with any covenant set forth in Section\n6.12, the events described in this Section 1.04(b) that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period shall not be given pro\nforma effect. In addition, whenever a financial ratio or test is to be calculated on a pro forma basis, the reference to the “Test Period” for\npurposes of calculating such financial ratio or test shall be deemed to be a reference to, and shall be based on, the most recently ended Test\nPeriod.\n(i)\n(ii) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio or test, Specified Transactions (with any incurrence or repayment of any\nIndebtedness in connection therewith to be subject to Section 1.04(b)(iv)) that have been made (1) during the applicable Test Period and (2)\nif applicable as described in Section 1.04(b)(i), subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the\ncalculation of any such ratio is made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase\nor decrease in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had\noccurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period. If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently\nbecame a Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries since the beginning of\nsuch Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.04(b), then such\nfinancial ratio\n59\nor test (or the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA) shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this Section\n1.04(b).\n(iii) Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good\nfaith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower and include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of cost savings,\noperating expense reductions, other operating improvements and cost synergies either (1) projected by the Borrower in good faith to be\nreasonably anticipated to be realizable within twenty-four (24) months of the date thereof or (2) determined on a basis consistent with Article\n11 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange Act and as interpreted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or\nany successor agency), in each case in accordance with (and without duplication of, and subject to the limitations set forth in) clause (xv) of\nthe definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, other\noperating improvements and cost synergies had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense\nreductions, other operating improvements and cost synergies were realized during the entirety of such period), and any such adjustments\nshall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests and during any subsequent Test Period in which the\neffects thereof are expected to be realized relating to such Specified Transaction.\n(iv) In the event that the Borrower or any Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including\nby redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test (in each\ncase, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility), (1) during the applicable Test Period or (2) subject to\nSection 1.04(b)(i) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation\nof any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or repayment of\nIndebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period.\n(v) Any provision requiring the pro forma compliance with Section 6.12 shall be made assuming that compliance with the\nInterest Coverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or minimum Liquidity, as applicable, pursuant to such Section is required with respect\nto the most recent Test Period or fiscal quarter-end, as applicable, prior to such time.\n(vi) If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such\nIndebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking\ninto account any Swap Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness).\nSECTION 1.05. Interest Rates; Benchmark Notification. The interest rate on a Loan denominated in Dollars or an\nAlternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the\nsubject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.14(b) provides a mechanism for determining\nan alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability\nwith respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with\nrespect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or\ncharacteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic\nequivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its\ndiscontinuance or unavailability. The\n60\nAdministrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate\nused in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant\nadjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services\nin its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition\nthereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or\nentity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses\n(whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof)\nprovided by any such information source or service.\nSECTION 1.06. Status of Obligations. In the event that the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall at any time issue or\nhave outstanding any Subordinated Indebtedness, the Borrower shall take or cause such other Loan Party to take all such actions as shall be\nnecessary to cause the Secured Obligations to constitute senior indebtedness (however denominated) in respect of such Subordinated\nIndebtedness and to enable the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to have and exercise any payment blockage or other remedies available\nor potentially available to holders of senior indebtedness under the terms of such Subordinated Indebtedness. Without limiting the foregoing,\nthe Secured Obligations are hereby designated as “senior indebtedness” and as “designated senior indebtedness” and words of similar import\nunder and in respect of any indenture or other agreement or instrument under which such Subordinated Indebtedness is outstanding and are\nfurther given all such other designations as shall be required under the terms of any such Subordinated Indebtedness in order that the Lenders\nmay have and exercise any payment blockage or other remedies available or potentially available to holders of senior indebtedness under the\nterms of such Subordinated Indebtedness.\nSECTION 1.07. Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time\nshall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit available to be drawn at such time; provided that,\nwith respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Letter of Credit Agreement related thereto, provides for one or more\nautomatic increases in the available amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the\nmaximum amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum amount is available to be\ndrawn at such time.\nSECTION 1.08. Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of\ndivision under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of\nany Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the\noriginal Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been\norganized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.\nSECTION 1.09. Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents.\n(a) The Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Dollar Equivalent amounts\nof Term Benchmark Borrowings or RFR Borrowings or Letter of Credit extensions denominated in Alternative Currencies. Such Dollar\nEquivalent shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such amounts until the next Revaluation\nDate to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by the Borrower hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder\nor except as otherwise provided herein, the\n61\napplicable amount of any Agreed Currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount\nas so determined by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable.\n(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Term\nBenchmark Loan or an RFR Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or\nmultiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such\namount shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being\nrounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be.\nSECTION 1.10. Limited Condition Transactions. As it relates to any action being taken solely or primarily in connection\nwith a Limited Condition Acquisition, for purposes of:\n(a) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or\nfinancial test (other than actual (and not pro forma) compliance with Section 6.12 or in the case of any determination under Section 4.02\nwith respect to obligation of each Revolving Lender to make a Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, or of\nthe Issuing Banks to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit),\n(b) testing availability under baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets determined by reference to\nConsolidated EBITDA) or,\n(c) testing whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred or would result therefrom (other than for any determination\nunder Section 4.02 with respect to obligation of each Revolving Lender to make a Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan on the occasion of any\nBorrowing, or of the Issuing Banks to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit),\nin each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition\nAcquisition, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, any such provision is\ncomplied with, any such tested availability is sufficient, and any such Default or Event of Default exists, in each case, shall be deemed to be\nthe date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving effect\nto the Limited Condition Acquisition on a pro forma basis (and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith, including\nany incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, as if they had occurred on the first day of the most recently ended Test\nPeriod prior to the LCT Test Date), the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary would have been permitted to take such action on the relevant\nLCT Test Date in compliance with such provision, ratio, test or basket, such provision, ratio, test or basket shall be deemed to have been\ncomplied with or if no such Default or Event of Default shall exist on such LCT Test Date and no Specified Event of Default shall exist on\nthe date of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, then such condition shall be deemed satisfied on the date of consummation\nof such Limited Condition Acquisition; provided, that, if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal periods shall have become\navailable, the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial\nstatements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, if the Borrower has made an LCT Election and any of the provisions, ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or\ntested as of the LCT Test Date would have failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such provision, ratio, test or\nbasket,\n62\nincluding due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition or at or\nprior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such\nLimited Condition Acquisition, such provisions, baskets, tests or ratios or requirement will not be deemed to have failed to have been\ncomplied with as a result of such circumstance; however, if any provisions or ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such\nfluctuations, such improved provisions, ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited\nCondition Acquisition, then in connection with any calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability with respect to any transaction\npermitted hereunder (each, a “Subsequent Transaction”) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earliest of the date on which\nsuch Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated, the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is\nterminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or the 120th day following the signing of the definitive\nagreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition, for purposes of determining whether such Subsequent Transaction is permitted under this\nAgreement, any such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis (i) assuming such Limited Condition\nAcquisition and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have\nbeen consummated and (ii) solely in the case of a Subsequent Transaction constituting a Restricted Payment, assuming such Limited\nCondition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds\nthereof) have not been consummated.\nSECTION 1.11. Amendment No. 3 Effective Date Reallocations. The parties to this Agreement agree that, on the\nAmendment No. 3 Effective Date: (a) the “Revolving Commitments” (as defined in this Agreement immediately prior to the Amendment\nNo. 3 Effective Date) shall be allocated between, and redesignated as, 2027 Revolving Commitments and 2028 Revolving Commitments\nhereunder and (b) the Administrative Agent shall make such other reallocations, sales, assignments or other relevant actions in respect of\neach Lender’s credit and loan exposure under the this Agreement immediately prior to the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date as are necessary\nin order that each such Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure hereunder reflects such Lender’s 2027 Applicable Percentage or 2028\nApplicable Percentage, as applicable, of the outstanding aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure on the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date.\nARTICLE II\nThe Credits\nSECTION 2.01.

Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its\nobligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by\nany circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and\nthat each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever; provided that on the 2027\nMaturity Date, the participations so acquired by the 2027 Revolving Lenders shall be reallocated to the 2028 Revolving Lenders ratably in\naccordance with such 2028 Revolving Lenders’ respective Applicable Percentages determined after giving effect to the termination of the\n2027 Revolving Commitments (provided that, to the extent such reallocation shall cause the total 2028 Revolving Credit Exposures to\nexceed the 2028 Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall, on such date of reallocation, prepay 2028 Revolving Loans and/or cash\ncollateralize outstanding LC Exposure in an amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess). Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its\nobligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect\nto Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the\nAdministrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The\nAdministrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and\nthereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any\namounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after\nreceipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent;\nany such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders\nthat shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any\nsuch payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such\npayment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this\nparagraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.\n(c) The Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative\nAgent, the replaced Swingline Lender and the successor Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of\nany such replacement of the Swingline Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid\ninterest accrued for the account of the replaced Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.13(a). From and after the effective date of any such\nreplacement, (i) the successor Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this\nAgreement with respect to Swingline Loans made thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Swingline Lender” shall be deemed to\nrefer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor and all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall\nrequire. After the replacement of a Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced Swingline Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall\ncontinue to have all the\n67\nrights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans made by it prior to its replacement, but\nshall not be required to make additional Swingline Loans.\n(d) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Swingline Lender, the Swingline Lender may resign as a\nSwingline Lender at any time upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Revolving\nLenders, in which case, such Swingline Lender shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(d) above.\nSECTION 2.06. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may\nrequest any Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Agreed Currencies as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its\nSubsidiaries’ obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Bank, at any time and from\ntime to time during the 2028 Availability Period; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of twenty (20) Letters of\nCredit outstanding.

In addition, as a condition to any such Letter of Credit issuance, the Borrower\nshall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a\nletter of credit application, in each case, as required by the relevant Issuing Bank and using the relevant Issuing Bank’s standard form (each,\na “Letter of Credit Agreement”). In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and\nconditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,\namended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent\nand warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (i) the amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed\n$60,000,000, (ii)(x) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank at such time plus (y) the\naggregate amount of all LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank that have not yet been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower at\nsuch time (such sum for any Issuing Bank at any time of determination, its “Outstanding LC Amount”) shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s\nLetter of Credit Commitment) (provided that, notwithstanding this clause (ii) but at all times subject to the immediately preceding clause (i)\nand the immediately succeeding clauses (iii) and (iv), an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue, amend or extend a Letter of\nCredit if such issuance, amendment or extension would cause such Issuing Bank’s Outstanding LC Amount to exceed its Letter of Credit\nCommitment, (iii) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the total Letter of Credit Commitments, (iv) (x) no 2027 Revolving Lender’s 2027\nRevolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its 2027 Revolving Commitment and the total 2027 Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed\nthe sum of the total 2027 Revolving Commitments, (y) no 2028 Revolving Lender’s 2028 Revolving Credit\n68\nExposure shall exceed its 2028 Revolving Commitment and the total 2028 Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the sum of the total\n2028 Revolving Commitments and (z) no Revolving Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed its Revolving Commitment and the\nTotal Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed aggregate Revolving Commitments and (v) (x) the total 2027 Revolving Credit Exposures\nin Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the 2027 Alternative Currency Sublimit, (y) the total 2028 Revolving Credit Exposures in\nAlternative Currencies shall not exceed the 2028 Alternative Currency Sublimit and (z) the Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders in\nAlternative Currencies shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the\nLetter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank with the consent of such Issuing Bank; provided that the Borrower shall not reduce the\nLetter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank if, after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in the immediately\npreceding clauses (i) through (iv) shall not be satisfied.\nNo Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if:\n(i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin\nor restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain\nfrom issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank shall prohibit the issuance,\namendment or extension of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or\nlaw shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital or liquidity\nrequirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall\nimpose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the Effective Date and that such\nIssuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; or\n(ii) the issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such\nIssuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.\n(b) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the relevant Issuing\nBank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such\nLetter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, one year after such extension) and (ii) the date that is five\n(5) Business Days prior to the 2028 Maturity Date; provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may contain customary\nautomatic extension provisions agreed upon by the Borrower and the Issuing Bank that provide for the extension thereof for additional one-\nyear periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referenced in clause (ii) above), subject to a right on the part of the Issuing\nBank to prevent any such extension from occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary in advance of any such extension.\n(c) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or\nextending the expiration date thereof) and without any further action on the part of any Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, each Issuing\nBank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from each Issuing Bank, a participation in such\nLetter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit;\nprovided that on the 2027 Maturity Date, the participations so granted and acquired by the 2027 Revolving Lenders shall be reallocated to\nthe 2028 Revolving Lenders\n69\nratably in accordance with the 2028 Revolving Lenders’ respective Applicable Percentages determined after giving effect to the termination\nof the 2027 Commitments (provided that, to the extent such reallocation shall cause the total 2028 Revolving Credit Exposures to exceed the\n2028 Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall, on such date of reallocation, prepay 2028 Revolving Loans and/or cash collateralize\noutstanding LC Exposure in an amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess). In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each\nRevolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing\nBank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on\nthe date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any\nreason, including after the Maturity Date. Each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction\nwhatsoever. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in\nrespect of Letters of Credit and to make payments in respect of such acquired participations are absolute and unconditional and shall not be\naffected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance\nof a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments.\n(d) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower\nshall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount in the currency of such LC Disbursement equal to\nsuch LC Disbursement, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the\nBorrower receives such notice; provided that, (x) if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Dollars, the Borrower may, subject to the\nconditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR\nRevolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement or (y) if such LC Disbursement is denominated\nin an Alternative Currency, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section\n2.03 that such payment be converted into an equivalent amount of an ABR Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars in an amount equal\nto the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency, and, in each case, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such\npayment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable. If the Borrower fails\nto make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the\npayment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such\nnotice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower,\nin the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis,\nto the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the\namounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the\nBorrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the relevant Issuing Bank or, to the extent\nthat Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such\nIssuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing\nBank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not\nconstitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Borrower’s reimbursement\nof, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Alternative Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any\nLender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be\nmade in Dollars, the Borrower shall, at its option, either\n70\n(x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse\neach LC Disbursement made in such Alternative Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated on the\ndate such LC Disbursement is made.\n(e) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this\nSection shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement\nunder any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of\nCredit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of\nCredit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any\npayment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of\nsuch Letter of Credit, (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the\nprovisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations\nhereunder or (v) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrower\nor any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing\nBank, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or\ntransfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred\nto in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, document, notice or\nother communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in\ninterpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant Issuing\nBank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct\ndamages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower\nto the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when\ndetermining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto\nexpressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the\nforegoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face\nto be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make\npayment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or\nrefuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of\nCredit.\n(f) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the specific terms of\nthe Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of\nCredit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed\nby telecopy or electronic mail) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement\nthereunder; provided that such notice need not be given prior to payment by such Issuing Bank and any failure to give or delay in giving\nsuch notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any\nsuch LC Disbursement.\n71\n(g) Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such\nLC Disbursement in full in the applicable currency on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest,\nfor each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due and payable,\nat the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such\nreimbursement is payable; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of\nthis Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank,\nexcept that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse\nsuch Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.\n(h) Replacement and Resignation of an Issuing Bank. (A) Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written\nagreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative\nAgent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become\neffective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and\nafter the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank\nunder this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be\ndeemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall\nrequire. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have\nall the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it\nprior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of\nCredit.\n(B) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an\nIssuing Bank at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders, in\nwhich case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.06(i)(A) above.\n(i) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower\nreceives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving\nLenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this\nparagraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account or accounts with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and\nfor the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the “Collateral Account”), an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure in the applicable\ncurrencies as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall\nbecome effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,\nupon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or 7.01(i). The Borrower also shall\ndeposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11. Such deposit shall be held by the\nAdministrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. In addition,\nand without limiting the foregoing or Section 2.06(c), if any LC Exposure remains outstanding after the expiration date specified in Section\n2.06(c), the Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of such LC Exposure as of\nsuch date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Administrative Agent shall\n72\nhave exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account and the Borrower hereby grants the\nAdministrative Agent a security interest in the Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which\ninvestments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense, such\ndeposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account\nshall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been\nreimbursed, together with related fees, costs and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the\nsatisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been\naccelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be\napplied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the\noccurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3)\nBusiness Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral\nhereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(a), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the\nextent that, immediately after giving effect to such return, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Revolving\nCommitments, and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.\n(j) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding\nhereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the “account party,” “applicant,”\n“customer,” “instructing party,” or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the relevant Issuing\nBank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the Borrower (i)\nshall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all\ndrawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and\nall defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of\nsuch Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit\nof the Borrower, and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.\n(k) Issuing Bank Agreements. Each Issuing Bank agrees that, unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent,\nsuch Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank\nexpects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment or extension, and the aggregate face amount\nand currency of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance,\namendment or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank pays\nany amount in respect of one or more drawings under Letters of Credit, the date of such payment(s) and the amount of such payment(s), (iii)\non any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse any amount required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the\ndate of such failure and the amount and currency of such payment in respect of Letters of Credit and (iv) on any other Business Day, such\nother information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.\nSECTION 2.07. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the\nproposed date thereof solely by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time (or in the case of an ABR\nBorrowing, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time), to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such\npurpose by\n73\nnotice to the Lenders; provided that (i) Term Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.01(c) and (ii) Swingline Loans shall be made as\nprovided in Section 2.05. Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the\nAdministrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account\nof the Administrative Agent to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by\nthe Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC\nDisbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Issuing Bank.\n(a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing\n(or in the case of an ABR Borrowing, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not\nmake available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender\nhas made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption,\nmake available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable\nBorrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative\nAgent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made\navailable to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of\nthe applicable Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans or in the case of Alternative Currencies, in\naccordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such\namount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.\nSECTION 2.08. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and Agreed Currency specified in the\napplicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such\nBorrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in\nthe case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect\ndifferent options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably\namong the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a\nseparate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.\n(a) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by\nthe time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting\nfrom such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be\nsigned by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower; provided that, if such Interest Election Request is submitted through an Approved\nBorrower Portal, the foregoing signature requirement may be waived at the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent.\n74\n(b) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:\n(i) the Agreed Currency and the principal amount of the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if\ndifferent options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting\nBorrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting\nBorrowing);\n(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;\n(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing (in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars) or a\nTerm Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing; and\n(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving\neffect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.\nIf any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall\nbe deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Borrower be permitted to request pursuant to this Section 2.08(c), a CBR Loan or, prior\nto a Benchmark Transition Event and Benchmark Replacement Date with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, an RFR Loan bearing interest\nbased on Daily Simple SOFR (it being understood and agreed that a Central Bank Rate and Daily Simple SOFR shall only apply to the\nextent provided in Section 2.08(e) (solely with respect to the Central Bank Rate), 2.14(a) and 2.14(f)), as applicable.\n(c) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the\ndetails thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.\n(d) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing in\nDollars prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such\nInterest Period such Borrowing shall be deemed to have an Interest Period that is the same as the immediately preceding Interest Period. If\nthe Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing in an Alternative\nCurrency prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Term Benchmark Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, the\nBorrower shall be deemed to have selected that such Term Benchmark Borrowing shall automatically be continued as a Term Benchmark\nBorrowing in its original Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month at the end of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any\ncontrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required\nLenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or\ncontinued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, (x) (A) each Term Benchmark Borrowing\ndenominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) each RFR\nBorrowing\n75\ndenominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing immediately and (y) each Term Benchmark Borrowing and each RFR\nBorrowing, in each case denominated in an Alternative Currency shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed\nCurrency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding\nabsent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term\nBenchmark Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall either be (A) converted to an ABR Borrowing denominated\nin Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) at the end of the Interest Period, as applicable, therefor\nor (B) prepaid at the end of the applicable Interest Period, as applicable, in full; provided that if no election is made by the Borrower by the\nearlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest\nPeriod for the applicable Term Benchmark Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (A) above.\nSECTION 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated (i) the Term Loan\nCommitments shall terminate upon the making of the Term Loans on the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date, (ii) the 2027 Revolving\nCommitments shall terminate on the 2027 Maturity Date, (iii) the 2028 Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the 2028 Maturity Date\nand (iv) all other Commitments shall terminate on the applicable Maturity Date.\n(a) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments of any Class;\nprovided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000\nand not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments of any Class if, after giving\neffect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, (A) the Dollar Equivalent of any Lender’s Revolving\nCredit Exposure would exceed its Revolving Commitment, (B) the Dollar Equivalent of any 2027 Revolving Lender’s 2027 Revolving\nCredit Exposure would exceed its 2027 Revolving Commitment, (C) the Dollar Equivalent of any 2028 Revolving Lender’s 2028 Revolving\nCredit Exposure would exceed its 2028 Revolving Commitment or (D) the Dollar Equivalent of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would\nexceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments.\n(b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments of any\nClass under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,\nspecifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the\nLenders of the applicable Class of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;\nprovided that a notice of termination of the Commitments of any Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned\nupon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the\nBorrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination\nor reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably\namong the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class.\nSECTION 2.10.

In such event, the Borrower shall\nprepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and\nits registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and\ninterest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in\nsuch form.\n(f) The Subsidiary Guarantors are co-obligors for all purposes under this Agreement and fully liable for all Obligations\nunder this Agreement.\nSECTION 2.11.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the\nAdministrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that\nwould be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a\nRevolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing, each voluntary prepayment of a\nTerm Loan Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Term Loans included in the prepaid Term Loan Borrowing in such order of application\nas directed by the Borrower (and in the absence of such direction, in direct order of maturity), and each mandatory prepayment of a Term\nLoan Borrowing shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.11(e).

provided further that to the extent of any such Sweep\nAmount therefrom that has not been so applied by the end of such 365-day period (or committed to be applied by the end of the 365-day\nperiod and applied within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period), then a prepayment shall be required at such time in an amount\nequal to such Sweep Amount that has not been so applied.\n(d) The Borrower shall prepay the Obligations on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i) the date on\nwhich the Borrower’s annual audited financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2025) are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 or (ii) the date on which such annual audited financial statements were required\nto be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01, in an amount equal to (A) the ECF Percentage of the Borrower’s Excess Cash Flow for such\nimmediately preceding fiscal year, less (B) at the Borrower’s option, any optional prepayment of Indebtedness under the Loan Documents in\naccordance with Section 2.11(a) during such preceding fiscal year or (without duplication) after the end of such preceding fiscal year and\nprior to the such Excess Cash Flow prepayment date (excluding (i) any such optional prepayments made during such preceding fiscal year\nthat reduced the amount required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) in the prior fiscal year and (ii) any such optional prepayments\nof revolving Indebtedness except to the extent any related commitment is permanently reduced in connection with such repayment);\nprovided, that no prepayment under this Section 2.11(d) shall be required unless the amount thereof would exceed $3,000,000 (and in which\ncase only the amount in excess of $3,000,000 shall be required to be prepaid). As used herein, “ECF Percentage” means (w) seventy-five\npercent (75%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 4.40 to 1.00, (x) fifty percent (50%) if the\nTotal Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.90 to 1.00 but less than or equal to 4.40 to 1.00, (y) twenty-five\npercent (25%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.40 to 1.00 but less than or equal to 3.90 to\n1.00, and (z) zero percent (0%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was less than or equal to 3.40 to 1.00. Each\nExcess Cash Flow prepayment shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by a Financial Officer certifying in reasonable detail the manner\nin which Excess Cash Flow and the resulting prepayment were calculated.\n79\n(e) All such amounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(c) and (d) shall be applied to installments of the Term Loans as directed by\nthe Borrower (and in the absence of such direction, in direct order of maturity). Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or\nprovided in, or intended with respect to, any Incremental Amendment (provided, that such Incremental Amendment may not, without the\nconsent of the requisite Lenders in accordance with Section 9.02, provide that the applicable Class of Term Loans receive a greater than pro\nrata portion of mandatory prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or (d) than would otherwise be permitted by this\nAgreement), in each case effectuated or issued in a manner consistent with this Agreement, each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to\nSection 2.11(c) or (d) shall be allocated ratably to the Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans (if any) then outstanding.\n(f) With respect to any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or (d), unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable Incremental Amendment, any Term Lender, at its option, may elect not to accept such prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the\nAdministrative Agent of any event giving rise to a prepayment under Section 2.11(c) or (d) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date\nof such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount\nof such prepayment that is required to be made under this Section 2.11(c) or (d).

If the\nLender does not give a notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such second Business Day informing the Administrative Agent that\nit declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed to have accepted such prepayment. Such Lender’s Retained\nDeclined Proceeds may be retained by the Borrower and thereafter shall not be subject to any prepayment obligation under Section 2.11(c)\nor (d).\n(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.11(c) or (d), to the extent any or all of the Net Proceeds of any\nPrepayment Event by any Foreign Subsidiary of the Borrower, the Net Proceeds of such Prepayment Event received by such Subsidiary or\nExcess Cash Flow attributable to such Subsidiary, are prohibited or delayed by any applicable local law (including financial assistance,\ncorporate benefit restrictions on upstreaming of cash intra group and the fiduciary and statutory duties of the directors of such Subsidiary)\nfrom being repatriated or passed on to or used for the benefit of the Borrower or any applicable Domestic Subsidiary of the Borrower or if\nthe Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any such amount to the Borrower or any such applicable Domestic Subsidiary\nwould have material adverse tax consequences (including a material acceleration of the point in time when such earnings would otherwise be\ntaxed) with respect to such amount, the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to\nprepay the Term Loans at the times provided in Section 2.11(c) or (d) but may be retained by the applicable Subsidiary so long, but only so\nlong, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation or the passing on to or otherwise using for the benefit of the Borrower or the\napplicable Domestic Subsidiary, or the Borrower believes in good faith that such material adverse tax consequence would result, and once\nsuch repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law or the Borrower\ndetermines in good faith such repatriation would no longer have such material adverse tax consequences, such repatriation will be promptly\neffected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days\nafter such repatriation) applied (net of taxes payable or reasonably estimated to be payable as a result thereof) to the prepayment of the Term\nLoans pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or (d) (provided that no such prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or (d) shall be\nrequired in the case of any such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow the repatriation of which the Borrower believes in good faith would\nresult in\n80\nmaterial adverse tax consequences, if on or before the date on which such Net Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been required to\nbe applied to reinvestments or prepayments (or such Excess Cash Flow would have been so required if it were Net Proceeds), the Borrower\napplies an amount equal to the amount of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net\nProceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would\nhave been payable or reserved against if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Proceeds or Excess\nCash Flow that would be calculated if received by such Subsidiary)).\n(h) All (i) prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.11(c) effected on or prior to the six-month\nanniversary of the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date with the proceeds of a Repricing Transaction and (ii) amendments, amendments and\nrestatements or other modifications of this Agreement on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date\nconstituting Repricing Transactions in respect of any Term Loans shall, in each case, be accompanied by a fee payable to the appliable Term\nLenders in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so prepaid, in the case of a transaction described\nin clause (i) of this paragraph, or 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans affected by such amendment, amendment and\nrestatement or other modification (including any such Term Loans assigned as part of such amendment, amendment and restatement or other\nmodification in connection with the replacement of a Term Lender not consenting thereto), in the case of a transaction described in clause (ii)\nof this paragraph. Such fee shall be paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Term Lenders in\nrespect of the applicable Term Loans, on the date of such prepayment or amendment.\nSECTION 2.12.

and\n(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including\nthose contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the\nAdministrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower\nor the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)\n(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent\nas may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to\ndetermine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct\nand withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to\nFATCA after the date of this Agreement.\nEach Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect,\nit shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do\nso.\n(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received\na refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts\npursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity\npayments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including\nTaxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to\nsuch refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid\nover pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the\nevent that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\nin this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this\nparagraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party\nwould have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise\nimposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be\nconstrued to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems\nconfidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.\n91\n(g) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the\nAdministrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the\nrepayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.\n(h) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “Lender” includes the Issuing Banks and the term\n“applicable law” includes FATCA.\nSECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Allocations of Proceeds; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.\n(a) (i) Except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower\nshall make each payment or prepayment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement\nof LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) in Dollars prior to 12:00 noon, New\nYork City time, on the date when due or the date fixed for any prepayment hereunder and (ii) all payments with respect to principal\nand interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made in such Alternative Currency not later than the\nApplicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein, in each case in immediately available funds,\nwithout set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the\nAdministrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest\nthereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made and (ii) to the\nAdministrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event\ndenominated in an Alternative Currency, the Administrative Agent’s Term Benchmark Payment Office for such currency, except\npayments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments\npursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall\ndistribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate\nrecipient promptly following receipt thereof. Subject to the proviso in the definition of Interest Period, if any payment hereunder\nshall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in\nthe case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Alternative Currency, currency control or\nexchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the\nCredit Event was made (the “Original Currency”) no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the\nAdministrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower\nhereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of\nrepayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any\nsuch currency control or exchange regulations.\n(b) At any time that payments are not required to be applied in the manner required by Section 7.03, if at any time\ninsufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC\nDisbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then\ndue hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with\n92\nthe amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC\nDisbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and\nunreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.\n(c) If, except as expressly provided herein, any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or\notherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or\nSwingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and\nparticipations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other\nLender of the same Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in\nthe Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit\nof all such payments shall be shared by all such Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued\ninterest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such\nparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be\nrescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph\nshall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this\nAgreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans\nor participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any\nSubsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and\nagrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the\nforegoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as\nfully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.\n(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, prior to any date on which any payment is due to the\nAdministrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders or the relevant Issuing Banks pursuant to the terms hereof or any other\nLoan Document (including any date that is fixed for prepayment by notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant\nto Section 2.11(b)), notice from the Borrower that the Borrower will not make such payment or prepayment, the Administrative\nAgent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such\nassumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders or the relevant Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the\nBorrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the relevant Lenders or the relevant Issuing Banks, as the case may be,\nseverally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank\nwith interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment\nto the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate.\nSECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under\nSection 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different\nlending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its\n93\noffices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts\npayable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost\nor expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and\nexpenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.\n(a) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes\nor additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any\nLender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the\nAdministrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions\ncontained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations\nunder this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another\nLender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the\nAdministrative Agent (and if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall\nnot unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding\nprincipal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all\nother amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the\nBorrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under\nSection 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or\npayments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender\nor otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees\nthat (i) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the\nBorrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and\nAssumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are\nparticipants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective\nand shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such\nassignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as\nreasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties\nthereto.\nSECTION 2.20. Incremental Facilities.\n(a) The Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions after the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date pursuant to an\nIncremental Amendment (i) add one or more new Classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the Term Loans of any\nexisting Class by requesting new commitments to provide such Term Loans (any such new Class or increase, an “Incremental Term Facility”\nand any loan made pursuant to any Incremental Term Facility, an “Incremental Term Loan”) and/or (ii) increase the aggregate amount of the\n2028 Revolving Commitments (an “Incremental Revolving Facility” and, together with any Incremental Term Facility, “Incremental\nFacilities”; and the loans thereunder, “Incremental Revolving Loans” and any Incremental Revolving Loans, together with any Incremental\nTerm Loans, “Incremental Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Maximum Expansion Amount; provided that\n94\n(i) no Incremental Commitment in respect of any Incremental Term Facility may be in an amount that is less than\n$5,000,000 (or such lesser amount to which the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree),\n(ii) except as the Borrower and any Lender may separately agree, no Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental\nCommitment, and the determination to provide any Incremental Commitment shall be within the sole and absolute discretion of such\nLender,\n(iii) no Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan (nor the creation, provision or implementation thereof) shall require the\napproval of any existing Lender other than in its capacity, if any, as a lender providing all or part of any Incremental Commitment or\nIncremental Loan,\n(iv) except as otherwise permitted herein (including with respect to margin, pricing (including any MFN provision),\nmaturity, Weighted Average Life to Maturity and fees), the terms of any Incremental Term Facility will not be materially more\nrestrictive (when taken as a whole) on the Borrower than the existing applicable Credit Facilities (except for terms (x) applicable\nonly to periods after the latest Maturity Date with respect to the Term Loan Facility or (y) that are concomitantly added for the\nbenefit of the existing applicable Credit Facilities) or to the extent that such terms are not consistent with the foregoing, such terms\nmust be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent,\n(v) the All-In Yield (and the components thereof) applicable to any Incremental Facility shall be determined by the\nBorrower and the lender or lenders providing such Incremental Facility; provided that the All-In Yield applicable to any Incremental\nTerm Facility incurred or established prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date may\nnot be more than 0.50% per annum higher than the All-In Yield applicable to the then-existing Term Loans unless the Applicable\nRate (and/or, as provided in the proviso below, the Alternate Base Rate floor or Floor) with respect to such Term Loans is adjusted\nsuch that the All-In Yield on such Term Loans is not more than 0.50% per annum less than the All-In Yield with respect to such\nIncremental Facility; provided, further, that any increase in All-In Yield applicable to any Term Loan due to the application or\nimposition of an Alternate Base Rate floor or Floor on any such Incremental Term Loan may, at the election of the Borrower, be\neffected through an increase in the Alternate Base Rate floor or Floor applicable to such Term Loan,\n(vi) the final maturity date with respect to any Class of Incremental Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date;\nprovided that this clause (vi) shall not apply to any bridge financing converting to, or intended to be refinanced by, Indebtedness\ncomplying with this clause (vi) and clause (vii) below,\n(vii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Incremental Term Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining\nWeighted Average Life to Maturity of any then-existing tranche of Term Loans (without giving effect to any prepayment thereof);\nprovided that this clause (vii) shall not apply to any bridge financing converting to, or intended to be refinanced by, Indebtedness\ncomplying with this clause (vii) and clause (vi) above,\n95\n(viii) subject to clauses (vi) and (vii) above, any Incremental Term Facility may otherwise have an amortization schedule\nas determined by the applicable Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility,\n(ix) subject to clause (v) above, to the extent applicable, any fees payable in connection with any Incremental Facility shall\nbe determined by the applicable Borrower and the arrangers and/or lenders providing such Incremental Facility,\n(x) (A) each Incremental Term Facility or Incremental Revolving Facility shall rank pari passu with the Term Loans and\nRevolving Loans in right of payment and security and (B) no Incremental Facility may be (x) guaranteed by any Person which is not\na Loan Party or (y) secured by any assets other than the Collateral,\n(xi) (A) no Default or Event of Default shall exist immediately prior to or after giving effect to such Incremental Facility\n(provided, that, notwithstanding and in lieu of the foregoing, if the Borrower shall have made an LCT Election in accordance with\nSection 1.08, no Default or Event of Default shall existing immediately prior to the LCT Test Date and no Specified Event of\nDefault shall exist immediately prior to or after giving effect to such Incremental Facility), and (B) the representations and\nwarranties of the Loan Parties (or, if agreed to by the lenders thereof, customary “SunGard” representations and warranties) set forth\nin this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or if qualified by materiality or\nMaterial Adverse Effect, in all respects) on and as of the date such Incremental Facility becomes effective with the same effect as\nthough such representations and warranties had been made on and as of such date; provided that to the extent that any representation\nand warranty specifically refers to a given date or period, it shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or for\nsuch period,\n(xii) any Incremental Term Facility shall participate (A) in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in Section\n2.11(a) and (B) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.11(c) and (d), in each case, to the extent\nprovided in such Sections,\n(xiii) the proceeds of any Incremental Facility may be used for working capital and/or purchase price adjustments and\nother general corporate purposes and any other use not prohibited by this Agreement, and\n(xiv) on the date of the Borrowing of any Incremental Term Loans that will be of the same Class as any then-existing Class\nof Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.08 or 2.13, such Incremental Term Loans shall\nbe added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Borrower, have the same Interest Period as)\neach Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that\neach Term Lender providing such Incremental Term Loans will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of\nTerm Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the application of this clause (a)(xiv) may result in new Incremental Term\nLoans having an Interest Period (the duration of which may be less than one month) that begins during an Interest Period then\napplicable to outstanding Term Benchmark Loans of the relevant Class and which ends on the last day of such Interest Period.\n(b) Incremental Commitments may be provided by any existing Lender, or by any other eligible assignee (any such other\nlender being called an “Incremental Lender”); provided that the\n96\nAdministrative Agent (and, in the case of any Incremental Revolving Facility, the Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank) shall have a right\nto consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the relevant Incremental Lender’s provision of Incremental\nCommitments if such consent would be required under Section 9.04 for an assignment of Loans to such Incremental Lender, mutatis\nmutandis, to the same extent as if the relevant Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been acquired by such Lender by way\nof assignment.\n(c) Each Lender or Incremental Lender providing a portion of any Incremental Commitment shall execute and deliver to\nthe Administrative Agent and the Borrower all such documentation (including the relevant Incremental Amendment) as may be reasonably\nrequired by the Administrative Agent to evidence and effectuate such Incremental Commitment. On the effective date of such Incremental\nCommitment, each Incremental Lender shall become a Lender for all purposes in connection with this Agreement.\n(d) As conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Incremental Facility or the making of any Incremental Loans, (i)\nupon its reasonable request, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive customary written opinions of counsel, as well as such\nreaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments as it shall reasonably require, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to\nreceive, from each Incremental Lender, an Administrative Questionnaire and such other documents as it shall reasonably require from such\nIncremental Lender, (iii) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Incremental Lenders, or the Incremental Lenders, as applicable, shall\nhave received the amount of any fees payable to the Incremental Lenders in respect of such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans, (iv)\nsubject to Section 2.20(h), the Administrative Agent shall have received a Borrowing Request as if the relevant Incremental Loans were\nsubject to Section 2.03 or another written request the form of which is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (it being\nunderstood and agreed that the requirement to deliver a Borrowing Request shall not result in the imposition of any additional condition\nprecedent to the availability of the relevant Incremental Loans) and (v) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive a certificate of\nthe Borrower signed by a Financial Officer thereof (A) certifying and attaching a copy of the resolutions adopted by the governing body of\nthe Borrower approving or consenting to such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans and (B) to the extent applicable, certifying that the\ncondition set forth in clause (a)(xi) above has been satisfied.\n(e) Upon the implementation of any Incremental Revolving Facility pursuant to this Section 2.20:\n(i) each 2028 Revolving Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed\nto have assigned to each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender, and each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender\nwill automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed a portion of such 2028 Revolving Lender’s participations\nhereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans such that, after giving effect to each deemed assignment and\nassumption of participations, all of the 2028 Revolving Lenders’ (including each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender) (A)\nparticipations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (B) participations hereunder in Swingline Loans shall be held on a pro rata basis on\nthe basis of their respective 2028 Revolving Commitments (after giving effect to any increase in the 2028 Revolving Commitment\npursuant to this Section 2.20);

it being understood and agreed that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements\ncontained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this clause (ii).\n(f) On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Facility, the maximum amount of LC Exposure and/or\nSwingline Loans, as applicable, permitted hereunder shall increase by an amount, if any, agreed upon by the Borrower, the Administrative\nAgent and the relevant Issuing Bank and/or the Swingline Lender, as applicable.\n(g) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Incremental Amendment and/or\nany amendment to any other Loan Document as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or\ncommitments pursuant to this Section 2.20, such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the\nAdministrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms\nconsistent with this Section 2.20 and such other amendments as are described in Section 9.02.\n(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20 or in any other provision of any Loan Document, if the\nproceeds of any Incremental Facility are intended to be applied to finance a Permitted Acquisition or other similar Investment and the\nlenders providing such Incremental Facility so agree, the availability thereof shall be subject to customary “SunGard” or “certain funds”\nconditionality.\n(i) This Section 2.20 shall supersede any provision in Section 2.18 or Section 9.02 to the contrary.\nSECTION 2.21.

The Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public\nsale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so\nsold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Loan Party, which right or equity is hereby waived and released by the Borrower on\nbehalf of itself and its Subsidiaries. The Borrower further agrees on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, at the Administrative Agent’s\nrequest, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall\nreasonably select, whether at the premises of the Borrower, another Loan Party or elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net\nproceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Article VII, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in\nconnection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any other way relating to the Collateral or the\nrights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, to the payment in\nwhole or in part of the Secured Obligations, in such order as set forth in Section 7.03, and only after such application and after the payment\nby the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York Uniform\nCommercial Code, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Loan Party. To the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw, the Borrower on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries waives all Liabilities it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender\narising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be\nrequired by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.\nSECTION 7.03.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE\nAGENT, ANY ARRANGER, ANY CO-SYNDICATION AGENT, ANY CO-DOCUMENTATION AGENT OR ANY OF THEIR\nRESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, “APPLICABLE PARTIES”) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOAN PARTY,\nANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING\nDIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN\nTORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN PARTY’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S\nTRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.\n(d) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that\nCommunications have been posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such\nLender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing\n(which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or each Issuing Bank’s (as applicable) email\naddress to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email\naddress.\n(e) Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Banks and the Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except\nas may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in\naccordance with the Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document retention procedures and policies.\n(f) Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to give any notice\nor other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.\nSECTION 8.04. The Administrative Agent Individually. With respect to its Commitments, Letter of Credit Commitments,\nLoans (including Swingline Loans) and Letters of Credit, the Person serving as the Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise the\nsame rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other\nLender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be. The terms “Issuing Banks”, “Lenders”, “Required Lenders”, “Required Revolving Lenders” and\nany similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a\nLender, an Issuing Bank or as one of the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable.

Successor Administrative Agent.\n(a) The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior written notice thereof to the Lenders, the\nIssuing Banks and the Borrower, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed. Upon any such resignation, the\nRequired Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so\nappointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s\ngiving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a\nsuccessor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any such bank. In either case,\nsuch appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and shall\nnot be required while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent\nby a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers,\nprivileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor\nAdministrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the\nother Loan Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the retiring\nAdministrative Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Administrative Agent its rights as\nAdministrative Agent under the Loan Documents.\n(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so\nappointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to\nresign, the retiring Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the\nBorrower, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be\ndischarged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that, solely for purposes of maintaining\nany security interest granted to the Administrative Agent under any Collateral Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring\nAdministrative Agent shall continue to be vested with such security interest as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and\ncontinue to be entitled to the rights set forth in such Collateral Document and Loan Document, and, in the case of any Collateral in the\npossession of the Administrative Agent, shall continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until such time as a successor Administrative\nAgent is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this Section (it being understood and agreed that the retiring\nAdministrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any further action under any Collateral Document, including any action\nrequired to maintain the perfection of any such security interest) and (ii) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all\nthe rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent; provided that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder\nor under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be\nmade directly to such Person and (B) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the\nAdministrative Agent shall directly be given or made to each Lender and each Issuing Bank. Following the effectiveness of the\nAdministrative Agent’s resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory,\nreimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any\n148\nother Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective\nRelated Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as\nAdministrative Agent and in respect of the matters referred to in the proviso under clause (i) above.\nSECTION 8.06. Acknowledgements of Lenders and Issuing Banks.\n(a) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a\ncommercial lending facility, (ii) in participating as a Lender, it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in\nproviding other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in each case in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, and not for the purpose of investing in the general performance or operations of the Borrower, or for the purpose of purchasing,\nacquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument such as a security (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees not to assert a\nclaim in contravention of the foregoing, such as a claim under federal or state securities law), (iii) it has, independently and without reliance\nupon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Co-Syndication Agent, any Co-Documentation Agent or any other Lender or the Issuing\nBank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,\nmade its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder and (iv) it\nis sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as\nmay be applicable to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make,\nacquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such\ncommercial loans or providing such other facilities. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and\nwithout reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Co-Syndication Agent, any Co-Documentation Agent or any other Lender\nor the Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information (which may contain\nmaterial, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it\nshall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this\nAgreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.\n(b) Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Effective Date, or delivering its signature page\nto an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to\nhave acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or\nbe approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Effective Date.\n(c)\n(i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative\nAgent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its\nAffiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a\n“Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such\nPayment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day thereafter (or such later\ndate as the Administrative Agent, may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return to the Administrative Agent the amount of\nany such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made\n149\nin same day funds, together with interest thereon (except to the extent waived in writing by the Administrative Agent) in respect of\neach day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is\nrepaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in\naccordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or\nright of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any\nPayments received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of the\nAdministrative Agent to any Lender under this Section 8.06(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.\n(ii) Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its\nAffiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the\nAdministrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or\naccompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such\nPayment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have\nbeen sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the\nAdministrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day thereafter (or such later date as the\nAdministrative Agent, may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such\nPayment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon (except to the\nextent waived in writing by the Administrative Agent) in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion\nthereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB\nRate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from\ntime to time in effect.\n(iii) The Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion\nthereof) are not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative\nAgent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay,\nprepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations (or any other Secured Obligations) owed by the Borrower or any other\nLoan Party.\n(iv) Each party’s obligations under this Section 8.06(c) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the\nAdministrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the\nCommitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.\nSECTION 8.07. Collateral Matters.\n(a) Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights in accordance with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Secured Party’s\nright to file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the\nCollateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Secured Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under\nthe Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured\n150\nParties in accordance with the terms thereof. In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a “representative” of the Secured Parties within the\nmeaning of the term “secured party” as defined in the UCC. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral\nsecurity for the Secured Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and\ndeliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor\nof the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its\ndiscretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) as described in Section 9.02(d); (ii) as\npermitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing\nby the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative\nAgent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release particular types or items of Collateral\npursuant hereto. Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document,\nor consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior\nwritten request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the\nLenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent for the\nbenefit of the Secured Parties herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the\nAdministrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Administrative Agent’s reasonable opinion,\nwould expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens\nwithout recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or any Liens\nupon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by any Loan Party, including (without limitation) the proceeds of\nthe sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. Any execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent of\ndocuments in connection with any such release shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.\n(b) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no Banking Services Agreement or Swap Agreement will\ncreate (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or release\nof any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each\nSecured Party that is a party to any such Banking Services Agreement or Swap Agreement, as applicable, shall be deemed to have appointed\nthe Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the\nLoan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.\n(c) The Secured Parties irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to subordinate\nany Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such\nproperty that is permitted by Section 6.02(b). The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into\nany representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the\nAdministrative Agent’s Lien thereon or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative\nAgent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.\nSECTION 8.08. Credit Bidding. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the\ndirection of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the\nCollateral in satisfaction of some or all of\n151\nthe Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one\nor more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy\nCode, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan\nParty is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the\ndirection of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with\nany such credit bid and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the\nAdministrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to contingent or\nunliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims\nin an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or\nassets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with\nsuch purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles\nand to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Secured\nObligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or\nvehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the\ngovernance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition\nvehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the\ngoverning documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this\nAgreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination\nof this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this\nAgreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the\nSecured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Secured Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership\ninterests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such\nacquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that\nSecured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid\nbeing higher or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Secured\nObligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Secured Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured\nParties pro rata with their original interest in such Secured Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any\nacquisition vehicle on account of such Secured Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any\nacquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party are\ndeemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and\nprovide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt\ninstruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any\nacquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.\nSECTION 8.09.

Manager” (within the\nmeaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such\nLender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,\n(C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the

Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any\nLender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single\nor partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any\nother or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing\nBanks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that\nthey would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in\nany event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective\nonly in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or\nissuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender\nor any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.\n(a) Except as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment or as provided in Section\n2.14(b) and Section 2.14(c), neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an\nagreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent\nwith the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the\nwritten consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or\nreduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (except that none of (A) any\namendment or modification of the Financial Covenants (or defined terms used in the Financial Covenants) or (B) the waiver or reduction of\nany obligation of the Borrower to pay interest or fees at the applicable default rate set forth in Section 2.13(c) shall constitute a reduction in\nthe rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (ii)), (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan\nor LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon (other than interest payable at the applicable default rate set forth in Section 2.13(c)), or any fees\npayable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any\nCommitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.09(c) or 2.18(b) or (c) in a\n156\nmanner that would alter the ratable reduction of Commitments or the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written\nconsent of each Lender, (v) change the payment waterfall provisions of Section 2.21(b) or 7.03 without the written consent of each Lender,\n(vi) [reserved], (vii) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof\nspecifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or\ngrant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties\nprescribed by Section 2.20 to be parties to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the\ndetermination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments and the Loans are included on the Effective Date),\n(viii) (A) release the Borrower from its obligations under Article X or (B) release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from\ntheir obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender, or (ix) except as provided in\nclause (d) of this Section or in any Collateral Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the written consent of each\nLender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent,\nany Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the\nSwingline Lender, as the case may be (it being understood that any change to Section 2.21 shall require the consent of the Administrative\nAgent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender); and provided further that no such agreement shall amend or modify the provisions of\nSection 2.06 without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\nconsent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except\nwith respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and\nthen only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and\nrestated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (x) to add one or more credit facilities\n(in addition to the Incremental Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit\nfrom time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this\nAgreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Loans, the initial Term Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued\ninterest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the\nRequired Lenders and Lenders (it being understood and agreed that any such amendment in connection with new or increases to the\nCommitments and/or Incremental Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.20 shall require solely the consent of the parties prescribed by\nsuch Section and shall not require the consent of the Required Lenders).\n(c) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release\nany Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral (i) upon the satisfaction of the Final Release Conditions,\n(ii) upon the termination of all the Commitments, payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Secured Obligations (other than Swap\nObligations not yet due and payable, Banking Services Obligations not yet due and payable, Unliquidated Obligations for which no claim\nhas been made and other Obligations expressly stated to survive such payment and termination), and the cash collateralization of all\nUnliquidated Obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (iii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if the\nBorrower certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the\nAdministrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iv) constituting property leased to the\nBorrower or any Subsidiary under a lease\n157\nwhich has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, or (v) as required to effect any sale or other\ndisposition of such Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article\nVII. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Secured Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly\nbeing released) upon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any\nsale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral (except to the extent any of the foregoing constitutes Excluded Assets). In\naddition, each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties, irrevocably authorizes the Administrative\nAgent, at its option and in its discretion, (i) to subordinate any Lien on any assets granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any\nLoan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) or (ii) in the event that the Borrower shall\nhave advised the Administrative Agent that, notwithstanding the use by the Borrower of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the\nconsent of such holder (but without the requirement to pay any sums to obtain such consent) to permit the Administrative Agent to retain its\nliens (on a subordinated basis as contemplated by clause (i) above), the holder of such other Indebtedness requires, as a condition to the\nextension of such credit, that the Liens on such assets granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document be released,\nto release the Administrative Agent’s Liens on such assets.\n(d) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “each Lender” or “each\nLender directly affected thereby,” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained\n(any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a “Non-Consenting Lender”), then the Borrower\nmay elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement,\n(i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to\npurchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to\nbecome a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of\nsuch date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in\nsame day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting\nLender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-\nConsenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender\non the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold\nto the replacement Lender and (iii) such Non-Consenting Lender shall have received the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and\nparticipations in LC Disbursements. Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected\npursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent\napplicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to\nwhich the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party\nthereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided\nthat, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents\nnecessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without\nrecourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower or\nother applicable Loan Parties only, amend, modify or supplement this\n158\nAgreement or any of the other Loan Documents (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency or correct any\ntypographical error or other manifest error in any Loan Document, (ii) to comply with local law or advice of local counsel in any jurisdiction\nthe laws of which govern any Collateral Document or that are relevant to the creation, perfection, protection and/or priority of any Lien in\nfavor of the Administrative Agent or (iii) to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in\nany Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties.\nSECTION 9.03. Expenses; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity, Etc.\n(a) Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the\nAdministrative Agent and the Arrangers (which shall be limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented\nfees, disbursements and other charges of a single firm as primary counsel, along with such specialist counsel as may reasonably be required\nby the Administrative Agent, and a single firm of local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), in connection with the syndication and\ndistribution (including, without limitation, via the internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the credit facilities provided for herein,\nthe preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications\nor waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all\nreasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment or extension\nof any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\nthe Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (which shall be limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable\nand documented fees, disbursements and other charges of a single firm as primary counsel to all such parties, along with such specialist\ncounsel as may reasonably be required by the Administrative Agent, and a single firm of local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, for the\nAdministrative Agent, and, in the event of an actual or reasonably perceived conflict of interest (as reasonably determined by the\nAdministrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank or Lender), one additional firm of primary counsel for each group of similarly affected\npersons, and to the extent required, one firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting\nin multiple jurisdictions)) in connection with the enforcement, collection or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and\nany other Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued\nhereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses (subject to the foregoing limitations with respect to legal fees and expenses) incurred\nduring any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.\n(b) Limitation of Liability.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does\nnot comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such\nrights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.\n(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a\ncopy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the\nLenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each\nLender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive (absent\nmanifest error), and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name\nis recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding\nnotice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any\nreasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.\n(v) Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee\nor (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved\nElectronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, the\nassignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and\nrecordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of\nthis Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in\nthe Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made\nby it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(d), the Administrative Agent shall have no\n163\nobligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such\npayment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such\nLender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this\nAgreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree\nto any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees\nthat each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein,\nincluding the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be\ndelivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to\nparagraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were\nan assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17, with\nrespect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive\na greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells\na participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the\nprovisions of Section 2.19(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the\nbenefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a\nLender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a\nregister on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s\ninterest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any\nobligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a\nParticipant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except\nto the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered\nform under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or Section 1.163-5(b) of the Proposed United States Treasury\nRegulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest\nerror, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all\npurposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity\nas Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n164\n(c) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement\nto secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central\nbanking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security\ninterest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or\nsubstitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n(d) Disqualified Institutions.\n(i) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade\nDate”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign or grant a participation in all or a portion\nof its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower has consented to such assignment or\nparticipation in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution\nfor the purpose of such assignment or participation). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee or Participant that\nbecomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a written supplement to the\nlist of “Disqualified Institutions” referred to in, the definition of “Disqualified Institution”), (x) such assignee or Participant shall not\nretroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender or Participant and (y) the execution by the Borrower of an Assignment and\nAssumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified\nInstitution. Any assignment or participation in violation of this clause (e)(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause\n(e) shall apply.\n(ii) If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrower’s prior written consent\nin violation of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Borrower\nmay, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, require such\nDisqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.04),\nall of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Persons (other than an Ineligible Institution, the\nBorrower, any of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates) at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof\nand (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations in each case plus accrued\ninterest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.\n(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions to whom an\nassignment or participation is made in violation of clause (i) above (A) will not have the right to (x) receive information, reports or\nother materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in\nmeetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or\nconfidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for\npurposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to\nthe Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any\nother Loan Document, each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are\nnot\n165\nDisqualified Institutions consented to such matter and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization, each Disqualified\nInstitution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such plan of reorganization, (2) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on\nsuch plan of reorganization notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good\nfaith and shall be “designated” pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other applicable\nlaws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such plan of\nreorganization in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other applicable laws)\nand (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent\njurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).\n(iv) The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative\nAgent, to (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time\n(collectively, the “DQ List”) on an Approved Electronic Platform, including that portion of such Approved Electronic Platform that\nis designated for “public side” Lenders and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender or potential Lender requesting the same.\n(v) The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to\nascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions. Without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor\nor inquire as to whether any other Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution or (y) have\nany liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, by\nany other Person to any Disqualified Institution.\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Lender may assign all or a portion of its\nTerm Loans to any Purchasing Borrower Party in accordance with this Section 9.04(f) (which assignment shall not constitute a prepayment\nof Loans for any purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents); provided that:\n(i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom,\n(ii) such assignment shall be made pursuant to (i) a bona fide open market purchase on a non-pro rata basis for cash\nconsideration or (ii) an Auction Purchase Offer open to all Lenders of the applicable Class conducted in accordance with the Auction\nProcedures;\n(iii) any Term Loans assigned to any Purchasing Borrower Party shall, without further action by any Person, be\nautomatically and permanently cancelled for all purposes and no longer outstanding (and may not be resold by any Purchasing\nBorrower Party), it being understood and agreed that any gains or losses by any Purchasing Borrower Party upon purchase or\nacquisition and cancellation of such Term Loans shall not be taken into account in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow,\nConsolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA;\n(iv) in no event shall any Purchasing Borrower Party be entitled to vote hereunder in connection with the assigned Term\nLoans;\n166\n(v) no more than one (1) Auction Purchase Offer with respect to any Class may be ongoing at any one time, no more than\nfour (4) Auction Purchase Offers (regardless of Class) may be made in any one year and any Auction Purchase Offer with respect to\nany Class shall be offered to all Term Lenders holding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis;\n(vi) no Purchasing Borrower Party may use the proceeds from Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans to purchase any Term\nLoans; and\n(vii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans of the applicable Class shall be deemed reduced by the\nfull par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans purchased pursuant to this Section 9.04(f) and each principal\nrepayment installment with respect to the Term Loans of such Class shall be reduced pro rata by the aggregate principal amount of\nTerm Loans purchased; provided that any such assignment shall not constitute a voluntary or mandatory prepayment for any other\npurpose under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.\nIn connection with any Term Loans assigned and cancelled pursuant to this Section 9.04(f), the Administrative Agent is authorized to make\nappropriate entries in the Register to reflect any such cancellation. Any payment made by any Purchasing Borrower Party in connection with\nan assignment permitted by this Section 9.04(f) shall not be subject to any of the pro rata payment or sharing requirements of this\nAgreement.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Administrative Agent shall not (a) be required to serve as the auction agent\nfor, or have any other obligations to participate in (other than mechanical administrative duties), or to facilitate any, Dutch auction unless it is\nreasonably satisfied with the terms and restrictions of such auction or (b) have any obligation to participate in, arrange, sell or otherwise\nfacilitate, and will have no liability in connection with, any open market purchases by the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

With respect to any securities and/or financial instruments so held by any Credit\nParty or any of its customers, all rights in respect of such securities and financial instruments, including any voting rights, will be exercised\nby the holder of the rights, in its sole discretion.\n(c) In addition, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Subsidiaries’ understanding, that each Credit\nParty and its Affiliates may be providing debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial advisory services) to other\ncompanies in respect of which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have conflicting interests regarding the transactions described\nherein and otherwise. No Credit Party will use confidential information obtained from the Borrower by virtue of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Loan Documents or its other relationships with the Borrower in connection with the performance by such Credit Party\nof services for other companies, and no Credit Party will furnish any such information to other companies. The Borrower also acknowledges\nthat no Credit Party has any obligation to use in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, or to furnish to the\nBorrower or any of its Subsidiaries, confidential information obtained from other companies.\nSECTION 9.18. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.

Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide\nsupport, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “QFC\nCredit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power\nof the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of\nsuch Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any\nSupported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of\nthe United States):\nIn the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a\nU.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and\nobligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such\nQFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special\nResolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were\ngoverned by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered\nParty becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might\notherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be\nexercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC\nand the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing,\nit is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of\nany Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.\nSECTION 9.20. Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a\nsum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in\naccordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the\nBusiness Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the\nAdministrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the\n“Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the\n175\n“Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such\nLender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the\ncase may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the\namount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the\nBorrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify\nthe Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is\ngreater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as\nthe case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under\napplicable law).\nSECTION 9.21.

The Borrower further agrees that if payment in respect of\nany Specified Ancillary Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York, Chicago\nor any other officer, branch, affiliate or correspondent bank of the applicable Lender for such currency and if, by reason of any Change in\nLaw, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Specified Ancillary\nObligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any applicable Lender (or any\nof its Affiliates), disadvantageous to such applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) in any material respect, then, at the election of such\napplicable Lender, the Borrower shall make payment of such Specified Ancillary Obligation in Dollars (based upon the Dollar Equivalent of\nsuch Specified Ancillary Obligation on the date of payment) and/or in New York, Chicago or such other payment office as is designated by\nsuch applicable Lender (or its Affiliate) and, as a separate and independent obligation, shall indemnify such applicable Lender (and any of its\nAffiliates) against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.\nUpon payment by the Borrower of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Borrower against any Subsidiary arising as\na result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior\nindefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Specified Ancillary Obligations owed by such Subsidiary to the applicable Lender (or its\napplicable Affiliates).\nThe Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may\nbe needed from time to time by each Subsidiary Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty in respect of\nSpecified Swap Obligations (provided, however, that the Borrower shall only be liable under this paragraph for the maximum amount of\nsuch liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this paragraph or otherwise under this Article X voidable\nunder applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).

These statements are predictive in nature and are frequently identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words indicating possible future\nexpectations, events or actions. The updated guidance discussed herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our business and our industry, and are not guarantees of our future performance. These statements are subject to a number of\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied herein, including but not limited to: government or private insurance program funding reductions or limitations;

and the effects of applicable anti-takeover provisions.\nThe Company has provided additional information about the foregoing and other risks facing our business in our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could impact future performance. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking\nstatements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth herein and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which you should read in their entirety before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. We undertake no obligation\nto update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the information contained herein may include presentations for the Company and its segments (as noted and applicable) of: (1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted G&A expense, Adjusted EBITDA margin,\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EPS, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures considered by management to be performance measures; and (2) free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure considered by management to be a liquidity measure. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before: (1) interest expense, net; (2) provision\n(benefit) for income taxes; and (3) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3) settlement related costs; (4) stock-based compensation; (5) equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax; (6) cash settled equity; (7) COVID-19\nrelated costs; (8) impairment of goodwill; (9) loss on extinguishment of debt; and (10) payor settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenue, net. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is calculated as net income (loss) before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3)\nsettlement related costs; (4) stock-based compensation; (5) equity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax; (6) intangible asset amortization expense; and (7) the income tax impact of such adjustments. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding as calculated\nfor Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Adjusted G&A expense is calculated as G&A expense before (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related costs; (2) transaction and integration costs; (3) settlement related costs; and (4) stock-based compensation. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operations less our applicable capital expenditures included in\nour purchase of property and equipment line in our Statements of Cash Flows.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures that are not included in the discussion above are included below. We do not provide guidance for net income (loss) in this presentation on a basis consistent with GAAP or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial\nmeasure (Adjusted EBITDA) to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (net income (loss)) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict items contained in the GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts. Our non-GAAP performance measures exclude expenses and amounts that are not driven by our core operating\nresults and may be one time in nature. Excluding these expenses makes comparisons with prior periods as well as to other companies in our industry more meaningful. We believe such measures allow investors to gain a better understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing operations of our business. We consider our core operations to be\nthe ongoing activities to provide services from which we earn revenue, including direct operating costs and indirect costs to support these activities. As a result, our net income or loss in equity investee is excluded from these measures, as we do not have the ability to manage the venture, allocate resources within the venture, or directly control its operations\nor performance. Our free cash flow presentation (as applicable) reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed together with our GAAP results, provides management, investors, and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Our use of the term free cash\nflow is not intended to imply, and no inference should be made, however, that any reported amounts are free to be used without restriction for discretionary expenditures, as our use of these funds may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, including our credit facility, and otherwise earmarked for other non-discretionary expenditures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with\nGAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n© 2024 Modivcare® Inc.\n2\nNational Tech-Enabled Platform with Market-Leading Solutions\nIntegrated Supportive Care Revenue Adj.
