(NASDAQ: MSGM) (“Motorsport Games” or “the Company”) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company has also posted the third quarter 2024 earnings slides highlighting key milestones that occurred during and subsequent to the period, which are accessible on the Company’s investor relations website.\n\n“The business has continued to take useful strides in Q3 2024 with further product updates, business streamlining and in the assessment of undertaking of the previously announced ‘strategic alternatives,’” remarked Stephen Hood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Motorsport Games.\n\n“Our second downloadable content (DLC) offering for Le Mans Ultimate completed the 2024 Hypercar grid whilst a free update to all players has enabled new gameplay opportunities that capture the spirit of Le Mans. An innovative co-op mode allows players to compete alongside their friends at a time convenient to them and save states have been added to the Race Weekend mode, adding a new dimension to the single player experience designed to enable more players to enjoy our offering in an increasingly busy market. Players can expect another major uplift in the game next month with the release of the first GT3 cars, a hotly requested content update available as a mix of DLC which includes a free car alongside new game functionality that is sure to further boost the vitality of what has been a strong opening 2024 for Le Mans Ultimate.”\n\nHood continued, “From a business perspective, the work to turn the business around has not stopped. We are pleased to see an improvement in several key financial performance indicators, highlighting that the business is now in a stable position for the next phase of growth. We recently announced that Motorsport Games is considering ‘strategic alternatives’ and the Motorsport Games board of directors and I are in the process of reviewing the options available to us with a view to improve our long-term funding needs in order to produce the great game experiences we have proved that we can offer under our new business structure. The number of expressions of interest received serves to reinforce our belief in the opportunities ahead.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Business Update_**\n\n●| Net income attributable to Motorsport Games Inc. of $0.01 million in Q3 2024 compared to a net loss of $3.6 million in Q3 2023, an improvement of $3.6 million.  \n---|---  \n●| Net income attributable to Class A common stock was $0.00 per share in Q3 2024, compared to a net loss per share of $1.31 in Q3 2023.  \n●| Released Le Mans Ultimate Innovative Co-op Game Mode, Save & Load System and 2024 Pack 2 DLC in September 2024.  \n●| Raised $1.0 million in gross proceeds from an RDO transaction in July 2024.  \n  \n**_Select Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.8 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.1 million, or 6.4%. Gross profit was $1.1 million compared to $0.9 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.2 million, while gross profit margin increased to 60.2% from 50.9%.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.6 million, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of $2.9 million. The decrease in net loss is driven by an increase in other income of $2.0 million, which is primarily comprised of foreign currency gains incurred remeasuring transactions denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Net loss also decreased due to a $0.5 million reduction in operating expenses related to headcount reductions and lower general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period, as well as a $0.2 million improvement in gross profit. Net income attributable to Class A common stock was $0.00 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $1.31 for the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.1 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) of $2.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) of $2.6 million was primarily due to the same factors driving the previously discussed change in net income for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year, as well as a decrease in stock-based compensation compared to the prior year period.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (loss)(1) for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended****September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \nNet loss| $| (573,025| )| $| (3,534,132| )  \nInterest expense, net| 29,852| 230,190  \nDepreciation and amortization (1)| 566,411| 501,399  \nEBITDA| 23,238| (2,802,543| )  \nLoss contingency expenses| -| 232,359  \nStock-based compensation| 26,889| 105,524  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 50,127| $| (2,464,660| )  \n  \n(1)| Includes $519,260 and $417,794 of amortization expenses included in cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Cash Flow and Liquidity_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.8 million, which decreased to $0.5 million as of October 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $0.7 million, representing an average monthly net cash burn from operations of approximately $0.1 million. While it has taken measures to reduce its costs, the Company expects to continue to have a net cash outflow from operations for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop its product portfolio and invest in developing new video game titles.\n\nBased on its cash and cash equivalents position and the average monthly cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company’s assets in addition to its recent sales of its NASCAR license and Traxion; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.\n\nThere can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional liquidity through the means referenced above, nor can there be any assurances that the Company can sufficiently reduce costs and restructure its business to sufficiently lower its cash burn to sustainable levels and therefore meet its ongoing cash requirements. Further, other factors can impact the Company’s liquidity position, including, but not limited to, the Company’s level of sales and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable, and accrued expenses. For additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity, see the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\n(1)**_Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (the “Non-GAAP Measure”) is not a financial measure defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Measure to net loss, its most directly comparable financial measure, calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are presented in the tables above.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance, is defined as EBITDA, which is net loss plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, less income tax benefit (if any), adjusted to exclude: (i) loss contingency expenses; and (ii) stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nThe Company uses the Non-GAAP Measure to manage its business and evaluate its financial performance, as Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that affect comparability between periods that the Company believes are not representative of its core ongoing operating business. Additionally, management believes that using the Non-GAAP Measure is useful to its investors because it enhances investors’ understanding and assessment of the Company’s normalized operating performance and facilitates comparisons to prior periods and its competitors’ results (who may define Adjusted EBITDA differently).\n\nThe Non-GAAP Measure is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to revenue, income/loss from operations, net (loss) income, or cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flows available for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements, such as interest payments, tax payments, working capital requirements and debt service requirements. The Non-GAAP Measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of using the Non-GAAP Measure by using it to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than would be presented by using only measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Non-GAAP Measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Details_**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET today, November 14, 2024, to discuss its financial results.
