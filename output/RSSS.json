(NASDAQ: RSSS), a trusted partner providing cloud-based workflow solutions to accelerate research for R&D-driven organizations, reported record financial results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Research Solutions, Inc. Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Research Solutions, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2464612/research_sol.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2464612/research_sol.html)\n\n**Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Summary (compared to prior-year quarter)**\n\n  * Total revenue of $12.1 million, a 22% increase.\n  * Platform revenue up 86% to $4.3 million. Platform revenue accounted for 35% of the revenue as compared to 23% in the prior year.\n  * Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") up 84% to $17.4 million, which includes approximately $12.1 million of B2B recurring revenue and $5.4M of B2C recurring revenue.\n  * Gross profit up 44%.

The quarter's result includes a charge of approximately $4.3 million related to increasing the projected earnout for Scite.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million, a 70% improvement and a Company quarterly record, compared to $825,000.\n  * Cash flow from operations of $2.0 million, compared to $1.5 million, a 30% improvement.\n\n\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Summary (compared to Fiscal 2023)**\n\n  * Total revenue of $44.6 million, an 18% increase.\n  * Platform revenue up 61% to $14.0 million. Transaction revenue increased 5.7% to $30.7 million.\n  * Gross profit up 34%.

We completed two acquisitions which helped position us as a vertical SaaS and AI company, helping researchers throughout their entire workflow. The integration of these acquisitions and our operational execution were meaningful contributors to our 85% year-over-year ARR growth and the double-digit increase in Adjusted EBITDA,\" said Roy W. Olivier, President and CEO of Research Solutions. \"There are many untapped market opportunities where our highly specialized product offerings can serve as a vital piece of the research process. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver meaningful ARR growth while expanding Adjusted EBITDA margins, creating long-term value for our shareholders.\" \n\n**Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $12.1 million, a 22% increase from $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter primarily driven by increased platform revenue versus the prior-year period due to revenue from the Company's acquisitions as well as organic platform revenue growth.\n\nPlatform subscription revenue for the quarter was $4.3 million, an 86% year-over-year increase. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Scite, as well as organic growth in the core Article Galaxy platform. The quarter ended with annual recurring revenue of $17.4 million, up 84% year-over-year (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\n\nTransaction revenue was $7.9 million, compared to $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The transaction active customer count for the quarter was 1,398, compared to 1,404 customers in the prior-year quarter (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\n\nTotal gross margin improved 710 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 46.5%. The increase was primarily driven by the continued revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business, as well as a 70 basis point increase in margins in the transactions business.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.0 million, compared to $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily related to the additional cost base associated with the aforementioned acquisitions, as well as increased non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to such acquisitions. \n\nOther expense for the quarter was approximately $3.5 million, compared to other income of $120,000 in the prior-year quarter. The primary driver of this was $4.3M of expense related to increasing the earn-out assumption associated with the Scite acquisition.\n\nNet loss in the fourth quarter was $2.8 million, or ($0.09) per diluted share, compared to net income of $376,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 million, compared to $825,000 in the year-ago quarter (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\n\n**Full-Year Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $44.6 million, an 18% increase from fiscal 2023, driven by both increased platform revenue and transaction revenue.\n\nPlatform subscription revenue for fiscal 2024 was $14.0 million, a 61% year-over-year increase. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Scite, as well as organic growth in the core Article Galaxy platform.\n\nTransaction revenue was $30.7 million, compared to $29.0 million in fiscal 2023. The increase was driven by organic growth and the impact of a full year of contribution from the acquisition of contracts from FIZ Karlsruhe, compared to six months in fiscal 2023.\n\nTotal gross margin improved 500 basis points from the prior-year to 44.0%. The increase was primarily driven by the continued revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business, as well as a 100 basis point increase in margins in the transactions business related to pricing initiatives.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the year were $20.4 million, compared to $14.5 million in fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily related to the additional cost base associated with the acquisitions, including increased non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to such acquisitions, as well as the aforementioned proxy and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nNet loss for fiscal 2024 was $3.8 million, or ($0.13) per diluted share, compared to net income of $572,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the prior-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 million, compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2023 (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\n\n**Conference Call** Research Solutions President and CEO Roy W.

The quantity of customers per month is defined as customers with at least one transaction during the month.\n\nA transaction is an order for a unit of copyrighted content fulfilled or managed in the Platform.\n\nThe company defines annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") as the value of contracted Platform subscription recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period. For B2C ARR, this includes the annualized value of monthly subscriptions, meaning their monthly value multiplied by twelve.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measure – Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nResearch Solutions' management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\n\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense) including any change in fair value of contingent earnout liability, foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise.

(NASDAQ: RSSS), a trusted partner providing cloud-based workflow solutions to accelerate research for R&D-driven organizations, reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Research Solutions, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo_v1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo_v1.html)\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Summary (compared to prior-year quarter)**\n\n  * Total revenue of $12.1 million, a 17% increase.\n  * Platform revenue up 76% to $4.0 million. Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") up 82% to $16.6 million, which includes approximately $11.7 million of B2B recurring revenue and $4.9M of B2C recurring revenue.\n  * Gross profit up 36%. Total gross margin improved 630 basis points to 45.2%.\n  * Net income of $76,000 or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $237,000 or $0.01 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $961,000, a Company quarterly record, compared to $559,000.\n  * Quarterly cash flow from operations of over $2 million, also a Company quarterly record, compared to $0.8 million. \n\n\n\n\"Our third quarter performance reflects the first full quarter of contribution from Scite and continued progress integrating Scite and ResoluteAI within our Article Galaxy platform. While we realized some anticipated churn in ResoluteAI ARR in the quarter, we experienced strong growth in both Scite B2B and B2C ARR, closing some large cross-sell opportunities with existing customers,\" said Roy W. Olivier, President and CEO of Research Solutions. \"During the quarter we launched two new product offerings, Technology Landscape and Clinical Trial Landscape, both of which harness our ability to simultaneously search across multiple datasets, extracting and synthesizing insights into use case specific outputs as part of our strategy to deliver workflows that save time for our customers. The highly specialized value proposition for our product offerings continues to grow as we serve as a critical piece of the research process, giving users the opportunity to effectively discover, acquire and manage the most relevant content all in one place. Overall, we believe our offerings and expanded addressable market will deliver meaningful growth and long-term value for our shareholders.\" \n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $12.1 million, a 17% increase from $10.3 million in the year-ago quarter primarily driven by increased platform revenue from the prior-year period which included a full quarter of revenue from the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and Scite.\n\nPlatform subscription revenue for the quarter was $4.0 million, a 76% year-over-year increase. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and Scite, as well as organic growth in the core Article Galaxy platform. The quarter ended with annual recurring revenue of $16.6 million, up 82% year-over-year (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\n\nTransaction revenue was $8.2 million, compared to $8.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This quarter represents the first comparable period following the acquisition of contracts from FIZ Karlsruhe, which was effective January 1, 2023. The transaction active customer count for the quarter was 1,426, compared to 1,417 customers in the prior-year quarter (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\n\nTotal gross margin improved 630 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 45.2%. The increase was primarily driven by the continued revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business, as well as a modest increase in margins in the transactions business.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.4 million, compared to $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily related to the additional expense base associated with the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and Scite. \n\nNet income in the third quarter was $76,000, or $0.00 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $237,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $961,000, compared to $559,000 in the year-ago quarter (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nResearch Solutions President and CEO Roy W.

The quantity of customers per month is defined as customers with at least one transaction during the month.\n\nA transaction is an order for a unit of copyrighted content fulfilled or managed in the Platform.\n\nThe company defines annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") as the value of contracted Platform subscription recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period. For B2C ARR, this includes the annualized value of monthly subscriptions, meaning their monthly value multiplied by twelve.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measure – Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nResearch Solutions' management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\n\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense), foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise. Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss):\n\n**Quarter Ended March 31,** | **Nine Months Ended March 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Change** | **% Change** | **2024** | **2023** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n**Net Income (loss)** | $ 76,301 | $ 236,842 | $ (160,541) | -67.8 % | $ (965,370) | $ 195,877 | $ (1,161,247) | NM  \nAdd (deduct): | -  \nOther income (expense) | (31,228) | (104,331) | 73,103 | -70.1 % | (547,965) | (218,095) | (329,870) | 151.3 %  \nForeign currency translation loss | 22,177 | (72,547) | 94,724 | NM | 15,059 | (84,210) | 99,269 | 117.9 %  \nProvision for income taxes | 42,590 | 628 | 41,962 | NM | 82,049 | 5,543 | 76,506 | NM  \nDepreciation and amortization | 309,898 | 18,332 | 291,566 | 1590.5 % | 525,267 | 30,486 | 494,781 | 1623.0 %  \nStock-based compensation | 541,002 | 480,458 | 60,544 | 12.6 % | 1,729,271 | 1,264,522 | 464,749 | 36.8 %  \nGain on sale of disc. ops. | - | - | - | - | - | -  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ 960,740 | $ 559,382 | $ 401,358 | 71.8 % | $ 838,311 | $ 1,194,123 | $ (355,812) | -29.8 %  \n  \n**About Research Solutions** Research Solutions, Inc.

(NASDAQ: RSSS), a trusted partner providing cloud-based workflow solutions to accelerate research for R&D-driven organizations, reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Research Solutions, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo.html)\n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Summary**\n\n  * Total revenue of $10.3 million, an 18.3% increase from the prior-year quarter\n  * Platform revenue up 48% to $3.1 million. Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") up 77% to $15.6 million, which includes approximately $4.0 million of B2C recurring revenue and $0.4M of B2B recurring revenue from the Scite, Inc. (\"Scite\") acquisition. B2C ARR is broken out on a separate line in the Company's Financial and Operational Summary Tables and for the purposes of calculating B2C ARR, the value of any monthly recurring subscriptions has been multiplied by twelve (see the Financial and Operational Summary Tables and associated notes below).\n  * Gross profit up 31.7% from the prior-year quarter. Total gross margin improved 450 basis points to 43.5%.\n  * Net loss of $54,000 or ($0.00) on a per share basis, compared to a net loss of ($256,000) or ($0.01) per share in the prior-year quarter. The quarter's loss includes $307,000 in expenses related to M&A activities, most of which were legal expenses.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $318,000 compared to $201,000 in the prior-year quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA result is inclusive of the expenses related to M&A activities noted above. Without these costs, Adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $625,000.\n  * The company closed its acquisition of Scite on December 1, 2023. The quarter's numbers include approximately one month of activity from Scite.\n\n\n\n\"Our second quarter results reflect the continued execution of our plan and with the acquisition of Scite our ARR is now approximately $15.6 million. We also experienced continued organic growth across our platform and transaction offerings, with net incremental ARR on the Article Galaxy platform being our best result in the last four quarters,\" said Roy W. Olivier, President and CEO of Research Solutions. \"In addition, we have greatly enhanced the offerings available within our Article Galaxy platform over the past six months with the addition of ResoluteAI and Scite. When combined with our existing products, these acquisitions add multiple new workflow and advanced search and discovery solutions that can be sold to new or existing customers. These new solutions materially increase our Total Addressable Market (\"TAM\") and as we further integrate the products together, we will be able to deliver unique value to our customers. Overall, we remain a critical piece of the research process and believe we are well-positioned to expand our user base as macroeconomic conditions improve.\" \n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $10.3 million, an 18% increase from $8.7 million in the year-ago quarter as both platform and transaction revenue increased from the prior-year period.\n\nPlatform subscription revenue increased 48% to $3.1 million compared to $2.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and Scite, as well as organic growth in the core Article Galaxy platform. The quarter ended with annual recurring revenue of $15.569 million, up 77% year-over-year, including approximately $4.355 million of ARR from Scite (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\n\nTransaction revenue was $7.2 million, compared to $6.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to organic growth, which was also enhanced by higher transaction volumes related to contracts transferred from FIZ Karlsruhe effective on January 1, 2023. The transaction customer count for the quarter was 1,398, compared to 1,223 customers in the prior-year quarter (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\n\nTotal gross margin improved 450 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 43.5%. The increase was primarily driven by the continued revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business, as well as increased margins in the transactions business.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $4.9 million, compared to $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily related to the additional expense base associated with the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and Scite. Additionally, this quarter's results include $307,000 in expenses related to M&A activities, the vast majority of which were legal expenses.\n\nNet loss in the second quarter was $54,000, or roughly breakeven on a per share basis, compared to a net loss of ($256,000), or ($0.01) per share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $318,000, compared to $201,000 in the year-ago quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA result is inclusive of the $307,000 in M&A activity related costs noted above (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nResearch Solutions President and CEO Roy W.

In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\n\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense), foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise.

          "content": "##  Loading Inline Form. \n\nTagged Sections\n\nSearch in All.\n\nSearch in Internal Sections Only.\n\nSearch in External Sections Only.\n\nClear Sections Search Submit Sections Search\n\nHelp\n\n#####  Getting Started\n\nThe Inline XBRL viewer allows a user to quickly and easily review details of the tagged information in an Inline document by automatically placing a top and bottom highlight border around each tagged numeric fact and left and right border for each block tagged fact. Hovering over a tagged fact will highlight (shade) all content related to the tagged fact, and clicking on a tagged fact will reveal its tagging details in the Fact Review Window. Navigation, search and filter options are also provided to easily refine and identify specific types of tagged information.\n\n#####  Fact Review Window\n\nThe Fact Review Window shows the tagging details for the currently selected fact, which is highlighted with a solid blue border. There are four categories of fact detail which can be viewed; an \"N/A\" value indicates there is no available information for the item within the given category:\n\n  * Attributes - All primary information (as applicable) describing the tagged fact including period, sign, decimals, dimensional detail (axes and members), scale, measure and data type.\n  * Labels - Detailed documentation (definition) for the tag used, and other labels.\n  * References - Authoritative reference information (as applicable) for the selected tag.\n  * Calculation - Balance and calculation hierarchy details (numeric non-dimensioned items only).\n\n\n\n#####  Searching\n\nThere are two ways to search the document: FACTS AND SECTIONS. To search information, enter a keyword in a search box and select the magnifying glass icon to return matching results. Search operators \"and\" (via \"AND\" or \"&\") and \"or\" (via \"OR\" or \"|\") are available to further refine a search.\n\n**FACTS**\n\nThe Search Facts box can be used to find tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels, and tagged content are included in Search. Tagged facts matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default) shading on the page and appear in the Facts List. Select the \"X\" button to the left of the magnifying glass icon to clear the search.\n\nThe content included in Search can be increased to included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative references by selecting the cog / wheel icon to the left of the search box. See Settings for more information.\n\n**SECTIONS**\n\nThe Search Sections box can be used to filter the tagged sections of the financial statements.\n\n#####  Filters\n\nFilters change the number of highlighted facts and items in the fact list by providing several ways to review and pinpoint certain tagged information. Multiple filters can be used at once.\n\n**DATA FILTERS**\n\nThese filter options allow the user to refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Amounts Only - Numeric facts only\n  * Text Only - Textual facts only\n  * Calculations Only - Numeric facts participating in a calculation only\n  * Negatives Only - Negative Numeric amounts only\n  * Additional Items Only - Tagged facts without a corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden facts) only\n\n\n\n**TAGS FILTER**\n\nThese filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts by tag type:\n\n  * All - Displays all tagged data (default)\n  * Standard Only- Facts with standard tags from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, IFRS, DEI).\n  * Custom Only - Facts with extension \"custom\" tags unique to the entity's document.\n\n\n\n**MORE FILTERS**\n\nAdditional filters that allow user to further refine the highlighted facts:\n\n  * Periods - List of all used context years and reporting periods\n  * Measures - List of all used units of measure (e.g., US Dollars); as applicable\n  * Axis - List of all used axis (dimensions); as applicable (dimensions); as applicable\n  * Scale - List of all used scaled options (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\n  * Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable\n\n\n\nMultiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged facts using custom tags and list them in the fact list. Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be removed individually by unchecking or selecting ALL option for each filter, or all at once via the \"Reset All Filters\" option.\n\n#####  Facts List (Results)\n\nOn the toolbar, select the \"count\" to the right of the word Facts (e.g., Facts 234) to reveal the Facts List results - a navigable listing of all currently highlighted tagged facts. The count represents the current number of facts.\n\nBy default, all tagged facts are displayed in the Fact List Results. The list content and count reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the list as well as move the current view to the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.\n\nCertain letters may appear to the right of an item in the Fact Result list to indicate a certain property. If the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\" appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional information.\n\n#####  Sections\n\nThe SECTIONS toolbar item provides a listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document. Sections are divided into three groups:\n\n  * Document & Entity Information\n  * Financial Statements\n  * Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n\n\nBy expanding a group and selecting a section item in the listing, Inline XBRL viewer will navigate to that section. When the Tagged Sections feature is open, the Search Sections box will additionally filter the list of sections to only those sections that match the entered criteria.\n\n#####  Menu\n\n**Information**\n\nThe Information menu item provides additional detail about the current Inline document and customizable viewer settings.\n\n  * Company and Document - Basic company and document information\n  * Tags - Fact and tag (standard and custom) information\n  * Files - Files used\n  * Additional Items - Additional hidden data that's been tagged but potentially does not have a corresponding location in the HTML\n\n\n\n**Save XBRL Instance**\n\nThe Save XBRL Instance menu item allows an XBRL instance document (*.xml) that is extracted from the Inline document to be saved locally for use by software supporting the XBRL format.\n\n**Save XBRL Zip**\n\nThe Save XBRL Zip menu item allows a zip file (*.zip) that contains the as-provided XBRL instance document and related custom taxonomy files to be saved locally.\n\n**Settings**\n\nThe Settings menu item provides the ability to customize Viewer features.\n\n**Tagged Fact Hover**\n\n  * On - Displays the hover fact review window for any tagged fact*\n  * Off - Hides the hover fact review window for any tagged fact (default)\n\n\n\n* May impact performance with certain web browsers.\n\n**Auto Scrolling Position**(This setting will have no effect on IE 10 or Safari) \n\n  * Top - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the Top of the Inline XBRL viewer window (default)\n  * Center - Selecting a fact from the Sections Menu or the Fact Menu will automatically scroll that element to the middle of the Inline XBRL viewer window\n\n\n\n**Highlight Colors** (Use the save and reset buttons to save the selected setting or reset to default) \n\n  * Tagged Data - Change the highlight color of the tagged fact border\n  * Search Results - Change the background color of tagged items matching the Search results\n  * Selected Fact - Change the color of highlight border used to identify the currently selected fact\n  * Tag Shading (hover) - Change the color of the shading applied to tagged data on hover\n\n\n\n**Search Options**\n\n  * Match Case - Matches the specific case of the entered Search keyword\n  * Include Labels - Extends Search to include tag labels\n  * Include Definitions - Extends Search to include tag definitions\n  * Include Dimensions - Extends Search to include dimensional detail\n  * Include References - Extends Search to include authoritative reference information. Optionally specify the reference parts to include in the search (e.g., topic, subtopic, section)\n\n\n\n**Help**(this content) \n\n**Version**\n\nIndicates the current build of the Inline XBRL viewer application.\n\nFacts\n\nSelect Page\n\nLoading.\n\nCopy and Paste Below Content.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nSettings\n\nHover over Fact for quick information.

(NASDAQ: RSSS), a trusted partner providing cloud-based workflow solutions to accelerate research for R&D-driven organizations, reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Research Solutions, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1154590/Research_Solutions_Reprints_Desk_Logo.html)\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Summary**\n\n  * Total revenue of $10.1 million, a 16% increase from the prior-year quarter.\n  * Platform revenue up 29% to $2.6 million. Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") of over $11.0 million.\n  * Gross profit up 20% from prior-year quarter. Total gross margin improved 150 basis points to 40.1%.\n  * Loss of ($988,000) or ($0.04) per share, compared to net income of $215,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. This quarter's loss includes $1.161M in expenses itemized as follows: $339,000 in costs associated with M&A activities, $542,000 in proxy-related expenses and $280,000 in separation costs related to the termination of the Executive Chairman.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of ($441,000) compared to $433,000 in the prior-year quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA result includes approximately $1.078M in costs related to the M&A activities, proxy-related expenses and separation expenses noted above. Without these costs, Adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $637,000.\n  * The company closed its acquisition of Resolute Innovation, Inc. (\"ResoluteAI\") on July 28, 2023. The numbers for the quarter are inclusive of approximately two months of activity from ResoluteAI.\n\n\n\n\"Our first quarter results reflect the continued growth across our platform and transaction offerings and our acquisition of ResoluteAI completed in late July, which helped push our ARR over $11 million,\" said Roy W. Olivier, President and CEO of Research Solutions. \"We continue to experience softer growth in our platform products due to ongoing inflationary pressures and budgetary constraints, however, our profit performance remained strong when you exclude a number of unique items that impacted our first quarter. Lasty, we continue to be active in the M&A market with additional potential transactions that we believe will help complete our product set and enhance our growth profile.\" \n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $10.1 million, a 16% increase from $8.7 million in the year-ago quarter as both platform and transaction revenue increased from the prior-year period.\n\nPlatform subscription revenue increased 29% to $2.6 million compared to $2.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the total number of paid Platform deployments and the acquisition of ResoluteAI, as well as upsells to existing customers. When consolidating ARR from the ResoluteAI acquisition, the quarter ended with annual recurring revenue of $11.0 million, up 32% year-over-year (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\n\nTransaction revenue was $7.5 million, compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to organic growth and higher transaction volumes related to contracts transferred from FIZ Karlsruhe effective on January 1, 2023. The transaction customer count for the quarter was 1,395, compared to 1,220 customers in the prior-year quarter (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\n\nTotal gross margin improved 150 basis points from the prior-year quarter to 40.1%. The increase was primarily driven by a continued revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business as well as increased margins in the transactions business.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.1 million, compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. This quarter's results include $339,000 in expenses related to the Company's M&A activities, $542,000 in proxy-related expenses and $280,000 in separation costs related to the termination of the Executive Chairman.\n\nNet loss in the first quarter was ($988,000), or ($0.04) per share, compared to net income of $215,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.

The quantity of customers per month is defined as customers with at least one transaction during the month.\n\nA transaction is an order for a unit of copyrighted content fulfilled or managed in the Platform.\n\nThe company defines annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") as the value of contracted Platform subscription recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measure – Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nResearch Solutions' management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\n\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense), foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise. Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss):\n\n**Quarter Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2023** | **2022** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n**Net Income (loss)** | $ (988,043) | $ 214,565 | $ (1,202,608) | -560.5 %  \nAdd (deduct):  \nOther income (expense) | (140,311) | (39,069) | (101,242) | 259.1 %  \nForeign currency translation loss | 6,620 | 72,516 | (65,896) | -90.9 %  \nProvision for income taxes | 29,402 | 4,133 | 25,269 | 611.4 %  \nDepreciation and amortization | 59,620 | 5,812 | 53,808 | 925.8 %  \nStock-based compensation | 591,814 | 175,361 | 416,453 | 237.5 %  \nGain on sale of disc. ops. | - | - | -  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ (440,898) | $ 433,318 | $ (874,216) | -201.7 %  \n  \n**About Research Solutions** Research Solutions, Inc.
