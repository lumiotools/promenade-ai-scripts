(\"**XORTX** \" or the “**Company** ”) (NASDAQ: XRTX | TSXV: XRTX | Frankfurt: ANU), a late-stage clinical pharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies to treat progressive kidney disease, is pleased to announce the acceptance of an abstract submitted to the American Society of Nephrology (the “ASN”). The abstract entitled **\"Xanthine oxidase in rats, mice and humans with polycystic kidney disease\"** was reviewed by the ASN review panel for scientific merit and novel discoveries. The study was conducted at the University of Colorado in the independent laboratory of Dr. Charles Edelstein and was sponsored by XORTX and will be presented during the Session Title: Genetic Diseases: Cystic - Therapeutic Investigations and Prognosis. Selected results from the study include:\n\n**In both Rat or Mouse models of Polycystic Kidney Disease (“PKD”)**\n\ni) Use of a uricase inhibitor to increase uric acid resulted in increased cyst growthii) Xanthine oxidase (“XO”) inhibitor – Oxypurinol – decreased serum uric acid and cyst growthiii) Increased XO staining in kidney and liver was abundant\n\n**Prospective / Retrospective Clinical Results of the Halt Clinical Trial - Group A - Early PKD patients**\n\niv) Patients with increased serum uric acid had increased total kidney volumev) Patients with increased serum uric acid had faster PKD progressionvi) Increase serum XO activity was associated with an earlier onset of high blood pressure\n\n**About this Study**\n\nThe XO enzyme is an essential enzyme within the uric acid pathway, and is required for the breakdown of purine nucleotides. Uric acid as well as reactive oxygen species released during the enzymatic reaction may also play a detrimental role in the circulatory system and within tissue during disease. Recent pioneering discoveries in rodent models of PKD implicate over expression or over activity of XO. It is currently unknown if XO over expression or over activity in humans is associated with PKD or more rapid progression of disease. The aim of the study was to gain insight into whether increased XO activity results in cyst growth, XO activity was measured in PCK1 rats, PKD1RC/RC (RC) mice and 34 patients from the HALT-PKD Clinical study.\n\nThe abstract outlines study results from rat, mice and human studies of PKD. The purpose of the study was to gain and understanding of serum xanthine oxidase activity (XOa) in PKD during varied stages of disease and further to relate that activity to total kidney volume, and decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The results of the study provide understanding of where aberrant purine metabolism in PKD tissue due to sources XO enzyme may contribute to circulating uric acid levels, expansion rate of kidney and cyst and functional GFR decline. Prior study results suggested over expression of XO in PKD kidney tissue may be a feature of cystic disease.\n\nDr. Allen Davidoff, CEO of XORTX commented, “Exploring and understanding the contribution of chronically increased serum uric acid and/or the effect of too much or too active XO enzyme in the circulation or tissue on PKD disease progression was a goal of this study. The study results presented today are another pioneering first step towards characterizing how and when to treat individuals with PKD as well as how they might benefit from the Company’s XRx-008 program, and our upcoming registration clinical trial. This study was a preliminary investigation of individuals with early stage PKD, and provided information regarding the health consequences of hyperuricemia and XO. The Company will continue to add to this exciting discovery with future exploration of later stage PKD, assessment of genetic factors contributing to aberrant purine metabolism, including XO overexpression, and this precision medicine opportunity.”\n\n**About XORTX Therapeutics Inc.**\n\nXORTX is a pharmaceutical company with two clinically advanced products in development: 1) our lead, XRx-008 program for ADPKD; and 2) our secondary program in XRx-101 for acute kidney and other acute organ injury associated with Coronavirus / COVID-19 infection.

expressed in U.S. Dollars)\n1. Nature of operations\nXORTX Therapeutics Inc. (the “Company” or “XORTX”) was incorporated under the laws of Alberta,\nCanada on August 24, 2012.\nXORTX is a public company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) and on the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “XRTX”. The Company’s operations and mailing address is 3710 –\n33rd Street NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2L 2M1 and its registered address is located at 550 Burrard\nStreet, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 0A3.\nXORTX is a late stage clinical pharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies to treat\nprogressive kidney disease modulated by aberrant purine and uric acid metabolism in orphan disease\nindications such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, as well as more prevalent type 2\ndiabetic nephropathy, and fatty liver disease. The Company’s current focus is on developing products to\nslow and/or reverse the progression of kidney disease in patients at risk of end stage kidney failure.\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks associated with the successful development of new products\nand their marketing and the conduct of its clinical studies and their results. The Company will have to\nfinance its research and development activities and its clinical studies. To achieve the objectives in its\nbusiness plan, the Company plans to raise the necessary capital and to generate revenues. Although there\nis no certainty, management is of the opinion that additional funding for future projects and operations can\nbe raised as needed. The products developed by the Company will require approval from the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration and equivalent organizations in other countries before their sale can be authorized.\nIf the Company is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate financing in the future, research activities will be\npostponed until market conditions improve.\n2. Basis of preparation\nStatement of Compliance\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nInternational Accounting Standard 34 (IAS 34), Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nAccordingly, certain disclosures included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS\nAccounting Standards (“IFRS”) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBasis of Measurement and Presentation\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost\nconvention except for financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. These condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements were prepared on an accrual basis except for cash flow information.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the\nCompany and its 100% owned subsidiary, XORTX Pharma Corp. The accounts of the Company’s\nsubsidiary are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting\npolicies. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions are\neliminated.\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors\non November 13, 2024.\n6\nXORTX THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited - expressed in U.S. Dollars)\n3. Material Accounting policies\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with\nthe material accounting policies disclosed in the annual financial statements for the year ended December\n31, 2023. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\n4. Critical accounting judgments and estimates\nThe preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make\njudgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements and notes. By their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to change and the effect\non the condensed interim consolidated financial statements of changes in such judgments and estimates\nin future periods could be material. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience,\ncurrent and future economic conditions, and other factors, including expectations of future events that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgments and\nestimates.\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and may\naffect both the period of revision and future periods. Information about critical accounting judgments in\napplying accounting policies that have the most significant risk of causing material adjustment to the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are discussed below:\nShare-based payment transactions and warrant liabilities\nThe Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair\nvalue of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. Warrant liabilities are accounted for\nas derivative liabilities as the proceeds from exercise are either not fixed, denominated in a currency other\nthan the functional currency, or can be settled on a net basis, and therefore do not meet the fixed for fixed\ncriteria. Estimating fair value for share-based transactions requires determining the most appropriate\nvaluation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the instrument. This estimate also\nrequires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the\nshare option or warrant, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\nClassification of contract payments\nIn concluding that contract payments are a non-current asset, management considered when future\nregulatory and clinical trial programs are anticipated to be completed. Management assessed that the future\nregulatory and clinical trial programs would not be completed within 12 months from period end and\ntherefore classified contract payments as a non-current asset.\nImpairment of intangible assets\nPatents (obtained and pending) and licenses are reviewed for impairment at each financial reporting date.\nIf, in the judgment of management, future economic benefits will not flow to the Company, then the\nCompany will assess the recoverable value of the asset. If the carrying value is greater than the recoverable\nvalue, the asset will be impaired to the recoverable value.\nDetermination of functional currency\nIn concluding that the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiary, management\nconsidered the currency that mainly influences the cost of providing goods and services in the primary\neconomic environment in which each entity operates and the currency in which funds from financing are\ngenerated, or if there has been a change in events or conditions that determined the primary economic\nenvironment.\n7\nXORTX THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited - expressed in U.S. Dollars)\n4. Critical accounting judgments and estimates (continued)\nTreatment of research and development costs\nCosts to develop products are capitalized to the extent that the criteria for recognition as intangible assets\nin IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met. Those criteria require that the product is technically and economically\nfeasible, the Company has the intention and ability to use the asset, and how the asset will generate future\nbenefits. Management assessed the capitalization of development costs based on the attributes of the\ndevelopment project, perceived user needs, industry trends and expected future economic conditions.\nManagement considers these factors in aggregate and applies significant judgment to determine whether\nthe product is feasible. The Company has not capitalized any development costs as at September 30, 2024.\nLeases\nValue of right-of-use assets and lease obligations require judgement in determining lease terms such as\nextension options, determining whether a lease contract contains an identified asset to which the Company\nhas the right to use substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that asset and the incremental\nborrowing rate applied. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term,\ncollateral assumptions and the economic environment in which the lease is denominated. Renewal options\nare only included if management is reasonably certain that the option will be renewed.\n5. Cash\nThe Company’s cash consists of cash held and interest-bearing deposits with the Company’s bank and\nbrokerage accounts. The current annual interest rate earned on these deposits is 4.41% (December 31,\n2023 – 5.15%).\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nCash 71,652 94,999\nInterest-bearing deposits 2,229,095 3,352,666\n2,300,747 3,447,665\n6.

As part of the agreement, the Company paid $1,200,000 through the issuance of units in the private\nplacement that closed February 28, 2020, to be applied to future regulatory and clinical trial programs. The\n108,590 units issued were measured by reference to their fair value on the issuance date, which is equal\nto CAD $14.76 per unit.\n8\nXORTX THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited - expressed in U.S. Dollars)\n8.

Share capital and reserves (continued)\ng) Derivative Warrant Liability (continued)\nThese warrants are revalued at each reporting period and any gain or loss is recorded in profit or loss.\nEffective January 1, 2023, with the change in functional currency of the Company to USD, the exercise\nprice of warrants denominated in Canadian Dollars is now denominated in a currency different than the\nfunctional currency of the Company and therefore these warrants now meet the definition of a derivative\nfinancial liability. Accordingly, all Canadian Dollar denominated warrants recorded as equity\ninstruments on January 1, 2023, were reclassified to derivative warrant liabilities at their estimated fair\nvalue as of that date.\nThe fair value of the warrants issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with an\nexercise price denominated in Canadian Dollars was estimated at $968,000 on the date of grant using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following data and assumptions:\n2024\nDividend yield Nil\nAnnualized volatility 130-135%\nShare price CAD $3.10\nRisk-free interest rate 4.17% – 4.36 %\nExpected life 2 years\nThe balance of the derivative warrant liabilities (level 3) is as follows:\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 3,854,403\nReclassified from reserves 318,000\nFair value adjustment (3,641,403)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 531,000\nWarrants issued February 15, 2024 865,000\nWarrants issued March 4, 2024 103,000\nWarrants exercised (5,244)\nFair value adjustment (164,756)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $1,329,000\nSignificant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nShare price $ 1.64 $ 2.31\nRisk-free interest rate 2.94% 3.25%-3.91%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected volatility 124-146% 100%\nRemaining term (in years) 1.4–3.0 2.1-3.8\nThe fair value is classified as level 3 as expected volatility is determined using historical volatility and is\ntherefore not an observable input.\n16\nXORTX THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited - expressed in U.S. Dollars)\n12. Share capital and reserves (continued)\ng) Derivative Warrant Liability (continued)\nManagement has assessed the revised interpretive guidance in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of\nFinancial Statements Amendments effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024\nwith respect to its derivative warrant liability and determined those instruments meet the requirement to\nbe classified as a current liability. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified derivative warrant liabilities\nof $531,000 on the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023 to conform to the current\nperiod’s presentation. The change in presentation had no impact on net and comprehensive loss, or\ncash flows, or loss per share for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, or year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The change in presentation had no impact on total assets, total liabilities or\nshareholders equity as at December 31, 2023.\n13.

Our\naim is to advance novel proprietary formulations of oxypurinol, a uric acid lowering agent that works by\neffectively inhibiting xanthine oxidase. We are developing product candidates that include new or existing\ndrugs that can be adapted to address different disease indications where aberrant purine metabolism and/or\nelevated uric acid is a common denominator, including polycystic kidney disease, pre-diabetes, insulin\nresistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and infection. We are focused on building\na pipeline of assets to address the unmet medical needs for patients with a variety of serious or life-\nthreatening diseases using our innovative formulation of oxypurinol, and our proprietary pipeline-in-a-\nproduct strategy supported by our intellectual property, established exclusive manufacturing agreements,\nand proposed clinical trials with experienced clinicians.\nOur three unique product development programs are:\n• XRx-008, a program for the treatment of ADPKD;\n• XRx-101, a program to treat AKI associated with respiratory virus infection, AKI and associated health\nconsequences; and\n• XRx- 225, a program for the treatment of T2DN.\nAt XORTX, we aim to redefine the treatment of kidney diseases by developing medications to improve the\nquality of life of patients with life threatening diseases by modulating aberrant purine and uric acid\nmetabolism, including lowering elevated uric acid as a therapy.\nOur Proprietary Therapeutic Platforms\nOur expertise and understanding of the pathological effects of aberrant purine metabolism combined with\nour understanding of uric acid lowering agent structure and function, has enabled the development of our\nproprietary therapeutic platforms. These are a complementary suite of therapeutic formulations and new\nchemical entities designed to provide unique solutions for acute and chronic disease. Our therapeutic\nplatforms can be used alone, or in combination, with synergistic activity to develop a multifunctional tailored\napproach to a variety of indications that can address disease in multiple body systems through management\nof chronic or acute hyperuricemia, immune modulation, and metabolic disease. We continue to leverage\nthese therapeutic platforms to expand our pipeline of novel and next generation drug-based product\ncandidates that we believe could represent significant improvements to the standard of care in multiple\nacute and chronic cardiovascular diseases and specifically kidney disease.\nWe believe our in-house drug design and formulation capabilities confer a competitive advantage to our\ntherapeutic platforms and are ultimately reflected in our programs. Some of these key advantages are:\nHighly Modular and Customizable\nOur platforms can be combined in multiple ways and this synergy can be applied to address acute,\nintermittent or chronic disease progression. For example, our XRx-101 program for AKI associated with\nrespiratory virus infection is designed to produce rapid suppression of hyperuricemia and then maintain\npurine metabolism at a low level during viral infection and target management of acute organ injury. Our\nXRx-008 program is designed for longer term stable chronic oral dosing of xanthine oxidase inhibitors\n(“XOI”). We believe that the capabilities of our formulation technology allow us to manage the unique\nchallenges of cardiovascular and renal disease by modulating purine metabolism, inflammatory and\noxidative state.\n3\nFit-for-purpose\nOur platforms can also be utilized to engineer new chemical entities and formulations of those agents that\nhave enhanced properties. For example, our XRx-225 product candidate program, some of the intellectual\nproperty for which we license from third parties, represents a potential new class of xanthine oxidase\ninhibitor(s) with a targeted design to enhance anti-inflammatory activity. The capability of tailoring the\npotential therapeutic benefit of this class of new agents permits us to identify targets and disease that we\nwish to exploit and then, through formulation design, optimize those small molecules and proprietary\nformulations to maximize potentially clinically meaningful therapeutic effect.\nReadily Scalable and Transferable\nOur in-house small molecule and formulations design expertise is positioned to create a steady succession\nof drug product candidates that are scalable, efficient to manufacture (by us or a partner or contract\nmanufacturing organization) and produce large scale and high purity active pharmaceutical drug product.\nWe believe this will provide a competitive advantage, new intellectual property and opportunity to provide\nfirst-in-class products that target unmet medical needs and clinically meaningful quality of life.\nOur team’s expertise in uric acid lowering agents, specifically in the development and use of xanthine\noxidase inhibitors, has enabled the development of our therapeutic product candidates to treat the\nsymptoms of, and potentially delay the progression of ADPKD, AKI associated with respiratory virus\ninfection, and T2DN. We note that there is no guarantee that the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (“FDA”) will approve our proposed uric acid lowering agent product candidates for the\ntreatment of kidney disease or the health consequences of diabetes.\nProduct Candidate Pipeline\nOur product candidates include XRx-008, XRx-101, and XRx-225. Our lead program, XRx-008, has\nreported topline results for the XRX-OXY-101 Bridging Pharmacokinetic Study of XORLOTM (the “XRX-\nOXY-101 PK Clinical Trial”) in advance of initiating Phase 3 registration clinical trial testing, the last stage\nof clinical development before application for FDA approval. Discussions with the FDA have confirmed that\na single clinical trial with a one-year treatment period would be sufficient to make this program eligible for\naccelerated approval once the benefit of XORLOTM on decreasing the rate of decline of glomerular filtration\nrate was demonstrated. Our reported study XRX-OXY-101 supports both the XRx-008 and XRx-101\nprograms. Future late-stage clinical studies targeting attenuation or reversal of AKI in hospitalized\nindividuals with respiratory virus infection are planned. XRx-225 is a non-clinical stage program advancing\nnew chemical entities toward the clinical development stage.\nProducts\nThe Company’s lead and most advanced development program, XRx-008, is a late clinical stage program\nfocused on demonstrating the potential of our novel product candidate for ADPKD. XRx-008 is the\ndevelopment name given to XORTX's therapeutics program and associated proprietary oral formulation of\noxypurinol, XORLOTM. XORLOTM has shown increased oral bioavailability compared to a control\nformulation and demonstrates the potential for an expanded use across a broad therapeutic range. XORTX\nis also developing a drug product combination therapy that includes both intravenous uric acid lowering\ntherapy combined with an oral anti-hyperuricemic xanthine oxidase inhibitor, XRx-101, for use in treating\npatients with AKI associated with respiratory virus infection and/or associated co-morbidities including\nsepsis.\nXORLOTM is the working name of XORTX’s unique proprietary formulation of oxypurinol being developed\nfor the XRx-008 drug development program for testing in the XRX-OXY-201 and XRX-OXY-301 clinical\ntrials.\nXORTX is currently evaluating novel XOI candidates for the XRx-225 program to potentially treat T2DN as\nwell as developing new chemical entities to address other orphan and large market unmet medical need.\n4\nPatents\nXORTX is the exclusive licensee of two U.S. granted patents with claims to the use of all uric acid lowering\nagents to treat insulin resistance or diabetic nephropathy, and two U.S. patent applications with similar\nclaims for the treatment of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and fatty liver disease. Counterparts for some of\nthese patent applications have also been submitted in Europe. In both the US and Europe, XORTX owns\ncomposition of matter patent applications for unique proprietary formulations of xanthine oxidase inhibitors\n– U.S. and European patents have been granted. XORTX has also submitted two patent applications to\ncover the use of uric acid lowering agents for the treatment of the health consequences of respiratory virus\ninfection. Recently, XORTX filed a third provisional patent application covering formulations and methods\nof dosing xanthine oxidase inhibitors in individuals with kidney disease.\nOUR STRATEGY\nThe Company’s goal is to apply our interdisciplinary expertise and pipeline-in-a-product strategy to further\nidentify, develop and commercialize novel treatments in orphan indications, with an initial focus on renal\nand significant unmet medical needs.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy is subject to numerous risks. These risks include, among\nothers (see “Risks Related to the Business”):\n• we will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms,\nor at all, and, if not available, may require us to alter, delay, scale back, or cease our product\ndevelopment programs or operations;\n• we have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur\nlosses for the foreseeable future;\n• we have not generated any revenue to date and may never be profitable;\n• we have a limited number of product candidates, all of which are still in preclinical or clinical\ndevelopment, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval or experience significant delays in doing\nso;\n• our product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing\napproval or, if approved, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include\ncontraindications, warnings and precautions, limitations of use, or otherwise limit their sales;\n• we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates under applicable\nregulatory requirements, and the denial or delay of any such approval would delay\ncommercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and adversely impact our potential to\ngenerate revenue, our business and our results of operations;\n• security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information\nrelated to our business or protected health information or prevent us from accessing critical\ninformation and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation;\n• our existing strategic partnerships are important to our business, and future strategic partnerships\nmay also be important to us; if we are unable to maintain any of these strategic partnerships, or if\nthese strategic partnerships are not successful, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our\nstrategic partnerships and our business could be adversely affected;\n• we rely on third parties to monitor, support, conduct and oversee clinical trials of the product\ncandidates that we are developing and, in some cases, to maintain regulatory files for those product\ncandidates;\n• our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents\nand other proprietary rights of third parties;\n• our patents covering one or more of our products or product candidates could be found invalid or\nunenforceable if challenged;\n• if we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for our product\ncandidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed; and\n• if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our\ntechnology and products could be adversely affected.\n5\nFunding Requirements\nThe Company has not generated any revenue from product sales to date and does not expect to do so until\nsuch time as XORTX obtains regulatory approval for and commercializes one or more of our product\ncandidates. As the Company is currently in clinical and preclinical stages of development, it will be some\ntime before we expect to achieve this, and it is uncertain that we ever will. We expect that we will continue\nto increase our operating expenses in connection with ongoing clinical trials and preclinical activities and\nthe development of product candidates in our pipeline. We also expect to continue our strategic\npartnerships and we continue to seek additional collaboration opportunities. Further, we expect to continue\nour efforts to pursue additional grants and refundable tax credits from the Canadian government in order\nto further our research and development. Although it is difficult to predict our funding requirements, based\nupon our current operating plan, the Company anticipates that our existing cash and cash equivalents as\nof September 30, 2024, combined with the net proceeds of future financings, will enable us to advance the\nclinical development of XRx-008 and XRx-101 product candidates. The XRx-008 will receive 98% of\nfunding, subject to available funds. The XRx-101 and XRx-225 programs will not be advanced until\nsufficient funding is available. Approximately 2% of funding is anticipated for intellectual property\ndevelopment. XORTX may also be eligible to receive certain research, development, and commercial\nmilestone payments in the future. However, because successful development of our product candidates\nand the achievement of milestones by our strategic partners is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the\nactual funds we will require to complete the research, development, and commercialization of product\ncandidates.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancing Activities\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company closed its registered direct offering and concurrent private placement for\nthe purchase and sale of: (i) 320,000 common share units (\"Common Share Units\") at a price of $1.85 per\nCommon Share Unit, with each Common Share Unit consisting of one common share and one warrant\n(\"Warrant\") to purchase one common share; and (ii) 490,810 pre-funded warrant units (“Pre-Funded Units”)\nat a price of $1.8499 per Pre-Funded Unit, with each Pre-Funded Unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant\n(“Pre-Funded Warrant”) to purchase one common share and one Warrant to purchase one common share.\nAggregate gross proceeds amounted to $1,500,000. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of\n$0.0001 per share, and will terminate once exercised in full. The Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price\nof $2.18 are immediately exercisable and expire five years from issuance. The company intends to use the\nnet proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn February 15 and March 4, 2024, the Company closed two tranches of a non-brokered offering of\n899,717 common share units at a price of CAD $3 per common share unit for aggregate gross proceeds of\nCAD $2,699,151. Each common share unit consisted of one common share and one warrant to purchase\none common share at CAD $4.50 per common share for a period of two years. The warrants were\nimmediately exercisable, and may be exercised for two years from the date of issuance, provided, however\nthat, if, the common shares on the TSXV trade at greater than CAD $6.00 for 10 or more consecutive\ntrading days, the warrants will be accelerated and the warrants will expire on the 30th business day following\nnotice. In connection with the non-brokered offering, the Company paid finder’s fees of CAD $132,551,\nrepresenting a 5% finder’s fee on certain subscriptions to qualified finders.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company announced it had received TSXV\napproval to amend the terms of an aggregate of 1,125,210 outstanding common share purchase warrants\nas follows:\n• 198,333 of the warrants issued pursuant to the private placement that closed on February 9, 2021 and\nwhich had an original exercise price of CAD $42.26 per share (CAD $0.40 per share, adjusted to reflect\nthe 2021 and 2023 Share Consolidations), the TSXV has approved an amended exercise price of\n$5.00.\n6\n• 371,322 of the warrants issued pursuant to the prospectus offering that closed on October 15, 2021\nand which had an original exercise price of $42.93 per share ($4.77 per share, adjusted to reflect the\n2023 Share Consolidation), the TSXV has approved an amended exercise price of $5.00.\n• 555,555 of the warrants issued pursuant to the prospectus offering that closed on October 7, 2022 and\nwhich had an original exercise price of $10.98 per share ($1.22 per share, adjusted to reflect the 2023\nShare Consolidation), the TSXV has approved an amended exercise price of $5.00.\nIf the volume weighted average price for the Company’s common shares on TSXV is greater than $6.50\n(approximately CAD $8.7562) per common share for a period of ten (10) consecutive trading days, then\nthe Company may give notice to the Holders of the Warrant by way of a news release (the “Notice”)\nnotifying such Holder that the warrants must be exercised within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of\ndelivery of such Notice, otherwise the warrants will expire at 4:30 p.m. (Calgary time) on the 30th day after\nthe date of delivery of the Notice (the “Forced Conversion Right”). Notwithstanding anything herein to\nthe contrary, the Forced Conversion Right shall only be available to the Company on or after such time in\nwhich such forced exercise of the warrants will result in the issuance of free trading shares to the Holder.\nRegulatory Advancements\nOn January 3, 2024, the Company announced the submission of a new patent for the treatment of chronic\nkidney disease (“CKD”). This patent is designed to protect new discoveries and strategies for the treatment\nof individuals with varied degrees of kidney function in the setting of CKD.\nChanges in Officers and Directors\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company announced Dr. Ronald Perrone has joined the Company’s Clinical\nAdvisory Board.\nOn April 8, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Ms. Abigail Jenkins to the Board of Directors.\nFUTURE PLANS AND OUTLOOK\nXORTX intends to grow its business by developing three programs focused on kidney disease.\nRecent independent peer-reviewed research that reported that genetic factors are linked to the over-\nexpression of xanthine oxidase (“XO”) and play a role in several diseases, including kidney disease, have\nprovided the Company with the opportunity to develop diagnostics that identify specific genetic factors.\nThese diagnostic tools alongside the Company’s expertise at developing unique formulations of uric acid\nlowering agents and XO inhibitors will permit XORTX to tailor treatments to subpopulations of individuals\nthat have common susceptibility or similar response to a particular drug. The Company will begin evaluating\nindividuals as early as our planned registration clinical trial in patients with ADPKD providing XORTX with\nan opportunity to better understand the role these genetic factors play in progressive kidney disease.\nFor the balance of 2024, XORTX will continue to focus on advancing XORLOTM for the XRx-008 program\nfor ADPKD into a Phase 2/3 “registration” clinical trial program – XRX-OXY-201, ODD in the EU, discussion\nwith the US FDA regarding the XRX-OXY-301 clinical trial and possible initiation of special protocol\nassessment (“SPA”) discussions with the FDA and initiation of commercialization activities, if approved, for\nXORLOTM as well as advancing research in other kidney disease applications. To achieve these objectives,\nXORTX’s action plan includes:\n1. Under the XRx-008 program, initiate the Pivotal Registration clinical trial named “XRX-OXY-\n201”, to support an application for “Accelerated Approval” of XORLOTM for individuals with\nADPKD. The XRX-OXY-201 Clinical Trial is a Phase 2b/3a, Multi-Centre, Double-Blind, Placebo\nControlled, Randomized Withdrawal Design Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a Novel\nOxypurinol Formulation in Patients with Progressing Stage 3-4 ADPKD and Coexistent\nHyperuricemia. The XRX-OXY-201 Clinical Trial will provide data for future “Accelerated Approval\"\n7\nNDA submissions to the FDA and MAA to the EMA. Subject to available financing, the XRX-OXY-\n201 Clinical Trial is planned to start in the first half of 2025 and enroll individuals with stage 3 or 4\nADPKD and presenting with chronically high uric acid. The objective of the XRX-OXY-201 Clinical\nTrial is to evaluate the ability of XORLOTM to slow rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate and/or\nthe expansion of total kidney volume over a 12-month treatment period. An estimated 150 patients\nwill be enrolled with 120 patients completing the study. (Estimated cost - $5 million to $30 million.)\n2. Under the XRx-008 program, prepare and communicate with the FDA and EMA regarding a\nsecond phase clinical trial named “XRX-OXY-301”, a Full Registration trial in ADPKD. The\nXRX-OXY-301 Clinical Trial is a Phase 3, Multi-Centre, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled,\nRandomized Withdrawal Design Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Oxypurinol\nFormulation in Patients with Progressing Stage 2-4 ADPKD and Coexistent Hyperuricemia with\nprogressing stage 2, 3, or 4 kidney disease. The objective of the XRX-OXY-301 Clinical Trial is to\nevaluate the safety and effectiveness of XORLOTM for the XRx-008 program over a 24-month\ntreatment period and obtain “full FDA marketing approval”. The aim of the XRX-OXY-301 Clinical\nTrial is to characterize the ability of XORLOTM to potentially decrease the rate of decline of\nglomerular filtration rate. An estimated 300 patients will be enrolled. Subject to available financing,\nthe XRX-OXY-301 Clinical Trial will not be scheduled or budgeted until XRX-OXY-201 is well\nunderway, and may be subject to SPA review by FDA.\n3. Ongoing CMC Work. In parallel with the XRX-OXY-201 and XRX-OXY-301 Clinical Trials, XORTX\nwill focus on scale-up, validation and stability testing of clinical drug product supplies of XORLOTM\nunder the Company’s granted IND, as well as building, validating and characterization of stability\nof future clinical and commercial supplies. All development will be performed according to current\nGMP methodology. This work will be ongoing throughout 2024 to 2027. (Estimated cost of Clinical\nand Commercial drug supply - $5 million to $15 million.)\n4. Activities Related to Potential Commercial Launch. In preparation for a possible “Accelerated\nApproval\" NDA filing in 2027 for XORLOTM for XRx-008, XORTX will conduct commercialization\nstudies to support in-depth analysis of pricing and/or reimbursement, as well as evaluate product\nbrand name selection and prepare related filings and conduct other launch preparation activities.\nThis work will be ongoing from 2024 to 2027. (Estimated cost - $500,000 and $3 million.)\n5. Activities Related to European Registration. XORTX will continue to work with and seek out\nguidance from the EMA to facilitate the path to potential approval of XORLOTM in the EU, including\nrequired clinical studies and reimbursement conditions. This work will be ongoing from 2024\nthrough 2027 and will include continued pursuit of orphan drug status. In addition, XORTX is\nupdating an information dossier to support an orphan drug designation from the EMA. (Estimated\ncost - $500,000 and $3 million.)\nTo achieve the above goals, XORTX will continue to pursue non-dilutive and dilutive funding and expand\ndiscussions to partner with major pharma / biotech companies with a global reach. XORTX will also increase\nfinancial and healthcare conference participation to further strengthen and expand its investor base.\n8\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results prepared by management for the eight previous\nquarters to September 30, 2024:\n(unaudited) 2024 Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q1 2023 Q4\nResearch and development 34,741 67,683 73,643 134,132\nConsulting, wages and benefits 213,340 360,617 224,721 260,607\nDirectors’ fees 40,144 46,371 39,161 45,495\nInvestor relations 236,603 502,265 439,405 278,934\nProfessional fees 195,527 274,635 120,210 56,363\nGeneral and administrative 81,765 92,258 74,920 93,567\nPublic company costs 30,823 56,053 29,683 29,630\nTravel - 16,728 1,607 31,771\nAmortization of property and equipment 19,560 26,885 20,246 18,299\nAmortization of intangible assets 6,389 6,164 11,886 6,061\nShare based payments (1) 15,857 44,031 53,134 28,815\nLoss/(gain) on derivative warrant liability (244,000) (1,645,548) 1,724,792 (3,641,403)\nForeign exchange (gain) loss (14,715) 17,744 12,644 8,320\nInterest income (29,023) (35,952) (31,602) (49,815)\nTransaction costs on derivative warrant liability - - 224,486 -\nTotal (loss) income (587,011) 170,066 (3,018,936) 2,699,224\n(Loss) income per share (0.20) 0.06 (1.24) 1.38\n(unaudited) 2023 Q3 2023 Q2 2023 Q1 2022 Q4\nResearch and development 569,713 667,913 1,046,957 1,903,204\nConsulting, wages and benefits 249,033 343,606 184,312 219,183\nDirectors’ fees 46,469 43,204 44,238 42,077\nInvestor relations 236,934 223,334 180,288 182,192\nProfessional fees 102,617 214,425 140,858 92,434\nGeneral and administrative 90,140 90,299 101,499 88,226\nPublic company costs 45,822 47,371 47,361 31,280\nTravel 14,267 68,765 55,384 11,041\nAmortization of property and equipment 18,329 18,328 18,105 16,836\nAmortization of intangible assets (1,862) 13,692 48,742 5,721\nShare based payments (1) 21,850 30,769 39,550 67,682\nGain on derivative warrant liability - - - (1,579,802)\nForeign exchange (gain) loss 3,668 3,494 (8,457) 626,369\nInterest income (63,614) (73,312) (66,802) (53,716)\nTransaction costs on derivative warrant liability - - - 926,456\nTotal loss (1,333,366) (1,691,888) (1,832,035) (2,579,183)\nLoss per share (0.67) (0.85) (0.95) (1.62)\nNotes:\n(1) Share based payments relate to the vesting of options over the period.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nThe Company has a net loss of $587,011 ($0.20 per share) for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to a loss of $1,333,366 ($0.67 per share) in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nVariances within the loss items are as follows:\nConsulting, wages and benefits - $213,340 (2023 - $249,033) – Consulting expenses decreased during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, as less consultants were engaged during the current quarter\ndue to a decrease in Company activity with respect to corporate development.\n9\nProfessional fees - $195,527 (2023 - $102,617). Professional fees, which consists mainly of accounting,\naudit and legal fees, increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the\n2023 period, due to the Company’s increased corporate activity.\nResearch and development - $34,741 (2023 - $569,713) – Research and development expenses\ndecreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year as\ndetailed in the following table:\nThe table below presents combined research and development costs for XRx-008, XRx-101, and XRx-225\nas the Company’s projects are presently run concurrently and in combination.\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 Change $ Change %\nClinical trials expenses 1 5,679 275,066 (269,387) (98%)\nManufacturing and related process expenses 2 596 96,209 (95,613) (99%)\nIntellectual property expenses 3 547 27,342 (26,795) (98%)\nTranslational science expenses 4 - 81,363 (81,363) (100%)\nExternal consultants expenses 5 27,919 89,733 (61,814) (69%)\nTotal Research and development $34,741 $569,713 $(534,972) (94%)\nNotes:\n(1) Clinical trials expenses include those costs associated with our clinical trial program which primarily included expenses related\nto the XRx-008 and XRx-101 projects.

The decrease in\nexternal consultants’ expenses in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023 was attributed to decreased activity associated with\ncompletion of the XRX-OXY-101 PK Clinical Trial versus the previous year quarter the activities were attributed to the initiation\nof the Company's bridging study and thereafter a single registration trial associated to the XRx-008 program in individuals.\nTravel - $18,335 (2023 - $138,416) – Travel decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nas compared with the 2023 period due to a decrease in travel to investor conferences.\nGain on derivative warrant liability - $164,756 (2023 - $nil) – During the period ended September 30,\n2024, the gain was primarily due to a decrease in the Company’s share price and a decrease in the\nremaining terms of the warrants which decrease the value of the derivative warrant liability. The warrants\nincluded in the units issued under the offering in Q1-2024 have an exercise price in CAD dollars and are\nconsidered a derivative financial liability as the exercise price is in a different currency than the functional\ncurrency of the entity. The warrants are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently remeasured at\nfair value with changes recognized through profit or loss.\n11\nComparison of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe Company realized a net cash outflow of $1,146,918 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to a cash outflow of $5,364,963 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The variances\nin the cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023 were\nas follows:\nOperating activities – Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwas $2,792,240 (2023 - $5,285,098). The cash used in operating activities decreased primarily due to\ndecreases in research and development costs incurred.\nInvesting activities – Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwas $34,888 (2023 - $36,568). The cash used was related to the acquisition of intangible assets and\nequipment during the periods.\nFinancing activities – Cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, was $1,672,472 (2023 – cash used of $48,791). The cash provided was mostly related to the non-\nbrokered offerings that took place in February and March raising gross proceeds of CAD $2,699,151\nthrough the issuance of 899,717 units at a subscription price of CAD $3.00 per unit.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $2,300,747 and working capital of $693,643\nas compared to a cash balance of $3,447,665 and working capital of $3,242,845 as at December 31, 2023.\nWorking capital included a non-cash component related to derivative warrant liability of $1,329,000\n(December 31, 2023 - $531,000) if this non-cash amount was excluded, working capital would have been\n$2,022,643 (December 31, 2023 - $3,773,845). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany closed two offerings that consisted of 899,717 common share units at CAD $3.00 per unit for\naggregate gross proceeds of CAD $2,699,151.\nAlthough there is no certainty, management is of the opinion that additional funding for its projects and\noperations can be raised as needed. The Company is subject to a number of risks associated with the\nsuccessful development of new products and their marketing and the conduct of its clinical studies and their\nresults. The Company will have to finance its research and development activities and its clinical studies.\nTo achieve the objectives in its business plan, the Company plans to raise the necessary capital and to\ngenerate revenues. It is anticipated that the products developed by the Company will require approval from\nthe FDA and equivalent organizations in other countries before their sale can be authorized. If the Company\nis unsuccessful in obtaining adequate financing in the future, corporate initiatives may be affected or\npostponed. The Company’s current cash burn is approximately $265,000 per month, however dependent\non the timing of financing activities, expenditures will be adjusted to ensure a 12 month cash runway.\nUSE OF FINANCING PROCEEDS\nThe proceeds that the Company has used have been for funding operations and general corporate\npurposes, which has included further research and development and manufacture of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and drug product to support clinical trials. The Company intends to continue to use the\nremaining net proceeds of the Offering, together with existing cash, for funding operations and general\ncorporate purposes, which may include further research and development, clinical trials, manufacture of\nactive pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product to support clinical trials and intends to use the proceeds\nin approximately the following proportions: XRx-008: 98%; XRx-101: 1%; XRx-225: 1%.\n12\nCOMMITMENTS\nThe Company has long-term arrangements with commitments that are not recognized as liabilities as at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nEmployment Agreements\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nManagement services – officers 321,000 321,000\nThe President, CEO and a director of the Company has a long-term employment agreement with the\nCompany.

Cash is classified as a financial asset at FVTPL, accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities and lease obligation are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost and\nderivative warrant liability is classified as a financial liability at FVTPL.\nThe fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values at September 30, 2024, due\nto their short-term nature.\nThe Company thoroughly examines the various financial instruments and risks to which it is exposed and\nassesses the impact and likelihood of those risks. These risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate\nrisk, market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Where material, these risks are reviewed and monitored by\nthe Board of Directors\nThere have been no changes in any risk management policies since December 31, 2023.\nCapital Management\nThe Company defines capital that it manages as shareholders’ equity. The Company manages its capital\nstructure in order to have funds available to support its research and development and sustain the future\ndevelopment of the business. When managing capital, the Company’s objective is to ensure the entity\ncontinues as a going concern as well as to maintain optimal returns to shareholders and benefits for other\nstakeholders. Management adjusts the capital structure as necessary in order to support its activities.\n14\nThe Company includes the following items in its managed capital as at the following periods:\nEquity is comprised of: September 30, December 31\n2024 2023\n$ $\nShare capital 17,870,948 17,056,535\nReserves 5,581,279 5,468,257\nObligation to issue shares 24,746 24,746\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (52,605) (52,605)\nDeficit (21,290,788) (17,854,907)\nSince inception, the Company’s objective in managing capital is to ensure sufficient liquidity to finance its\nresearch and development activities, general and administrative expenses, expenses associated with\nintellectual property protection and its overall capital expenditures. There were no changes during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The Company is not exposed to external requirements by regulatory\nagencies regarding its capital.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE DATA\nThe Company has an unlimited number of unauthorized common shares without par value.\nType of Security Common shares\nAs of November 14, 2024 (number)\nIssued and outstanding 3,223,565\nStock options 134,763\nShare purchase warrants 3,371,845\nFully diluted shares outstanding 6,730,173\nRISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS\nAn investment in the Company is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Accordingly, prospective\ninvestors should carefully consider the specific risk factors set out below, in addition to the other information\ncontained in this MD&A, before making any decision to invest in the Company. The Directors consider the\nfollowing risks and other factors to be the most significant for potential investors in the Company, but the\nrisks listed do not necessarily comprise all those associated with an investment in the Company and are\nnot set out in any particular order of priority. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the\nDirectors may also have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. If any of the following risks actually\noccur, the Company’s business, financial condition, capital resources, results or future operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected. In such a case, the price of the common shares could decline, and investors\nmay lose all or part of their investment.\nFor additional discussion on XORTX’s risks, refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual\nInformation Form and the Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the “Forward Looking\nStatements” section of this MD&A.\nSpeculative Nature of Investment Risk\nAn investment in the common shares of the Company carries a high degree of risk and should be\nconsidered as a speculative investment by purchasers. The Company has limited cash reserves, a limited\noperating history, has not paid dividends, and is unlikely to pay dividends in the immediate or near future.\nThe Company is in the development stage. Operations are not yet sufficiently established such that the\nCompany can mitigate the risks associated with planned activities.\n15\nLimited Operating History\nThe Company has no present prospect of generating revenue from the sale of products. The Company is\ntherefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization,\ncash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of revenues.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders’\ninvestment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations.\nNegative Cash Flow for the Foreseeable Future\nThe Company has a no history of earnings or cash flow from operations. The Company does not expect to\ngenerate material revenue or achieve self-sustaining operations for several years, if at all. To the extent\nthat the Company has negative cash flow in future periods, the Company may need to allocate a portion of\nits cash reserves to fund such negative cash flow.\nReliance on Management\nThe success of the Company is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith\nof its management. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining\nthe services of key employees, these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees.\nAny loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, operating results or financial condition.\nClinical trials for potential drug candidates will be expensive and time consuming, and their\noutcomes uncertain.\nBefore the Company can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any drug candidate or attract\nmajor pharmaceutical companies with which to collaborate, it will be required to complete extensive clinical\ntrials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Clinical trials are expensive and are difficult to design and\nimplement. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming and can often be subject to unexpected delays.\nThe timing and completion of clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes,\nincluding but not limited to: inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in\nclinical trials; delays arising from collaborative partnerships; delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to\ncommence a study, or government intervention to suspend or terminate a study; delays, suspensions or\ntermination of clinical trials by the applicable institutional review board or independent ethics board\nresponsible for overseeing the study to protect research subjects; delays in identifying and reaching\nagreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites; slow rates of patient recruitment and\nenrollment; uncertain dosing issues; inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow clinical\nprotocols; variability in the number and types of subjects available for each study and resulting difficulties\nin identifying and enrolling subjects who meet trial eligibility criteria; scheduling conflicts; difficulty in\nmaintaining contact with subjects after treatment, resulting in incomplete data; unforeseen safety issues or\nside effects; lack of efficacy during clinical trials; reliance on clinical research organizations to efficiently\nand properly conduct clinical trials in accord with contracted arrangements and regulations, or other\nregulatory delays.\nRisks Related to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates the approval of therapeutics and the FDA notification and approval\nprocess requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the Company cannot be certain that\nany approvals for its products will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Foreign jurisdictions have similar\ngovernment regulatory bodies and requirements that the Company must meet prior to selling products in\nthose jurisdictions.\nThe Company must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, shifts, changes and difficulties frequently\nencountered with companies whose businesses are regulated by various federal, state and local\ngovernments. The health care, wellness, workers’ compensation and similar companies are subject to a\n16\nvariety of regulatory requirements and the regulatory environment is ever changing particularly with recent\nlegislation, the full impact of which is not yet understood as regulations have not been issued. Failure to\nfollow applicable regulatory requirements will have a materially negative impact on the business of the\nCompany. Furthermore, future changes in legislation cannot be predicted and could irreparably harm the\nbusiness of the Company.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nThe Company could be adversely affected if it does not adequately protect its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company regards its marks, rights, and trade secrets and other intellectual property rights as critical\nto its success. To protect its investments and the Company’s rights in these various intellectual properties,\nit may rely on a combination of patents, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and\nconfidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its employees, clients, strategic\npartners, acquisition targets and others to protect proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that the\nsteps taken by the Company to protect proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe\nor misappropriate the Company’s copyrights, trademarks and similar proprietary rights, or that the Company\nwill be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce rights. In addition, although\nthe Company believes that its proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others,\nthere can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company. Such\nclaims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial\nresources.\nThe Company will rely on trade secrets to protect technology where it does not believe patent protection is\nappropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. While commercially reasonable efforts to\nprotect trade secrets will be used, strategic partners, employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and\nother advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose information to competitors.\nIf the Company is not able to defend patents or trade secrets, then it will not be able to exclude competitors\nfrom developing or marketing competing products, and the Company may not generate enough revenue\nfrom product sales to justify the cost of development of products and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nThe results of preclinical studies or initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future\nfavorable results.\nPreclinical tests and initial clinical trials are primarily designed to test safety and to understand the side\neffects of drug candidates and to explore efficacy at various doses and schedules. Success in preclinical\nor animal studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large-scale efficacy trials will be\nsuccessful nor does it predict final results. Favorable results in early trials may not be repeated in later\nones.\nDifficulty to Forecast\nThe Company must rely largely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not\ngenerally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the industry. A failure in the demand for its\nproducts to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nLitigation\nThe Company may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which\ncould adversely affect its business. Should any litigation in which the Company becomes involved be\ndetermined against the Company such a decision could adversely affect the Company’s ability to continue\noperating and the market price for the Company’s common shares. Even if the Company is involved in\nlitigation and wins, litigation can redirect significant Company resources.\n17\nCommercial success of the Company will depend in part on not infringing upon the patents and proprietary\nrights of other parties and enforcing its own patents and proprietary rights against others. The research and\ndevelopment programs will be in highly competitive fields in which numerous third parties have issued\npatents and pending patent applications with claims closely related to the subject matter of the Company’s\nprograms. The Company is not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or claims by third\nparties that its technologies or methods infringe on their intellectual property.\nWhile it is the practice of the Company to undertake pre-filing searches and analyses of developing\ntechnologies, it cannot guarantee that it has identified every patent or patent application that may be\nrelevant to the research, development, or commercialization of its products. Moreover, it cannot assure that\nthird parties will not assert valid, erroneous, or frivolous patent infringement claims.\nUninsurable Risks\nThe business of the Company may not be insurable or the insurance may not be purchased due to high\ncost. Should such liabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in\nincreasing costs and a decline in the value of the Company.\nThe market price of the Company’s common shares may be subject to wide price fluctuations.\nThe market price of the Company’s common shares may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to\nmany factors, including variations in the operating results of the Company and its subsidiary, divergence in\nfinancial results from analysts’ expectations, changes in earnings estimates by stock market analysts,\nchanges in the business prospects for the Company and its subsidiary, general economic conditions,\nlegislative changes, and other events and factors outside of the Company’s control. In addition, stock\nmarkets have from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, as well as\ngeneral economic and political conditions, could adversely affect the market price for the Company’s\ncommon shares.\nDividends\nThe Company has no earnings or dividend record and does not anticipate paying any dividends on the\ncommon shares in the foreseeable future.\nDilution\nThe financial risk of the Company’s future activities will be borne to a significant degree by purchasers of\nthe common shares. If the Company issues common shares from its treasury for financing purposes, control\nof the Company may change and purchasers may suffer additional dilution.\nRapid Technological Change\nThe business of the Company is subject to rapid technological changes. Failure to keep up with such\nchanges may adversely affect the business of the Company. The Company is subject to the risks of\ncompanies operating in the medical and healthcare business. The market in which the Company competes\nis characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and\nproduct announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. As a result,\nan investment in the stocks of the Company is highly speculative and is only suitable for investors who\nrecognize the high risks involved and can afford a total loss of investment.\nRisks Associated with Acquisitions\nIf appropriate opportunities present themselves, the Company may acquire businesses, technologies,\nservices or products that the Company believes are strategic. The Company currently has no\nunderstandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any other material acquisition and no other\nmaterial acquisition is currently being pursued. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able\n18\nto identify, negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully, or to integrate such acquisitions with its\ncurrent business. The process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into the\nCompany may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant\nmanagement attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of the Company’s\nbusiness. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence\nof debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets,\nwhich could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. Any such future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might\nrequire the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms\nfavorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.\nEconomic Environment\nThe Company’s operations could be affected by the economic context should the unemployment level,\ninterest rates or inflation reach levels that influence consumer trends and consequently, impact the\nCompany’s future sales and profitability.\nGlobal Economy Risk\nThe ongoing economic problems and downturn of global capital markets has generally made the raising of\ncapital by equity or debt financing more difficult. Access to financing has been negatively impacted by the\nongoing global economic risks. As such, the Company is subject to liquidity risks in meeting its development\nand future operating cost requirements in instances where cash positions are unable to be maintained or\nappropriate financing is unavailable. These factors may impact the Company’s ability to raise equity or\nobtain loans and other credit facilities in the future and on terms favorable to the Company. If uncertain\nmarket conditions persist, the Company’s ability to raise capital could be jeopardized, which could have an\nadverse impact on the Company’s operations and the trading price of the Company’s Shares on the stock\nexchange.\nInternational Conflict\nInternational conflict and other geopolitical tensions and events, including war, military action, terrorism,\ntrade disputes and international responses thereto have historically led to, and may in the future lead to,\nuncertainty or volatility in financial markets and supply chains. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022\nhas led to sanctions being levied against Russia by the international community and may result in additional\nsanctions or other international action, any of which may have a destabilizing effect on supply chain\ndisruptions which may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of\noperations. The extent and duration of the current Russia-Ukraine conflict and related international action\ncannot be accurately predicted at this time and the effects of such conflict may magnify the impact of the\nother risks identified in this document, including those relating to global financial conditions. The situation\nis rapidly changing and unforeseeable impacts, including on our shareholders and counterparties on which\nwe rely and transact, may materialize and may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risk Exposures\nThe Company may have financial risk exposure to varying degrees relating to the currency of each of the\ncountries where it operates. The level of the financial risk exposure related to currency and exchange rate\nfluctuations will depend on the Company’s ability to hedge such risk or use another protection mechanism.\nAttracting and keeping senior management and key scientific personnel\nThe success of the Company depends on the continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly\nqualified management, clinical, and scientific personnel and to develop and maintain important relationships\nwith leading academic institutions, companies, and thought leaders. Allen Davidoff, the Company’s CEO,\nexercises significant control over the day-to-day affairs of the Company. The Company depends on Dr.\n19\nDavidoff to engage with third parties and contractors to operate the business.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe view our operations and manage our business in one segment, which is the development and\ncommercialization of biopharmaceuticals, initially focused on the treatment of progressive kidney disease.\nTREND INFORMATION\nOther than as disclosed elsewhere we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments,\nor events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income from continuing\noperations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not\nnecessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition.\nMANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company’s management is responsible for the presentation and preparation of the financial statements\nand the MD&A. The MD&A have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities\nregulators, including National Instrument 51-102 of the Canadian Securities Administrators.\nThe financial statements and information in the MD&A necessarily include amounts based on informed\njudgments and estimates of the expected effects of current events and transactions with appropriate\nconsideration to materiality. In addition, in preparing the financial information, we must interpret the\nrequirements described above, make determinations as to the relevancy of information included, and make\nestimates and assumptions that affect reported information. The MD&A also includes information regarding\nthe impact of current transactions and events, sources of liquidity and capital resources, operating trends,\nrisks and uncertainties. Actual results in the future may differ materially from our present assessment of\nthis information because future events and circumstances may not occur as anticipated.\nINTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information\nrequired to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings, or other reports filed or\nsubmitted by it under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the securities legislation and include controls and procedures designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports\nfiled or submitted under securities legislation is accumulated and communicated to the Company's\nmanagement, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal controls over financial reporting\nInternal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\nManagement is also responsible for the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in\norder to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nThe Company's internal controls over financial reporting include policies and procedures that: pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndisposition of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are\nbeing made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Company; and\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\n20\ndisposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAs at September 30, 2024, there has not been any material change to disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal controls over financial reporting for the period. Management, including the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the\nCompany's disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that the\nCompany's disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in\nNational Instrument 52-109 – Certification of Disclosure in Issuer's Annual and Interim Filings, are effective\nto achieve the purpose for which they have been designed. Because of their inherent limitations, internal\ncontrols over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The control framework used to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting is the\n2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company's design of internal controls and procedures over financial\nreporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting during the period covered by this MD&A.\n21"
