Good morning. Very glad to be with everybody this morning. It’s always a great\ntime at this annual meeting to look back and reflect on some of the successes and also the challenges of\nthe past year. I think 2023, in fact for the industry, had its share of challenges. It was a much more\ntumultuous operating year for the industry than I think normal. While things do seem to have settled\ndown somewhat relative to where we stood a year ago on this day, there are still a number of headwinds\nthat the industry and the economy face.\nI think you’ll see, though, that your company has navigated these choppy waters of the past year with a\ngood deal of success. The theme of our annual report this year is about just this: being resilient in\nchallenging times. To me, the theme highlights the steady way that this bank has operated in both good\ntimes and in bad. We strive every day to make decisions for the long-term best interests of our\nshareholders, our customers, and our team members who choose to make a career at Commerce. And I\nthink that long-term view has served us well particularly in times of volatility and uncertainty.\nSo, I’m happy to be able to look back on this previous year and to highlight some of the ways that I think\nyour company has shown resilience while keeping our gaze down the field and our sights on the future.\nFor more still, please do take a look at our annual report that you can find on our investor website.\nI would just offer the usual caution about forward-looking statements that I may make today. And with\nthat we can get into the main presentation.\nIn our time today, I’ll touch on four areas, broadly. First, I am going to talk about Commerce at a high level.\nNext, I’ll talk about what we see in the economy and the banking industry. Looking ahead we’ll talk about\nhow we think Commerce is positioned against this backdrop. I’ll wrap up by touching on our Company’s\nperformance relative to the industry, including a few thoughts on the playing field that we find ourselves\non in 2024.\nSo first just to talk about the bank itself at a high level. Here’s the Commerce Bank on a page, a primer on\nwho we are. We’re about midway through our 159th year in business. We have a footprint which is focused\nin the middle of the country, though we have certain businesses particularly in the payments area that\nspan the entire country, and we serve wealth customers in nearly every state.\nYou can see some of our end of year numbers on the right side of this page. These are reflective of end of\n2023. At about $32 billion dollars in assets, we’d be the 41st largest bank by assets in the country. We are\nactually the 22nd largest by market capitalization at the end of the year. As we’ve discussed in the past,\nthe reason for that strong enterprise valuation relative to our balance sheet is that we make money in a\nnumber of ways that do not rely so heavily on our balance sheet. We have a large B2B and consumer\npayments business. We have quite a significant wealth management business. You can see we oversee\njust shy of $70 billion dollars in trust assets on behalf of our customers so that would rank us among the\ntop 20 banks in the country.\n- 3 -\nWe’re also a very liquid, well capitalized, and safe bank. That’s not always something that is fashionable,\nbut I think it’s something that our customers and our investors appreciate and expect, and certainly that\nposture has served us well this last year, when we’ve seen some bank failures and the consequences of\ninadequate risk management.\nHere we just have a refresher on the bank, how we organize and how we go to market. We like to think\nof ourselves, and describe ourselves, as a super-community bank and to us that means, combining the\nbest of both small and big banks. We really strive to have the capabilities, the products, the sophisticated\nadvice that you might find at a larger bank, but we want to deliver these things in the context of deep\nrelationships and excellent customer service. Our bankers are empowered to take care of their customers,\nthey’re deeply engaged in their communities. I would say sometimes this organizational model can be a\ntough thing to pull off, but I think looking back it’s been well worth the effort. This has been a pretty\ndistinctive niche, operating like this, for us and I think the formula has been a good one over time. You\ncan see that in any number of metrics if you want to look at our engaged employees, our satisfied\ncustomers and our shareholder returns over time.\nTalking today with our shareholders, I would just note that our investors do tend to own our stock over\nthe long term, and they do that because they understand that our story is one of a steady execution over\ntime. I’ll flag here just a handful of the things that we think distinguishes Commerce in the eyes of\ninvestors. We have diverse revenues sources. Typically, something like 35-40% of our revenues come from\nfees. Again, with particular strength in payments and in wealth. We’ve historically had very core, stable\ndeposit funding that's true both in the consumer and commercial side and I think you can see that stability\nhas been evidenced this past year. We’ve also had very strong credit metrics over time, and we have\nample capital and earnings to support regular dividends. In fact, we’ve increased those dividends for 56\nyears straight. Putting these things together, we’ve found that over time it’s been possible to provide\nsteady shareholder returns while also investing for the long-term health of the franchise.\nNow underpinning all of this is our team and what we think of as a pretty distinctive culture. It’s something\nthat we talk about a lot around here and something that we take time to really actively shape. So, in that\nsense our culture really is an evolving thing. It is expressed in our shared values, in our shared language,\nand a common understanding of our direction that allows for our teammates to communicate and execute\neffectively on our business model. Put simply, our culture is how we win. It’s really the foundational\nstrength of this institution.\nPart of our culture has to do with the way that we support our communities and the way that we support\neach other. When we measure the number of teammates that report as being both enabled and engaged\nin their jobs, we consistently outpace high performing norms by about 10 percentage points according to\nKorn Ferry, who is our survey administrator. This sort of engagement really is a key competitive advantage.\nIt allows us to do a better job of retaining top talent and also attracting new team members who can hit\nthe ground running in a productive and supportive environment.\nA lot of banks make headlines through financial investment and sponsorship in communities. We invest\nquite a bit of financial capital like these banks, but we also invest our time which is something that I’m\nequally proud of. Our teammates serve on the board of more than 500 non-profit organizations in our\ncommunities, and we actually offer paid time off to teammates who want to offer up community service.\nThe bank has received a CRA rating of “Outstanding” for 28 years now.\n- 4 -\nYou can see here some recent recognition for the bank. We try not to read a lot of our own press clippings\nbut surveying this list, I do think you can at least get an impression for the way that we serve all our\nstakeholders, our shareholders, our customers, and our teammates.\nI’ve got just a couple of slides now about the economy and the banking environment. I’m going to focus\non 2023 for the most part because that’s been the backdrop of our performance we are discussing today.\nOf course, the big story this past year was the battle to contain inflation and navigate the transition that\nwe’ve made to higher interest rates, while also still sustaining some bit of economic growth in the\neconomy. I think that was the Feds central challenge. I think frankly most of us were a little surprised at\nthe resilient economy, given if you think back a year ago, all the modeling and prognostications of a\nrecession, but employment remained strong through the year. And during the year we actually made a\ngood deal of progress on inflation although obviously we have a ways to go on that and that last mile may\nwell prove to be the most challenging.\nSo, for banks, a lot of this has been, this economic news has been good for earnings. Credit losses did not\nreally materialize in a big way, the consumer for the most part has remained strong, fee-based businesses\nhave mostly performed. The higher for longer interest rate environment, I will say, it did compound mark-\nto-market losses in asset portfolios and so that made it difficult for banks to build capital. So, I think as a\nconsequence you saw some muting of lending appetites among banks. Of course, there’s a lot of focus on\ncommercial real estate right now and so I think you are seeing lenders be a little more selective there. The\nindustry, like everyone else, is dealing with elevated wage costs and when you put that together with\nsome pretty slow revenue growth, I think it follows that banks really are trying to focus on efficiencies\nwherever possible and you’re seeing a lot of announcements to that affect.\nOkay and given that backdrop of the economy and industry, I’ll touch here on our strategic posture.\nFor those of you that have followed our franchise for a long time, you’ll see there’s a lot of continuity, I\nthink, in this strategy. So, starting at the most basic level, in general, we think about our strategic posture\nas striking a balance between two things. The first is continuously improving the functioning of our now\n158-year-old “core bank” and second making some innovative bets and investing in areas where we think\nthat we can drive long-term growth in areas with good risk adjusted profitability.\nIf we get the continuous improvement part right in our core bank – getting more efficient, improving our\ngo-to-market approach, building the best team and culture that we can – you know we find that it actually\nbuys us the earnings and the capital to be able to place these longer term bets for the company that you\nsee on the right side of the page. In our culture we call these bets “blue chips” for the company, and you\ncan see some of those blue chips enumerated here on the right.\nWe are making a lot of digital investments these days, and we’re doing this because this is increasingly\nthe way that customers are telling us they want to do business with us. You can see the progress in our\nrapidly improving digital offerings. You know digital can be a lot of things. I think of it really as being the\ncustomer front door into the bank. We had dozens of customer facing digital releases across our consumer\nand our commercial platforms in 2023. And while I talk about this progress, I also want to note that we\nare focused at the same time on maintaining the human connection in moments that matter, whether\nthat connection comes in person or through these new digital channels. An example of this would be our\nCommerceConnect® app or our private banking app, where customers on their phone are able to interact\ndirectly with their dedicated banker who I would case in point is a real person with whom customers can\nbuild a relationship.\n- 5 -\nIf digital is our front door, I’m also happy to note some of the significant investments that we are making\nin the back of the house, so to speak, in an array of core applications. In 2022, we completed the\ninstallation and stabilization of our new core deposit system, working in partnership Temenos. Building\non that momentum, we have an ambitious, but I think deliberately staged pipeline of core application\nupgrades – many of which you can see on this page, in areas like payments, lending systems, sales and\nservice platforms. This modernization work is going to make us a whole lot more efficient over time and\nit’s also going to make possible an exciting array of new customer products and service options.\nI’ll spend a few minutes now just walking through our three customer segments of our business, beginning\nwith consumer here. You can see just a brief snapshot of the size of our business. We currently serve more\nthan 800 thousand households representing about $12.5 billion dollars in deposits and a little less than\n$4 billion dollars in loans on our balance sheet. I would point out that these numbers exclude loans and\ndeposits in our trust company or our wealth management segment. We service these customers through\na network of about 140 branches, about 270 ATM but increasingly as you can see at the bottom of the\npage, our emphasis is on growing our digital channel. Our app has a 4.7-star rating, which would put us\non about the same footing as best-in-class banks.\nNow on the Commercial side, you can see here a snapshot of our loans and our deposit footings. You can\nalso see the revenue associated with this segment, which is quite significant in the bank’s overall makeup.\nOur capabilities in the commercial space span, I think, a broad array of products and services. Our goal\nreally is to be the full-service partner to any commercial customer, and to us that means helping them not\nonly credit but also with deposits, and any services that a company may require.\nI talked about the importance of our commercial payments franchise, here’s a little more color on that\nbusiness. It’s an area where certainly we compete against the largest banks and of course increasingly\nFinTechs, but it’s one where we’ve had a good deal of success. We really like this business because of the\nvalue that it brings to our customers, as well as the risk and return characteristics that it delivers to our\nfranchise. There’s money to be made here in ways that doesn’t really rely on our balance sheet too heavily.\nNow within our payments business, healthcare is our single largest customer vertical. You can get a sense\nhere for how this business really is national in scale. Just on the hospital side, we work with more than\n500 hospitals now across 48 states. We have solutions that address really the entire revenue cycle for\nproviders, and also improve the patient experience, which we know is something very important to\nproviders. The services market in healthcare, of course, very crowded with tech players, but we’re finding\nthat our identity as an innovative but stable bank, one that is focused on this vertical, has been pretty\ndistinctive and I think compelling.\nA large part of our profitable growth in recent years has come from what we call our “expansion markets”,\nwhich are markets where we’ve planted a flag in the last 15 years or so. You can see the dots on the map\nthat reflect those markets. On the left side of the page, you can also get a sense for the increase in loan\nbalances generated out of these markets over time. But just as important really is the fee growth, which\nhas actually outpaced loan growth in this window of time. So, we are excited about the prospects for the\nfuture here to date it’s been mostly about projecting our commercial business line into these markets,\nbut we see a lot of opportunity related to wealth management in these areas as well, so that’s something\nwe will be emphasizing in the future.\n- 6 -\nSpeaking of the wealth management business, I’ll just close out our segment talk by talking about our\nthird and final business segment, the wealth management business. You can see where we stack up\nagainst bank owned trust companies and again, this is an area where we are really outsized relative to our\nbalance sheet. As of end of the year, we oversaw about $70 billon in client assets, about 60% of which we\nactively manage. This is a business with, I’d say, very nice financial return characteristics. It’s relatively low\nrisk and it’s relatively steady. And most importantly, it’s complementary to everything else that we do for\nour customers – those could be families, those could be commercial customers, other institutions. It really\nallows us to build, I think, deep and enduring relationships across the bank.\nYou can see some of the key growth initiatives laid out on the left side of the page here. As I mentioned,\nwe’re particularly excited about our expansion plans, matter of fact we’ve recently committed to growing\nour wealth teams in both Dallas and in Naples, Florida.\nSo now I’ll just close out with a recap of our performance in 2023. Also share just a few thoughts about\nhow we are positioned in the current environment.\nYou can see some of our key financial metrics for the previous year and I think on the whole they were\nreally quite strong. Our net income came in at about $477 million, or $3.64 per share. Returns on assets\nand equity were 1.49% and 17.9%, respectively, and those ranked among really the highest in our peer\nset. There was of course downward pressure on deposits in 2023 – I think we all know that story pretty\nwell just from following the industry – but we are fortunate our strong liquidity position allowed us to\ngrow loans nonetheless, and increasing margins meant that we were actually able to grow net interest\nincome on the year. You can see that our long-term returns remain strong, outpacing the bank index by\nmore than 5 percentage points per year if you look back over that 20-year period.\nHere’s a little more detail on the earnings for 2023. I think the big story here was pretty solid revenue\ngrowth that was offset by really higher than normal expense growth. That’s true on the expense side both\nbecause of elevated wages and benefits, which I think is something all companies are dealing with right\nnow, but also exacerbated by some one-time expenses, most notably the special FDIC assessment that\nwas levied in the 4th quarter of the year.\nI do like to point out at this meeting the diversity of our revenues and the really superior mix of fee income\nrelative to our peers. You can see that in the pie chart on the left where, particularly, in our card and our\nwealth management businesses, are that revenue delta between our peers does really stand out. And the\nreason that’s important is because again, these businesses offer relatively steady and good risk-adjusted\nreturns, meaning that we can generate good overall earnings without reaching for undue risk.\nSpeaking of risk taking, I think you can see historically our conservative posture, on this page. You can see\nwhat our credit performance has looked like over time. Of course, the industry really had not taken much\nin the way of losses in recent years but at some point, I think credit quality really is going to matter again.\nThere’s a lot more scrutiny in this area and we are I think underwriting with that correction in the market\nin mind.\nThis posture, in terms of our diversity of revenues to our credit, has served us well over time. In fact, you\ncan see here on our returns on assets we have tended to outperform during recessionary periods.\nWe’re still in a very strong position relative to our peers on capital and liquidity, with solid core funding,\na lot of lending capacity, a low loan to deposit ratio. The numbers that you see here are year-end numbers.\n- 7 -\nAnd kind of summarizing that relative performance to peers, here you can see how we stack up on both\nreturns and safety, so looking at returns on assets, returns on equity, our capital levels and our problem\nloans. So really, we’re among the top two in every category relative to peers – and if you’re interested\nyou can see exactly who those peers are if you read the footnote at the bottom of this page.\nWe did release earnings for the first quarter just yesterday, so these numbers are hot off the press. We\ncame in at $.86 per share on the quarter and I think the underlying news here is really good. We were\nable to show an increase in our net interest margin and also in our net interest income. Really, I think the\nstrength of our deposit franchise showed very well here. And even with higher interest rates, which for\nthe industry, is driving more AOCI losses on paper, we were able to grow our capital ratios. You can see\nthat in the last bullet point related to our tangible common ratio. So, you know really, I think a very good\nstart to the year, one that we are very happy with.\nI won’t go into a lot of detail here but just provide this information on liquidity management and capital.\nI think it is important to keep this in front of investors, you know given last year, we’re making sure to\nreally tell our story on this. I think you can see we’re in very good shape and we are well positioned in a\nhigher for longer interest rate environment.\nReally briefly, here’s just a visual on that deposit stability that I was describing in the aftermath of what\nwas really the reset in March of 2023. You can see after that our deposit trend has been pretty flat and\nthat is a good thing.\nSo, I will just close here by saying what I always do in this meeting, which is that we are aware this is a\nlong race that we are running and that your Commerce team really is focused on delivering value over the\nlong term. Our past couple of years have certainly had some challenges to contend with as the market has\nsettled into the higher interest rate environment, as we’ve navigated an inflationary environment and as\nwe brace for the possibility of recession and credit losses. You know a lot of these things are near term\nchallenges, and as always, we’re going to do our best to navigate them but at the same time we want to\nstay focused on the long-term health of this franchise. Again, this year marked the 56th consecutive year\nof dividend growth for the company. I’m not aware of another bank with that sort of track record.\nI’ll close here just by saying we know our job here is really to work on behalf of our shareholders. You can\nsee our long-term track record on returns remains strong. I think that long-term track record is really\nwhat matters most. We are optimistic about the future. Our goal is to constantly improve this franchise,\nto innovate, to generate growth over time but to do it without taking on undue risk. So, I will conclude\njust by thanking everyone listening on this call. Thanking our shareholders for the confidence that you\nplace in our team every day. We’re focused on the future. We’re grateful, very much so, for the support\nthat you give us.\nAnd with that, Mr. Chairman that concludes my remarks. I’d be happy to respond to any questions if there\nare any.\nDavid Kemper, Chairman:\nThis is our question-and-answer period, we invite any questions shareholders might have for the\nCompany, for John, or for KPMG. Shareholders may submit questions online by clicking on the Q&A tab in\nthe upper right corner of the screen. In the event any questions presented online are not answered at this\n- 8 -\nmeeting, such questions will be responded to promptly after the meeting by our Investor Relations group\nfor the Company or by KPMG, as appropriate.\n[PAUSE]\nDavid Kemper, Chairman:\nI don’t think we have any questions.\nPeggy Rowe, Secretary:\nWe have none.\nDavid Kemper, Chairman:\nOkay, so we don’t have any questions. Thank you everybody for being here. That concludes our meeting,\nand we will close our annual meeting. Thank you.\n- 9 -"
