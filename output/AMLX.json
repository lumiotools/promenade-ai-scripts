We recently reported positive topline data from our Phase 2 HELIOS clinical trial in people living with Wolfram syndrome that show AMX0035 resulted in meaningful improvements across multiple measures of disease progression as well as sustained improvement over time. We plan to engage with the FDA and other stakeholders to inform our Phase 3 program in Wolfram,” said Joshua Cohen and Justin Klee, Co-CEOs of Amylyx. “Additionally, we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 program for our lead asset avexitide in post-bariatric hypoglycemia in the first quarter of next year and remain on track to report interim data from our Phase 2b/3 ORION clinical trial of AMX0035 in progressive supranuclear palsy in mid-2025. With cash runway into 2026, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on these milestones as we continue our critical work in neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions.” \n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Updates:**\n\n  * **Announced positive topline data for all 12 participants in the Phase 2 HELIOS clinical trial, a single-site, single-arm, open-label trial of AMX0035 (sodium phenylbutyrate [PB] and taurursodiol [TURSO, also known as ursodoxicoltaurine]) in adults living with Wolfram syndrome.** Wolfram syndrome is a rare, progressive, monogenic disease impacting approximately 3,000 people in the U.S. HELIOS showed improvement in pancreatic function, as measured by C-peptide response after 24 weeks of treatment with AMX0035, the trial’s primary efficacy endpoint, in contrast to the expected decrease in pancreatic function with disease progression. Similar overall improvements or stabilization were observed across all secondary endpoints, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), time in target glucose range assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and visual acuity. The safety profile of AMX0035 in HELIOS was consistent with prior safety data. The Company is engaging with stakeholders and plans to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to inform a Phase 3 program and expects to provide an update in 2025. \n\n\n  * **Acquired avexitide, a Phase 3-ready glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist with FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.** Avexitide has been evaluated in five clinical trials for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) and has also been studied in three clinical trials for congenital hyperinsulinism (HI), two indications characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In previous Phase 2 and Phase 2b studies in PBH, avexitide showed statistically significant reductions in hypoglycemia events. FDA guidance for industry combined with initial FDA feedback specific to the planned pivotal Phase 3 program of avexitide for PBH suggest that reduction in hypoglycemia events could be an endpoint to support approval following positive results from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. \n\n\n  * **Announced publication of data showing encouraging effects of AMX0035 on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of core Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration in the peer-reviewed medical journal**[** _Alzheimer’s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions_**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Falz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1002%2Ftrc2.12487&esheet=54148311&newsitemid=20241107293249&lan=en-US&anchor=Alzheimer%26%238217%3Bs+%26amp%3B+Dementia%3A+Translational+Research+%26amp%3B+Clinical+Interventions&index=2&md5=ba9bc6d683a934933ba16d55aa46e02a)**, a journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.** The exploratory analyses on CSF biomarkers from participants with AD from the Phase 2 PEGASUS clinical trial suggest that treatment with AMX0035 resulted in consistent changes in AD and neurodegeneration CSF biomarkers in participants with a broad range of disease severity. Findings from the exploratory analysis provide preliminary evidence that AMX0035 engages multiple pathological pathways related to neurodegeneration, including tau. \n\n\n  * **Presented the planned Phase 1 study design of AMX0114 in people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the 2024 Northeast ALS Consortium Annual Meeting. **The Phase 1 LUMINA clinical trial, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of AMX0114 in approximately 48 people living with ALS. Four dose levels of AMX0114 or placebo are planned to be examined sequentially starting with 12.5 mg. \n\n\n  * **Received clearance from Health Canada for the Company’s Clinical Trial Application for AMX0114 in people living with ALS. Amylyx plans to begin the LUMINA trial with a starting dose of 12.5 mg in Canada by the end of 2024 or in early 2025. **The Company also submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA for AMX0114. The FDA restricted dosing to an amount that is lower than the Company’s proposed starting dose of 12.5 mg and has requested additional information, which resulted in a clinical hold. Toxicology data from studies showed a greater than 10X safety margin at the starting dose of 12.5 mg based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) determined by independent toxicology firms. Amylyx is working to address FDA comments and believes the trial can be completed outside of the U.S. if needed. The Company expects early cohort data from LUMINA in 2025. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Expected Milestones:**\n\n  * **The Company plans to initiate the Phase 1 LUMINA clinical trial of AMX0114 in people living with ALS by the end of 2024 or in the beginning of 2025 in Canada.** AMX0114 is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting inhibition of calpain-2, a well-established target in a number of neurological diseases and a protease known to cleave many substrates including neurofilament, tau, and TDP43 proteins.Amylyx expects early cohort data from LUMINA in 2025. \n\n\n  * **Amylyx continues to expect initiation of its Phase 3 program for avexitide in PBH in the first quarter of 2025.** Topline data are anticipated in 2026. \n\n\n  * **Data from an interim analysis of the Phase 2b/3 ORION clinical trial of AMX0035 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) continue to be expected in mid-2025.** ORION is an operationally seamless Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. The Phase 2b portion will include approximately 100 people living with PSP. Amylyx plans to conduct an interim analysis in these participants through Week 24 and will use this data to inform a go/no-go decision on the Phase 3 portion of the trial in mid-2025. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Net product revenue:** Net product revenue was $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was related to adjustments to the Company’s gross-to-net accrual estimates for prior period sales of RELYVRIO® and ALBRIOZA™. As previously disclosed, on April 4, 2024, the Company announced that it had started a process with the FDA and Health Canada to voluntarily discontinue the marketing authorizations for RELYVRIO and ALBRIOZA and remove the product from the market based on topline results from the global Phase 3 PHOENIX trial, which did not meet its prespecified primary and secondary endpoints. \n\n**Cost of Sales:** Cost of sales were $0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and were related to estimated losses on firm commitments under commercial manufacturing supply agreements for AMX0035 that were established prior to the results from the Phase 3 PHOENIX trial. \n\n**Acquired in-process research and development:** Acquired in-process research and development expenses were $36.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to zero for the same period in 2023. The increase was due to the acquired in-process research and development assets of avexitide. \n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in clinical expenses and a decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs. The decrease in clinical expenses is primarily due to a decrease in spending on AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS following the topline data from the PHOENIX trial. The decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs was primarily related to a decrease in the number of employees following the restructuring plan announced on April 4, 2024. \n\n**SG &A Expenses:** Selling, general and administrative expenses were $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $48.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs and a decrease in consulting and professional services. The decrease in payroll and personnel-related costs was primarily related to a decrease in the number of employees as a result of the restructuring plan announced on April 4, 2024. The decrease in consulting and professional services was primarily due to a decrease in commercial sales and marketing activity as a result of removing RELYVRIO/ALBRIOZA from the markets in the U.S. and Canada based on topline results from the Phase 3 PHOENIX trial. \n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $72.7 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to net income of $20.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $234.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $309.8 million as of June 30, 2024. The Company expects cash runway into 2026. \n\n**Investor Conference Call Information**\n\nAmylyx’ management team will host a conference call today, November 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss financial results and provide an update on the business.

Avexitide is designed to bind to the GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic islet beta cells and block the effect of excessive GLP-1 to mitigate hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin secretion and stabilizing glucose levels. In PBH, excessive GLP-1 can lead to the hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent serious hypoglycemia events. In two Phase 2 PBH trials, avexitide demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in hypoglycemia events. These events can lead to autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that can have a devastating impact on daily living. \n\n**About AMX0035**\n\nAMX0035 is an oral, fixed-dose combination of sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and taurursodiol (TURSO; also known as ursodoxicoltaurine outside of the U.S.). AMX0035 was designed to slow or mitigate neurodegeneration by targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, two connected central pathways that lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. We believe that our proprietary combination of PB and TURSO and their complementary mechanisms of action will allow us to synergistically target abnormal cell death to better prevent neurodegeneration than treatment targeted at either mechanism of action alone. AMX0035 is being studied as a potential treatment for Wolfram syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy, two neurodegenerative diseases. \n\n**About AMX0114**\n\nAMX0114 is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to target the gene encoding calpain-2, a key contributor to the axonal (Wallerian) degeneration pathway. Axonal degeneration has been recognized as an important early contributor to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Calpain-2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS based on findings of elevated levels of calpain-2 and its cleavage products in postmortem ALS tissue, therapeutic benefit of calpain-2 modulation in animal models of ALS, and the role of calpain-2 in cleaving neurofilament, a broadly researched biomarker in ALS. Preclinical studies completed to date have shown that AMX0114 achieves potent, dose-dependent, and durable knockdown of _CAPN2_ mRNA expression and calpain-2 protein levels in human motor neurons. Moreover, in preclinical efficacy studies, treatment with AMX0114 reduced extracellular neurofilament light chain levels following neurotoxic insult in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human motor neurons, and improved survival of iPSC-derived human motor neurons harboring ALS-linked, pathogenic TDP-43 mutations. \n\n**About Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)**\n\nSymptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a condition that affects approximately 8% of people who have undergone bariatric surgery. It is characterized by an excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response, dysregulated secretion of insulin, and a rapid drop in blood sugar. PBH can cause serious hypoglycemia events associated with brain glucose starvation, known as neuroglycopenia, including impaired cognition, cardiac arrythmias, loss of consciousness, and seizures. PBH is associated with a high degree of disability and can result in major disruptions to life, including falls, motor vehicle accidents, and job and income loss. It is estimated that ~160,000 people are currently living with symptomatic PBH in the U.S., classifying it as an orphan condition. \n\n**About Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI)**\n\nCongenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a rare disease characterized by hypersecretion of insulin leading to severe, persistent hypoglycemia in infants and young children with limited therapeutic options. Common symptoms of congenital HI include lack of energy, irritability, lethargy, and excessive hunger. Repeated episodes of low blood glucose increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma. \n\n**About the HELIOS Trial**\n\nHELIOS ([NCT05676034](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05676034&esheet=54148311&newsitemid=20241107293249&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05676034&index=6&md5=0453abf836ca6c288513dd7010f32334)) is a 12-participant, single-site, single-arm, open-label, proof of biology, Phase 2 trial designed to study the effect of AMX0035 on safety and tolerability, and various measures of endocrinological, neurological, and ophthalmologic function in adult participants living with Wolfram syndrome. Participants in HELIOS receive AMX0035 for up to 96 weeks followed by a four-week safety follow-up. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed at Week 24 and at longer-term time points. \n\nIn September 2022, researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, including Dr. Urano, in collaboration with Amylyx, published preclinical data on AMX0035 in beta cell, neuronal cell, and mouse models of Wolfram syndrome in the peer-reviewed [Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finsight.jci.org%2Farticles%2Fview%2F156549%3Futm_content%3Dbufferb48f4%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com%26utm_campaign%3Dbuffer&esheet=54148311&newsitemid=20241107293249&lan=en-US&anchor=Journal+of+Clinical+Investigation+Insight&index=7&md5=2ebd912b9a490adf7477da834a8a1d3b). The FDA and the European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation to AMX0035 for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome in November 2020 and August 2024, respectively. \n\n**About Wolfram Syndrome**\n\nWolfram syndrome is a rare, monogenic neurodegenerative disease characterized by childhood-onset diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, and neurodegeneration. Common manifestations of Wolfram syndrome include diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, gradual vision loss leading to blindness, hearing loss, neurogenic bladder, difficulties with balance and coordination, and difficulty breathing. Genetic and experimental evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction is a critical pathogenic component of Wolfram syndrome. The prognosis of Wolfram syndrome is poor, and many people with the disease die prematurely with severe neurological disabilities. \n\n**About the ORION Trial**\n\nThe ORION trial ([NCT06122662](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT06122662%3Fterm%3D%2522progressive%2Bsupranuclear%2Bpalsy%2522%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&esheet=54148311&newsitemid=20241107293249&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06122662&index=8&md5=4c0793d95c4bc2da53eea10074761687)) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AMX0035 compared to placebo in people living with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). ORION was designed and planned in collaboration with key global academic leaders, people living with PSP and their caregivers, and industry advocacy organizations. \n\n**About PSP**\n\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a sporadic, rare, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, gait, balance, eye movements, swallowing, and speech. People living with PSP have a life expectancy of six to eight years after initial diagnosis. PSP typically begins in late-middle age and rapidly progresses over time. The disease affects approximately seven in 100,000 people worldwide, and there are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of PSP. \n\nPSP is characterized by abnormal tau inclusions and is consequently also known as a tauopathy. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, pathophysiologic changes underlying PSP are multifactorial, with several genetic and environmental factors likely contributing to tau dysfunction and aggregation. \n\nMultiple pathways, including genetic mutations, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the activation of unfolded protein response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have been implicated as contributors to tau dysfunction and aggregation. \n\n**About ALS**\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as motor neuron disease) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by motor neuron death in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neuron loss in ALS leads to deteriorating muscle function, the inability to move and speak, respiratory paralysis, and eventually, death. More than 90% of people with ALS have sporadic disease, showing no clear family history. ALS affects around 30,000 people in the U.S., and more than 30,000 people are estimated to be living with ALS in Europe (European Union and the United Kingdom). People living with ALS have a median survival of approximately two years from diagnosis. \n\n**About Amylyx Pharmaceuticals**\n\nAmylyx is committed to the discovery and development of new treatment options for communities with high unmet needs, including people living with serious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions. Since its founding, Amylyx has been guided by science to address unanswered questions, keeping communities at the heart and center of all decisions.

Wolfram syndrome is a rare, progressive, monogenic disease impacting approximately 3,000 people in the U.S. HELIOS showed improvement in pancreatic function, as measured by C-peptide response after 24 weeks of treatment with AMX0035, the study’s primary efficacy endpoint, in contrast to the expected decrease in pancreatic function with disease progression. Similar overall improvements or stabilization were observed across all secondary endpoints, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), time in target glucose range assessed by continuous glucose monitoring, and visual acuity. Patient- and physician-reported global impressions of change showed disease stability or improvement in all participants, meeting prespecified responder criteria. \n\nIn addition,longer-term data for all participants who completed Week 36 (n=10) and Week 48 (n=6) assessments showed sustained improvement over time. Data from HELIOS are being presented today at the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) 50th Annual Congress and during a webcast held by the Company. \n\n“The topline results of HELIOS indicate that AMX0035 has the potential to favorably change the trajectory of Wolfram syndrome, a progressive disease with no approved treatment options. These results build on the interim data presented in April of this year and show an improvement on multiple measures of pancreatic beta cell function, glycemic control, and vision,” said Fumihiko Urano, MD, PhD, Principal Investigator of the Phase 2 HELIOS clinical trial in Wolfram syndrome and the Samuel E. Schechter Professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “In addition, the participants who reached their Week 36 or Week 48 assessments demonstrated sustained improvement over baseline in C-peptide and HbA1c, which are objective laboratory measures of pancreatic function and glycemic control. These data are encouraging since Wolfram syndrome is a progressive disease.” \n\nThe analysis performed includes Week 24 data for all 12 participants and data for all participants who completed their Week 36 (n=10) and Week 48 (n=6) assessments as of the data cutoff. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial measures change from baseline in C-peptide, an established, objective laboratory measure of pancreatic beta cell function and a surrogate marker of glycemic control, assessed using a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) at Week 24. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include the assessment of other diabetic measures and other domains affected by the disease. \n\nHELIOS showed improvements in its primary endpoint of C-peptide response with a change from baseline to Week 24 at 120 minutes of +3.8 minutes*ng/mL (min*ng/mL) [standard error (SE): 19.3] in the Intent to Treat group (N=12) and +20.2 min*ng/mL [SE: 11.2] in the Per Protocol group (N=11). In addition, as outlined in the table below, participants receiving AMX0035 had improved glycemic control, as measured by markers of glucose metabolism; improved visual acuity in some participants, as measured by the Snellen chart; and improvement or stabilization of the disease, as measured by the Clinician Reported Global Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Reported Global Impression of Change (PGIC). \n\n**Week 24 ITT****(N=12)** |  **Week 24 Per Protocol † (N=11)** |  **Week 36 (n=10)** |  **Week 48 (n=6)**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**C-Peptide Response (min*ng/mL)**_mean change in AUC from baseline over_ _120 minutes_**††** |  +3.8 (SE: 19.3)  |  +20.2 (SE: 11.2)  |  +30.7 (SE: 9.7)  |  +36.7 (SE: 19.6)   \n**Hemoglobin A1c (%)**_change from baseline_ |  -0.09 (SE: 0.14)  |  -0.16 (SE: 0.13)  |  -0.35 (SE: 0.18)  |  -0.30 (SE: 0.31)   \n**Absolute Time in Target Glucose Range (%) **_change from baseline_ |  +5.2 (SE: 3.6)  |  +5.7 (SE: 3.9)  |  +12.3 (SE: 4.0)  |  +5.8 (SE: 8.9)   \n**Mean Exogenous Insulin Dose (units/kg/2 weeks)** _change from baseline_ |  -0.01  |  -0.01  |  0.01  |  0.02   \n**Visual Acuity (LogMAR)**_change from baseline_ |  -0.04 (SE: 0.06)  |  -0.04 (SE: 0.06)  |  Not Collected at this Time Point |  -0.11 (SE: 0.12)   \n**Clinician Report Global Impression of Change (CGIC)**_% meeting responder criteria_**†††** |  100%  |  100%  |  100%  |  100%   \n**Patient Reported Global Impression of Change (PGIC)**_% meeting responder criteria_**†††** |  100%  |  100%  |  100%  |  100%   \n  \n**†** Upon genetic review, one participant did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for HELIOS. This participant was found to have an autosomal recessive mutation confirmed to be pathogenic on just one of the two alleles and variant of uncertain significance on the other allele. This participant was within normal range for C-peptide, glycemic measures, and vision suggesting lack of typical Wolfram syndrome phenotype. Data presented with and without this participant who reached Week 24 (Intent to Treat and Per Protocol, respectively).   \n---  \n**††** In non-diabetic individuals, C-peptide peaks after a meal at approximately ~30 minutes; in Wolfram syndrome, peak is slower but generally was at or before 120 minutes in HELIOS. Area under the curve (AUC) over 120 minutes after meal challenge reflects beta cell response to a meal. Amylyx is currently planning to focus on 120-minute AUC as the C-peptide measure for future studies.   \n**†††** HELIOS defines a “responder” on both the CGIC and PGIC as no change or improvement given the progressive nature of Wolfram syndrome.   \n  \nThe safety profile of AMX0035 in HELIOS was consistent with prior safety data. AMX0035 was generally well-tolerated. All adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, and there were no serious AEs related to AMX0035 treatment. The most common AE was diarrhea. \n\n“These outcomes indicate that treatment with AMX0035 may result in meaningful improvements across multiple measures of disease progression,” said Camille L. Bedrosian, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Amylyx. “Wolfram syndrome is a progressive disease that is expected to consistently worsen over time, despite best supportive care, because of the underlying endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs due to mutations in the _WSF1_ gene. AMX0035 is believed to target both of these critical pathways. In addition, we are encouraged by the sustained improvement observed in all participants who completed Week 36 or Week 48 assessments, and we thank the Wolfram syndrome community for their continued collaboration and support in researching the potential of AMX0035. We continue to engage with stakeholders and plan to meet with the FDA to inform a Phase 3 program.” \n\nThe FDA and the European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation to AMX0035 for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome in November 2020 and August 2024, respectively. **HELIOS Interim Data in Wolfram Syndrome Virtual Webcast Details** Amylyx will host a virtual webcast with management and Fumihiko Urano, MD, PhD, Principal Investigator of the HELIOS clinical trial and the Samuel E.

Participants in HELIOS receive AMX0035 for up to 96 weeks followed by a four-week safety follow-up. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed at Week 24 and at longer-term time points. \n\nIn September 2022, researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, including Dr. Urano, in collaboration with Amylyx, published preclinical data on AMX0035 in beta cell, neuronal cell, and mouse models of Wolfram syndrome in the peer-reviewed [_Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight_](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finsight.jci.org%2Farticles%2Fview%2F156549%3Futm_content%3Dbufferb48f4%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com%26utm_campaign%3Dbuffer&esheet=54137376&newsitemid=20241017181662&lan=en-US&anchor=Journal+of+Clinical+Investigation+Insight&index=4&md5=ccc5da1b4c9dfb4dc0921fd7b5605e9a). \n\n**About Wolfram Syndrome** Wolfram syndrome is a rare, monogenic neurodegenerative disease characterized by childhood-onset diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, and neurodegeneration. Common manifestations of Wolfram syndrome include diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, central diabetes insipidus, sensorineural deafness, neurogenic bladder, and progressive neurologic difficulties. Genetic and experimental evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction is a critical pathogenic component of Wolfram syndrome. The prognosis of Wolfram syndrome is poor, and many people with the disease die prematurely with severe neurological disabilities. \n\n**About AMX0035** AMX0035 is an oral, fixed-dose combination of sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and taurursodiol (TURSO; also known as ursodoxicoltaurine outside of the U.S.). AMX0035 was designed to slow or mitigate neurodegeneration by targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, two connected central pathways that lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. We believe that our proprietary combination of PB and TURSO and their complementary mechanisms of action will allow us to synergistically target abnormal cell death to better prevent neurodegeneration than treatment targeted at either mechanism of action alone. AMX0035 is being studied as a potential treatment for Wolfram syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy, two neurodegenerative diseases. \n\n**About Amylyx Pharmaceuticals **Amylyx is committed to the discovery and development of new treatment options for communities with high unmet needs, including people living with serious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions.
