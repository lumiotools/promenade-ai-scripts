All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position,__our platform's ability to help protect enterprises from security exposure_ _,__business_ _strategy and plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements and represent our views as of the date of this press release. The words “anticipate,” \"believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of assumptions and risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the sections titled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,__2023_ _as well as other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, which are available on the SEC's website at sec.gov. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we are under no obligation to update these forward-looking statements subsequent to the date of this press release, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements._\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. We include these non-GAAP financial measures to present our financial performance using a management view and because we believe that these measures provide an additional comparison of our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\n\n_Calculated Current Billings:_ We define calculated current billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue recognized in a period plus the change in current deferred revenue in the corresponding period. We believe that calculated current billings is a key metric to measure our periodic performance. Given that most of our customers pay in advance (including multi-year contracts), but we generally recognize the related revenue ratably over time, we use calculated current billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers. We believe that calculated current billings, which excludes deferred revenue for periods beyond twelve months in a customer’s contractual term, more closely correlates with annual contract value and that the variability in total billings, depending on the timing of large multi-year contracts and the preference for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing, may distort growth in one period over another.\n\n_Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow:_ We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, for investment in our business and to make acquisitions. We believe that free cash flow is useful as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate cash. We define unlevered free cash flow as free cash flow plus cash paid for interest and other financing costs. We believe unlevered free cash flow is useful as a liquidity measure as it measures the cash that is available to invest in our business and meet our current debt obligations and future financing needs. However, given our debt obligations, non-cancelable commitments and other contractual obligations, unlevered free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses.\n\n_Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin:_ We define these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses, costs related to the intra-entity asset transfers resulting from the internal restructuring of legal entities, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction and integration expenses, as well as costs related to the intercompany transfer of acquired intellectual property. Restructuring expenses include non-ordinary course severance, employee related benefits, and other charges. We believe that the exclusion of these expenses provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies, which commonly exclude restructuring expenses.\n\n_Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share:_ We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP net loss, excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, including the applicable tax impacts. In addition, we exclude the tax impact and related costs of intra-entity asset transfers resulting from the internal restructuring of legal entities as well as deferred income tax benefits recognized in connection with acquisitions. We use non-GAAP net income to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\n_Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin:_ We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\n_Non-GAAP Sales and Marketing Expense, Non-GAAP Research and Development Expense and Non-GAAP General and Administrative Expense:_ We define these non-GAAP measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and costs related to intra-entity asset transfers resulting from the internal restructuring of legal entities.\n\n**TENABLE HOLDINGS, INC.****CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember

As we have grown our standalone cloud and Tenable One cloud customer base we have developed deep relationships and an understanding of what their ongoing needs are.\n  * The highly-intuitive user interface, and elegant integration across the different CNAPP use cases, enables our customers to better understand, prioritize and reduce risk. This unified cloud view will make it easy for security professionals of all cloud expertise levels to spot and quickly address risks.\n  * To bring state of the art cloud infrastructure entitlement management “CIEM” technology to our cloud solution.\n  * Mindshare: Ermetic’s strong team has extensive cloud security experience. We look forward to working with them to expand our offering even further.\n\n\n\nWhat does Ermetic do?\n\n  * Ermetic’s CNAPP is a unified and agentless solution that automates asset discovery, risk analysis, accelerated remediation and compliance. Elegant user experience minimizes complexity and speeds adoption.\n  * Ermetic solved one of the toughest problems in cloud security - identity and entitlements - first. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing human and service identities for cloud infrastructure.\n  * Ermetic visualizes all identities and entitlements and reveals toxic combinations, such as privileged access to publicly-exposed vulnerable workloads and uses automated analysis to reveal and prioritize risks.\n\n\n\nWhy is this solution important to Tenable?\n\n  * Identity based threats are a major issue. Cloud complexity – including identity sprawl and layers of policies that often change – makes understanding access risk and permissions extremely difficult.\n  * Following completion, we expect the acquisition of Ermetic will accelerate Tenable’s ability to address these complex issues and increase Tenable’s leadership position in the Cloud Security market \n    * Ermetic provides extensive CNAPP capabilities, significantly enhancing Tenable’s offering specifically in Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) where Ermetic excels and is a leading vendor.\n\n\n\nHow does this accelerate your cloud roadmap?\n\n  * We intend to combine the best technology from Ermetic and our existing Tenable Cloud Security product going forward to maximize value for our customers.\n  * Our cloud security product has strong agentless assessment and infrastructure as code, some CSPM and container registry scanning. Ermetic adds unified, elegantly integrated CNAPP, market-leading CIEM, strong CSPM and integrated workflows.\n\n\n\nWhy is Tenable uniquely positioned to win in the cloud security market?\n\n  * **Unified CNAPP** - a unified and agentless solution that automates asset discovery, risk analysis, accelerated remediation and compliance. From shift-left infrastructure as code security to agent-based and agentless assessment for runtime environments, broad CNAPP capabilities will be delivered via an elegant user experience that minimizes complexity and speeds adoption.\n  * **Powerful CIEM** - a comprehensive solution for managing human and service identities for cloud infrastructure. It visualizes all identities and entitlements, using automated analysis to reveal and prioritize risks.\n  * **Context-aware risk prioritization** - context across all cloud and on-premises resources, including workloads, identities and data. Enhanced exposure management will extend visibility across the hybrid, multi-cloud attack surface.\n  * **Simplified remediation** - guidance on and automation of the remediation process that enables organizations to make rapid improvements in their security posture.\n\n\n\nWill Ermetic be integrated into the broader Tenable One offering?\n\n  * Yes, we expect it will accelerate our cloud security roadmap both on a standalone basis and for Tenable One.\n  * The unified data model we have been building makes integrating 3rd parties easier which should make this acquisition a more seamless integration into Tenable One.\n\n\n\nIs it the same buyer? What is your go-to-market strategy?\n\n  * Yes, the same buyer that is currently purchasing our standalone cloud security offering and our unified exposure management offering, Tenable One.\n  * This acquisition provides an elegantly unified CNAPP platform with powerful CIEM functionality for our global sales organization and distribution partners. Further, this acquisition creates a compelling upsell opportunity across our 40,000+ customers.\n\n\n\nWhat is the TAM?\n\n  * This acquisition expands our total addressable market to over $30 billion and accelerates our ability to address the $45 billion+ cloud security market. We will discuss our TAM in greater detail in December at our investor day.\n\n\n\nWhat are the terms of the agreement?\n\n  * Tenable will acquire Ermetic for approximately $240 million in cash and $25 million in restricted stock and RSUs, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.\n  * The acquisition is expected to close early in the fourth quarter 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\n  * Tenable expects to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with existing cash.\n\n\n\nWhat is the impact on your 2023 outlook?\n\n  * Ermetic’s financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023 are not expected to be material to revenue and calculated current billings. Non-Gaap operating expenses are expected to increase by $4-$6 million and EPS is expected to decrease by 6 to 8 cents, assuming the issuance of 1.4 million shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units for a portion of the purchase price consideration as well as retention related awards. Consistent with prior practice, we exclude acquisition-related expenses from our non-GAAP results. Unlevered free cash flow in the fourth quarter is expected to be reduced by $14-$16 million, which includes $10-$12 million of acquisition-related expenses and forgone interest income.\n\n\n\nWhat do you expect the impact to be for 2024?\n\n  * For 2024, Ermetic is expected to contribute approximately two percentage points of growth to calculated current billings and approximately one point of revenue growth. For the full year, non-GAAP income from operations is expected to decrease by $5 to $10 million. Unlevered free cash flow in 2024 is expected to decrease by $10-$15 million. We expect the transaction to be breakeven in Q4’24 for both non-GAAP income from operations and unlevered free cash flow.\n\n\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis Q&A contains forward-looking information related to Tenable, Ermetic and the potential acquisition that involves substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words: “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “evaluate,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” or “will,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements in this Q&A are based on each of the companies’ current plans, objectives, estimates, expectations and intentions and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Ermetic’s or Tenable’s control. Forward-looking statements in this Q&A include, among other things, statements about the potential benefits of the acquisition and product developments and other possible or assumed business strategies, anticipated financial impact of the acquisition, potential growth opportunities, new products and potential market opportunities and the anticipated timing of the closing of the acquisition. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, our ability to successfully integrate Ermetic’s operations; our ability to implement our plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Ermetic’s business; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; our ability to consummate the transaction pursuant to the terms and in accordance with the timing described in this press release; disruption from the acquisition making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the inability to retain key employees; the negative effects of the consummation of the acquisition on the market price of our common stock or on our operating results; unknown liabilities; attracting new customers and maintaining and expanding our existing customer base; our ability to scale and update our platform to respond to customers’ needs and rapid technological change; increased competition on our market and our ability to compete effectively; and expansion of our operations and increased adoption of our platform internationally.\n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included in the section titled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and other filings that we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this Q&A are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, Tenable assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of these costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.\n"
