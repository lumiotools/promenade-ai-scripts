(NASDAQ: [SCYX](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IT145wT0uBRfEtIZmor6E9JhygMzTih9WoosXzMptpkEmqIUMPEOhs0Bt_3dkv9_ocIBGW2xjZ1SL2Xrt3Vv0I03NDu6rEuMU03wtySSNHgRGTQvkJXmseRi0kZrORI5 \"Opens in a new window\")), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We see substantial value in our ibrexafungerp partnered programs and have been making significant progress advancing the manufacturing of clinical trial materials, which would enable the re-start of the Phase 3 MARIO trial in invasive candidiasis, anticipated in early 2025.” said David Angulo, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, SCY-247 has demonstrated highly encouraging preclinical results in a broad range of invasive fungal infections, underscoring its potential to be a new therapeutic to fight hard-to-treat fungal pathogens. We continue to share these promising results with the scientific community, most recently at IDWeek 2024. A planned Phase 1 trial of SCY-247 remains on track to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are also pleased to have completed the FURI, CARES and NATURE studies of ibrexafungerp in refractory invasive fungal infections, which showed positive results consistent with results reported from previous interim analyses. Delivery of final study reports to our partner triggered a $10 million milestone payment received in the third quarter.”\n\n**SCY-247 Preclinical Development Program**\n\n  * Preclinical data from studies of SCY-247, the second generation fungerp from SCYNEXIS’ proprietary antifungal platform, were presented at multiple medical meetings, including the [Mycoses Study Group Education & Research Consortium (MSGERC) Biennial Meeting](https://msgerc.org/2024-biennial-meeting/ \"Opens in a new window\") in September 2024 and [IDWeek](https://idweek.org/ \"Opens in a new window\") in October 2024. These presentations highlighted encouraging preclinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic data on SCY-247 in multiple models of invasive fungal infections, including: \n    * Positive dose-dependent efficacy against _Candida albicans_ mouse model following oral administration;\n    * Significant and dose-dependent reductions in kidney and lung fungal burden in _Candida glabrata_ mouse model;\n    * Prolonged survival and reductions in lung and brain fungal burden in a pulmonary mucormycosis mouse model; and\n    * High tissue distribution into organs of concern for invasive fungal infections.\n\n\n  * Phase I initiation continues to be anticipated in Q4 2024. \n\n\n\n**Ibrexafungerp Clinical Updates**\n\n  * Final study reports from the completed FURI, CARES and NATURE studies were delivered to partner, GSK in July 2024. Delivery of these reports triggered a $10 million development milestone payment to SCYNEXIS which was received in the third quarter of 2024. Results from the FURI and CARES studies are planned to be presented by GSK at a future medical meeting. For more information on the trials, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov (CARES: [NCT03363841](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03363841?tab=history&a=13#version-content-panel \"Opens in a new window\"); FURI: [NCT03059992](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03059992?term=FURI&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")).\n\n\n  * Third-party manufacturing of new batches of ibrexafungerp for use in clinical trials is in progress, and SCYNEXIS anticipates restarting the Phase 3 MARIO study in invasive candidiasis in Q1 2025. \n\n\n\n**Guggenheim Conference Participation**\n\nScynexis management will be participating in the Guggenheim Securities Healthcare Conference, taking place in Boston from November 11-13, 2024. Please contact your Guggenheim representative to schedule a meeting with the team.\n\n**Date:** November 12, 2024**Format:** 1x1 Meetings\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue primarily consists of $0.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in license agreement revenue associated with the GSK license agreement.\n\nResearch and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.1 million compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $1.6 million, or 25%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by an increase of $2.2 million in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expense, an increase of $0.9 million in preclinical expense, and a net increase in other research and development expense of $0.4 million, offset in part by a decrease of $1.6 million in clinical expense and a decrease of $0.3 million in salaries primarily associated with medical affairs.\n\nSG&A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $2.9 million from $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $2.1 million, or 42%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.5 million in professional fees and a decrease of $0.5 million in commercial expense due to the costs incurred in the prior period associated with BREXAFEMME.\n\nTotal other income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus total other income of $8.3 million for the same period in 2023. The variance is mainly due to the fair value adjustment related to the warrant liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of $6.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, on the fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities primarily due to the changes in our stock price during the periods.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.8 million, or $0.06 basic loss per share, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.04 basic loss per share for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $84.9 million on September 30, 2024, compared to $98.0 million on December 31, 2023. Based upon the company’s current operating plan, SCYNEXIS believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments provide a cash runway into Q3 2026.\n\n**About Triterpenoid Antifungals**\n\nTriterpenoid antifungals (also known as “fungerps”) are a novel class of structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitors that combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. They have demonstrated broad-spectrum antifungal activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, including azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains. Ibrexafungerp is the first representative of this novel class of antifungal agents. Ibrexafungerp, formerly known as SCY-078, is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and is in late-stage of development for invasive candidiasis and other indications. SCY-247 is a next generation fungerp in pre-clinical development for the treatment of life-threatening and often multi-drug-resistant fungal diseases including _Candida auris_ infections.\n\n**About SCYNEXIS**\n\nSCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phase, including the compound SCY-247.

The triterpenoid class of antifungals represents the first new class of antifungal compounds approved since 2001. These agents combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. SCY-247 is in pre-IND development stage and has demonstrated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ broad-spectrum antifungal activity, including against multidrug resistant fungal pathogens. SCYNEXIS anticipates that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may grant SCY-247 Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for the IV and oral formulations of SCY-247.\n\n**About SCYNEXIS**\n\nSCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps”. Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing.

The increase of $1.6\nmillion, or 25%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by an\nincrease of $2.2 million in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expense, an\nincrease of $0.9 million in preclinical expense, and a net increase in other research and\ndevelopment expense of $0.4 million, offset in part by a decrease of $1.6 million in clinical\nexpense and a decrease of $0.3 million in salaries primarily associated with medical affairs.\nSG&A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $2.9 million\nfrom $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $2.1 million, or 42%, for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.5 million\nin professional fees and a decrease of $0.5 million in commercial expense due to the costs\nincurred in the prior period associated with BREXAFEMME.\nTotal other income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus\ntotal other income of $8.3 million for the same period in 2023. The variance is mainly due to\nthe fair value adjustment related to the warrant liabilities. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of $6.8 million and $7.5 million,\nrespectively, on the fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities primarily due to the changes\nin our stock price during the periods.\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.8 million, or $0.06 basic\nloss per share, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.04 basic loss per share for the\nsame period in 2023.\nCash Balance\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $84.9 million on September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $98.0 million on December 31, 2023. Based upon the company’s current\noperating plan, SCYNEXIS believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments\nprovide a cash runway into Q3 2026.\nAbout Triterpenoid Antifungals\nTriterpenoid antifungals (also known as “fungerps”) are a novel class of structurally distinct\nglucan synthase inhibitors that combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase\ninhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. They\nhave demonstrated broad-spectrum antifungal activity against multidrug-resistant\npathogens, including azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains. Ibrexafungerp is the first\nrepresentative of this novel class of antifungal agents. Ibrexafungerp, formerly known as\nSCY-078, is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and\nis in late-stage of development for invasive candidiasis and other indications. SCY-247 is a\nnext generation fungerp in pre-clinical development for the treatment of life-threatening and\noften multi-drug-resistant fungal diseases including Candida auris infections.\nAbout SCYNEXIS\nSCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative\nmedicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat\ninfections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the\ncompany’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative\nof this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\napproved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in\nvulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for\nreduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp\nfor the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is\nongoing.

We continue to share these promising results with the scientific community, most recently at IDWeek 2024. A planned Phase 1 trial of SCY-247 remains on track to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are also pleased to have completed the FURI, CARES and NATURE studies of ibrexafungerp in refractory invasive fungal infections, which showed positive results consistent with results reported from previous interim analyses. Delivery of final study reports to our partner triggered a $10 million milestone payment received in the third quarter.”\n\n**SCY-247 Preclinical Development Program**\n\n  * Preclinical data from studies of SCY-247, the second generation fungerp from SCYNEXIS’ proprietary antifungal platform, were presented at multiple medical meetings, including the [Mycoses Study Group Education & Research Consortium (MSGERC) Biennial Meeting](https://msgerc.org/2024-biennial-meeting/ \"Opens in a new window\") in September 2024 and [IDWeek](https://idweek.org/ \"Opens in a new window\") in October 2024. These presentations highlighted encouraging preclinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic data on SCY-247 in multiple models of invasive fungal infections, including: \n    * Positive dose-dependent efficacy against _Candida albicans_ mouse model following oral administration;\n    * Significant and dose-dependent reductions in kidney and lung fungal burden in _Candida glabrata_ mouse model;\n    * Prolonged survival and reductions in lung and brain fungal burden in a pulmonary mucormycosis mouse model; and\n    * High tissue distribution into organs of concern for invasive fungal infections.\n\n\n  * Phase I initiation continues to be anticipated in Q4 2024. \n\n\n\n**Ibrexafungerp Clinical Updates**\n\n  * Final study reports from the completed FURI, CARES and NATURE studies were delivered to partner, GSK in July 2024. Delivery of these reports triggered a $10 million development milestone payment to SCYNEXIS which was received in the third quarter of 2024. Results from the FURI and CARES studies are planned to be presented by GSK at a future medical meeting. For more information on the trials, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov (CARES: [NCT03363841](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03363841?tab=history&a=13#version-content-panel \"Opens in a new window\"); FURI: [NCT03059992](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03059992?term=FURI&rank=1 \"Opens in a new window\")).\n\n\n  * Third-party manufacturing of new batches of ibrexafungerp for use in clinical trials is in progress, and SCYNEXIS anticipates restarting the Phase 3 MARIO study in invasive candidiasis in Q1 2025. \n\n\n\n**Guggenheim Conference Participation**\n\nScynexis management will be participating in the Guggenheim Securities Healthcare Conference, taking place in Boston from November 11-13, 2024. Please contact your Guggenheim representative to schedule a meeting with the team.\n\n**Date:** November 12, 2024**Format:** 1x1 Meetings\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue primarily consists of $0.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in license agreement revenue associated with the GSK license agreement.\n\nResearch and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.1 million compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $1.6 million, or 25%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by an increase of $2.2 million in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expense, an increase of $0.9 million in preclinical expense, and a net increase in other research and development expense of $0.4 million, offset in part by a decrease of $1.6 million in clinical expense and a decrease of $0.3 million in salaries primarily associated with medical affairs.\n\nSG&A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $2.9 million from $5.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $2.1 million, or 42%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.5 million in professional fees and a decrease of $0.5 million in commercial expense due to the costs incurred in the prior period associated with BREXAFEMME.\n\nTotal other income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus total other income of $8.3 million for the same period in 2023. The variance is mainly due to the fair value adjustment related to the warrant liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of $6.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, on the fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities primarily due to the changes in our stock price during the periods.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.8 million, or $0.06 basic loss per share, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.04 basic loss per share for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $84.9 million on September 30, 2024, compared to $98.0 million on December 31, 2023. Based upon the company’s current operating plan, SCYNEXIS believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments provide a cash runway into Q3 2026.\n\n**About Triterpenoid Antifungals**\n\nTriterpenoid antifungals (also known as “fungerps”) are a novel class of structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitors that combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. They have demonstrated broad-spectrum antifungal activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, including azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains. Ibrexafungerp is the first representative of this novel class of antifungal agents. Ibrexafungerp, formerly known as SCY-078, is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and is in late-stage of development for invasive candidiasis and other indications. SCY-247 is a next generation fungerp in pre-clinical development for the treatment of life-threatening and often multi-drug-resistant fungal diseases including _Candida auris_ infections.\n\n**About SCYNEXIS**\n\nSCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phase, including the compound SCY-247.

The triterpenoid class of antifungals represents the first new class of antifungal compounds approved since 2001. These agents combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. SCY-247 is in pre-IND development stage and has demonstrated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ broad-spectrum antifungal activity, including against multidrug resistant fungal pathogens. SCYNEXIS anticipates that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may grant SCY-247 Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for the IV and oral formulations of SCY-247.\n\n**About SCYNEXIS**\n\nSCYNEXIS, Inc.

Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phase, including the compound SCY-247.
