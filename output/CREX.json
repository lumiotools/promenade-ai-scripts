(NASDAQ: CREX, CREXW), a leading provider of digital signage and media solutions, is announcing the significant momentum and transformative impact of its purpose-built digital menu board CMS platform, [Clarity](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GTUodYdbdwOCvBae8NPs1s7ewpEiQGTD7XtlwBsKMHVMskxf2p-ycaauYkhQzD6flBXZLef6-QJBDvG1zaAE47x7GHAWi7TA-d97M7q8PRGPnrtP5QTtTt2vZfCMbSJR)™. Designed to meet the unique needs of food and beverage brands, Clarity empowers fast-growing quick-service restaurants (QSR) and fast-casual chains to scale operations, streamline menu management and deliver dynamic, customer-focused experiences.\n\nClarity has quickly become the platform of choice for [tens of thousands of food and beverage brick and mortar locations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cnqmhDRvDfq9n57l1gmn_gcMqMch_J3cQUZARcOMPcQ0HU87J9Szme5mcORPZBKam0ys6y0Q02aOnkBOAwlmY4h3yGgk7k7Cjuxb_Q5-oqfpxgKGfGpHi0FrWSM4XOz8Dd43-bjccwhpmS2Od3gztf646fbopLS1chwX_08QMBrcigoHbwW1IJAnP8OE2Iv5), enabling brands to simplify complex menu board configurations while integrating seamlessly with existing POS systems. With Clarity, users can dynamically update pricing, introduce marketing messages and promote products in real time—all while ensuring accuracy and operational efficiency across their networks.\n\nEmerging brands such as [7 Brew](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CCgpXcgEd07DWFinAgaBGfmTcRXIqZirED-79aC5Zo9sAbCfbDrhwa7Nu3oTz3oH), a drive-thru-only coffee concept, and [Steele Brands](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FEAqsxI4xY4rZOYTGX9UMV5JEZ-xnciVqCc4xGyziXTJQn8_jfCs07-QZgBy7WB0JBdLCcncvqbjKTiutTjJFjglX2gmG3f3OktM8QvFOxU=), the parent company of fast-casual restaurants like [Crisp & Green](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XlEXq9TLXsHaAdpQ0hU-jSVTQ8zw3oT4KxwhuQvVB5JeGA9yUYDkzICDgxqcKH7s6fGv87RSJlp8lpnMcNtZWalFjxLzEUcTmRI4TUXu1ZA=) and [PURALIMA](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1dm9hnjRtm1yc4L0lPYQyqhpEDZKyHgl_Y-QFScowhe9VZaiAAeA3moF8Idjp7kr39RIFlIxyqeMchpK-ok5Mw==), have adopted Clarity to optimize their digital menu operations and support rapid franchise growth. With hundreds of locations onstream and growing, 7 Brew utilizes Clarity to streamline pricing adjustments across regional zones and Limited-Time Offers (LTOs), while ensuring consistent, high-quality menu experiences for its fast-paced operations. Similarly, Steele Brands turned to Clarity for its growing network of franchisees, leveraging the platform’s intuitive interface to automate content updates, design detailed menu hierarchies and maintain brand consistency. For both companies, Clarity has simplified scaling operations while empowering their teams to remain agile and creative.\n\n“We understand that scalability and operational efficiency are critical for food and beverage brands navigating rapid growth,” said Rick Mills, CEO of Creative Realities. “Clarity is implemented with these challenges in mind, enabling brands to seamlessly adapt their guest experience and operational strategies—whether in drive-thru environments or fast-casual settings—while delivering the kind of elevated customer experiences that drive loyalty and growth.”\n\nClarity is proving especially critical as QSR brands gear up for the holiday season—a key period for LTOs and promotional campaigns. By enabling brands to seamlessly feature seasonal beverages, bundled deals and retail products on their digital displays, Clarity drives customer engagement and revenue. For instance, 7 Brew has leveraged Clarity to highlight its rotating LTO menu, including specialty coffee flavors, while simultaneously promoting merchandise like branded roast bags for customers to enjoy at home.\n\n“This holiday season, brands have the opportunity to act with unmatched agility, ensuring their seasonal promotions resonate powerfully with customers,” Mills added. “The seamless connection between menu offerings and retail products, paired with the ability to adapt in real-time, creates an elevated customer experience that not only enhances engagement but also drives meaningful sales.”\n\nAs a key component of the menu tech stack, Clarity provides brands with the tools to achieve enterprise-level performance from day one. Its scalable architecture supports rapid expansion across franchise networks, allowing brands to manage multi-zone pricing strategies, automate updates and optimize content for maximum impact. From streamlining menu management through POS integration to driving data-informed decisions, Clarity delivers measurable ROI for food and beverage brands of all sizes.\n\nFor more information about Clarity™ and Creative Realities, visit [www.cri.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NU_-kOZkwgMXoU5mjL0WQyA3eAskHhqBkCP1t7C3U7bufnWq_SwzwxjVQJ_hY_eP67cbsbEHMD44pmyUhOXzGA==).\n\n**About Creative Realities, Inc.** Creative Realities helps clients use the latest omnichannel technologies to inspire better customer experiences.

(“Creative Realities,” “CRI,” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CREX), a leading provider of digital signage and media solutions, today announced its financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * Record third quarter revenue of $14.4 million, up 25% from $11.6 million in the prior-year period\n  * Gross profit of $6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus $5.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 25%\n  * Net Income improved by $1.9 million during third quarter, to breakeven, as compared to third quarter prior year\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus $1.0 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 122%\n  * Annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) of approximately $18.1 million at the end of the third quarter versus $18.0 million as of June 30, 2024\n\n\n\n“Our financial results – including third quarter record revenue and profitable bottom-line performance – put us squarely on track for the Company’s best year in its history,” said Rick Mills, Chief Executive Officer. “Revenue rose 25% year-over-year, and Adjusted EBITDA climbed to $2.3 million, as we moved closer to achieving many of our goals for fiscal 2024. Our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue rose to 15.8% in the quarter and to 11.5% year-to-date, bringing our trailing twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA to $7.4 million, or 13.6% of trailing twelve-month revenue. This Adjusted EBITDA is ahead of our prior projection of a 2024 exit run-rate of approximately 12% on revenue of $60 million. While the Company’s active business development pipeline positions us positively for 2025 and beyond, we project a shortfall in revenue against our prior projections for the 2024 fourth quarter and the fiscal year as material opportunities have taken longer to finalize, contract, and deploy, thus pushing these projected revenues into 2025. We are confident that 2024 will represent record revenue and profitability under any scenario and remain excited about the future and committed to accelerating growth, expanding margins, optimizing our capital structure and, as always, increasing returns for our shareholders.”\n\n*Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is provided in the tables of this press release.\n\n**_2024 Third Quarter Financial Results_**\n\nSales were $14.4 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, an increase of $2.9 million, or 25%, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Hardware revenue was $5.2 million, versus $4.8 million in the prior-year period, while service revenue rose to $9.2 million from $6.7 million in fiscal 2023. Service growth was significant year-over-year reflecting strong demand and a higher installed base of business.\n\nConsolidated gross profit was $6.6 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter versus $5.3 million in the prior-year period, and consolidated gross margin was 45.6% versus 45.8% in the fiscal 2023 third quarter. Gross margin on hardware revenue was 24.1% in fiscal 2024 as compared to 30.2% in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting product mix. Gross margin on service amounted to 57.9%, versus 57.1% in the fiscal 2023 third quarter. The Company anticipates margin expansion as revenue expands more quickly than the associated cost of deployment and support of those enhanced levels of revenue. Software subscription run-rates continued to rise, and the Company ended the quarter with record ARR of approximately $18.1 million on an annualized run rate.\n\nSales and marketing expenses in the third quarter rose to $1.5 million, versus $1.3 million in the prior-year period, reflecting enhanced investment in business development activities. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $3.9 million versus $3.8 in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Company posted operating income of approximately $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $0.2 million in fiscal 2023. CRI reported net income of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 versus a net loss of $1.9 million, or $(0.22) per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (defined later in this release) was $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $1.0 million in the prior-year period.\n\n**_Balance Sheet_** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $0.9 million, versus $2.9 million at December 31, 2023. The Company had outstanding debt of approximately $11.0 million as of September 30, 2024 versus $15.1 million at the start of the fiscal year. As of the end of the third quarter, the trailing twelve-month gross and net leverage ratios utilizing Adjusted EBTIDA were 1.49x and 1.37x, respectively, versus 2.97x and 2.40x at the beginning of 2024. Net debt is equal to the Company’s outstanding debt less cash on hand.\n\n**Conference Call Details** The Company will host a conference call to review the results of the third quarter 2024, and provide additional commentary about recent performance, today, November 13, at 9:00 am Eastern Time, which will include prepared remarks and materials from management, followed by a live Q&A. The call will be hosted by Rick Mills, Chief Executive Officer, and Will Logan, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nPrior to the call, participants should register at [https://bit.ly/CRIearnings2024Q3](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H331QhO5eZPjPamLrK2Uar8Ia5LQnSa4HupT71vNA4MLpdf2yViXfcsh9ww_wDTHzXOA1aF7aGs16R599aCMaVax7DEWUKXAu_pT1R7ZUyS8Lgx_1Q45_zpe-bJpZZj4).

An archived edition of the earnings conference call will also be posted on the Company’s website later today and will remain available for one year.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measures** Creative Realities, Inc. prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA.” CRI defines “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. CRI defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments and both cash and non-cash non-recurring gains and charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used internally in planning and evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors, bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the Company’s operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s financial results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or to net cash used in operating activities as measures of operating results or liquidity. Our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and the measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company’s performance. A reconciliation of GAAP net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial schedules.

In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA.” CRI defines “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. CRI defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments and both cash and non-cash non-recurring gains and charges.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of CRI’s profitability or liquidity. CRI’s management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful financial metrics because they allow external users of CRI’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to more effectively evaluate CRI’s operating performance, compare the results of its operations from period to period and against CRI’s peers without regard to CRI’s financing methods, hedging positions or capital structure and because it highlights trends in CRI’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. CRI also presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of its performance that are frequently used by others in evaluating companies in its industry. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA CRI presents may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net loss, CRI’s most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Quarters Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30**| **June 30**| **March 31**| **December 31**| **September 30**  \n**Quarters ended**| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \nGAAP net (loss) income| $| 54| $| (615| )| $| (109| )| $| 1,419| $| (1,931| )  \nInterest expense:  \nAmortization of debt discount| -| 209| 360| 366| 363  \nOther interest, net| 303| 304| 303| 302| 371  \nDepreciation/amortization:  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 1,081| 878| 790| 781| 766  \nAmortization of employee share-based awards| 3| 3| 3| 4| 3  \nDepreciation of property & equipment| 51| 52| 49| 48| 50  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| 192| 25| 9| 10| (15| )  \nEBITDA| $| 1,684| $| 856| $| 1,405| $| 2,930| $| (393| )  \nAdjustments  \nLoss (Gain) on fair value of contingent consideration| 598| (408| )| (604| )| (42| )| 1,369  \nLoss on debt extinguishment| -| 1,059| -| -| -  \nStock-based compensation – Director grants| -| -| -| 21| 43  \nOther (income) expense| (11| )| 18| (35| )| (79| )| 3  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 2,271| $| 1,525| $| 766| $| 2,830| 1,022  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OGVlZGMxZmYtZTk4Mi00YjhmLWJiN2EtZmE2MWFhYzc5YTRhLTEyNDQzNDM=/tiny/Creative-Realities.png)\n\n[ Print Page]()\n\n[ Email Alerts](/ir-resources/investor-email-alerts)\n\n[ RSS Feeds](/rss-feeds)\n\n[ IR Contacts](/ir-resources/investor-contacts)\n"
