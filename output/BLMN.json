(Nasdaq: BLMN) today reported results for the third quarter 2024 (“Q3 2024”) compared to the third quarter 2023 (“Q3 2023”).\n\n**CEO Comments** “In my first 60 days, I have been impressed with the resiliency and capabilities of our team during two hurricanes, as well as the potential that I see in our iconic brands,” said Mike Spanos, CEO. “As I continue listening and learning during this evaluative period, it is clear to me that our path to sustainable sales and profit growth will be enabled by our team members executing a consistent and elevated guest experience, focusing first on Outback Steakhouse. Our full year guidance has been updated to reflect our results and near term trends. We are committed to improving our performance.”\n\nSpanos continued, “I am excited to announce our Brazil franchise partnership with Vinci Partners. I am confident that our scale and brand leadership in Brazil, combined with Vinci’s local expertise, will maximize future growth potential.”\n\n**Diluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS** The following table reconciles Diluted earnings per share to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated (unaudited):\n\n**Q3**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **CHANGE**  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.08| $| 0.45| $| (0.37| )  \nAdjustments (1)| 0.13| (0.04| )| 0.17  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (1)| $| 0.21| $| 0.41| $| (0.20| )  \n_______________ (1) Adjusted diluted earnings per share for Q3 2023 has been recast to remove the previously included non-GAAP adjustment of 5.4 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding related to the convertible note hedge contracts entered into at the issuance of the 2025 Notes. See non-GAAP Measures later in this release. Also see Tables Four, Six and Seven for details regarding the nature of diluted earnings per share adjustments for the periods presented.  \n  \n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n**(dollars in millions, unaudited)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **CHANGE**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal revenues| $| 1,038.8| $| 1,079.8| (3.8| )%  \nGAAP operating income margin| 1.7| %| 5.4| %| (3.7| )%  \nAdjusted operating income margin (1)| 3.0| %| 5.3| %| (2.3| )%  \nRestaurant-level operating margin (1)| 12.5| %| 13.8| %| (1.3| )%  \nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin (1)| 12.5| %| 14.0| %| (1.5| )%  \n_______________ (1) See non-GAAP Measures later in this release. Also see Tables Four and Six for details regarding the nature of restaurant-level operating margin and operating income margin adjustments, respectively.  \n  \n  * The decrease in Total revenues was primarily due to: (i) lower comparable restaurant sales, (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation of the Brazilian Real relative to the U.S. dollar and (iii) the net impact of restaurant closures and openings.\n  * GAAP operating income margin decreased from Q3 2023 primarily due to: (i) a decrease in restaurant-level operating margin, as detailed below, (ii) lapping of a lease termination gain in Q3 2023 and closure costs in Q3 2024 from the closure of nine restaurants in Hong Kong, (iii) higher general and administrative expense primarily from executive transition costs and strategic initiative related professional fees and (iv) higher depreciation and amortization expense.\n  * Restaurant-level operating margin decreased from Q3 2023 primarily due to lower restaurant sales, as discussed above and higher labor, operating and commodity costs, primarily due to inflation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in average check per person and the impact of certain cost-saving and productivity initiatives.\n  * Adjusted income from operations primarily excludes: (i) the Q3 2023 lease termination gain and Q3 2024 closure costs in Hong Kong and (ii) executive transition costs and strategic initiative related professional fees.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Comparable Restaurant Sales**\n\n**THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2024**| **COMPANY-OWNED**  \n---|---  \nComparable restaurant sales (stores open 18 months or more):  \n**U.S.****(1)**  \nOutback Steakhouse| (1.3| )%  \nCarrabba’s Italian Grill| (1.5| )%  \nBonefish Grill| (4.1| )%  \nFleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar| 1.2| %  \nCombined U.S.| (1.5| )%  \n**International**  \nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil (2)| (3.6| )%  \n_______________ (1) For Q3 2024, comparable restaurant sales compare the thirteen weeks from July 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the thirteen weeks from July 3, 2023 through October 1, 2023. See Table Ten for details regarding our fiscal and comparable basis calendars. (2) Excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the benefit of Brazil value added tax exemptions. Includes trading day impact from calendar period reporting.  \n  \n**Dividend Declaration and Share Repurchases** On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on December 11, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2024.\n\nYear to date we repurchased 10.1 million shares for a total of $265.7 million during 2024 and have $96.8 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Financial Outlook** The table below presents our updated expectations for selected 2024 financial operating results. We are reaffirming all other aspects of our full-year financial guidance as previously communicated.\n\n**Financial Results:**| **Prior Outlook**| **Current Outlook**  \n---|---|---  \nU.S. comparable restaurant sales| Down 1% to Flat| (1.0%) to (0.5%)  \nCommodity inflation| 2% to 3%| Approx. 1%  \nGAAP effective tax rate (1)| 26% to 28%| NM  \nAdjusted effective tax rate| 8% to 10%| 6% to 7%  \nGAAP diluted earnings per share (1)(2)| $0.25 to $0.45| ($0.26) to ($0.16)  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (3)| $2.10 to $2.30| $1.72 to $1.82  \n_______________ NM Not meaningful. (1) Guidance does not include estimates of impairments, gain or loss on sale or transaction-related costs of the Brazil transaction. (2) For GAAP purposes assumes diluted weighted average shares of approximately 86 million. (3) Assumes diluted weighted average shares of approximately 89 million, considering the expected adjusted net income position.  \n  \n**Q4 2024 Financial Outlook** The table below presents our expectations for selected fiscal Q4 2024 financial operating results.\n\n**Financial Results:**| **Q4 2024 Outlook**  \n---|---  \nU.S. comparable restaurant sales| (2.0%) to (1.0%)  \nGAAP diluted earnings per share (1)(2)| $0.31 to $0.41  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (2)| $0.32 to $0.42  \n_______________ (1) Guidance does not include estimates of impairments, gain or loss on sale or transaction-related costs of the Brazil transaction. (2) Assumes diluted weighted average shares of approximately 86 million.  \n  \n**Strategic Re-Franchise of Brazil Operations** On November 6, 2024, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Vinci Partners to sell 67% of our Brazil operations for R$1.4 billion Brazilian Reais (approximately $243 million in U.S. dollars based on the current exchange rate). This reflects a total enterprise value of R$2.06 billion Brazilian Reais or 6.5x trailing twelve months EBITDA, net of royalties. This strategic re-franchise includes an on-going royalty stream. The purchase price will be paid in two installments: 52% on the closing date and 48% on the first anniversary of the closing date. We have an option to sell our remaining stake in 2028.\n\nBofA Securities, Inc. acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Company.\n\n**Conference Call** The Company will host a conference call today, November 8, 2024 at 8:30 AM EST. The conference call will be webcast live from the Company’s website at [http://www.bloominbrands.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloominbrands.com&esheet=54148570&newsitemid=20241108578674&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloominbrands.com&index=1&md5=fe07c7e6505fc50a12a71e6d84e94125) under the Investors section.

The Company’s restaurant portfolio includes Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar.

These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP and include: (i) Restaurant-level operating income, adjusted restaurant-level operating income and their corresponding margins, (ii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margin, (iii) Adjusted segment income from operations and the corresponding margin, (iv) Adjusted net income and (v) Adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n\nRestaurant-level operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure widely regarded in the industry as a useful metric to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations, and we use it for these purposes, overall and particularly within our two segments.\n\nWe believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. You should refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures in Tables Four, Five, Six and Seven included later in this release for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** Certain statements contained herein, including statements under the headings “CEO Comments”, “Fiscal 2024 Financial Outlook” and “Q4 2024 Financial Outlook” are not based on historical fact and are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are typically used to service debt obligations and to make capital expenditures.  \n**TABLE FOUR**  \n---  \n**BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.**  \n**RESTAURANT-LEVEL AND ADJUSTED RESTAURANT-LEVEL OPERATING INCOME AND MARGINS NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS**  \n**(UNAUDITED)**  \n_**Consolidated**_| **THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nIncome from operations| $| 17,210| $| 58,216| $| 140,434| $| 268,295  \n _Operating income margin_|  1.7| %| 5.4| %| 4.2| %| 7.7| %  \nLess:  \nFranchise and other revenues| 13,681| 15,420| 44,822| 47,296  \nPlus:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 50,208| 47,998| 149,015| 141,865  \nGeneral and administrative| 68,485| 62,246| 196,413| 191,408  \nProvision for impaired assets and restaurant closings| 5,597| (6,008| )| 32,731| (857| )  \nRestaurant-level operating income (1)| $| 127,819| $| 147,032| $| 473,771| $| 553,415  \n _Restaurant-level operating margin_|  12.5| %| 13.8| %| 14.3| %| 16.1| %  \nAdjustments:  \nAsset impairments and closure-related charges| —| —| 434| —  \nPartner compensation (2)| —| 1,894| —| 1,894  \nTotal restaurant-level operating income adjustments| —| 1,894| 434| 1,894  \nAdjusted restaurant-level operating income| $| 127,819| $| 148,926| $| 474,205| $| 555,309  \n _Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin_|  12.5| %| 14.0| %| 14.3| %| 16.2| %  \n_______________(1) The following categories of revenue and operating expenses are not included in restaurant-level operating income and the corresponding margin because we do not consider them reflective of operating performance at the restaurant-level within a period:  \n(a) Franchise and other revenues, which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams, such as rental and sublease income. (b) Depreciation and amortization, which, although substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, represent historical sunk costs rather than cash outlays for the restaurants.

(d) Asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs, which are not reflective of ongoing restaurant performance in a period.  \n(2) Costs incurred in connection with the transition to a new partner compensation program.  \n_**U.S.**_| **THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n---|---|---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nIncome from operations| $| 38,853| $| 68,014| $| 216,014| $| 304,265  \n _Operating income margin_|  4.4| %| 7.4| %| 7.4| %| 10.1| %  \nLess:  \nFranchise and other revenues| 10,273| 11,834| 34,566| 36,052  \nPlus:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 41,922| 39,829| 122,506| 117,368  \nGeneral and administrative| 27,945| 24,868| 79,853| 72,809  \nProvision for impaired assets and restaurant closings| 1,868| (6,008| )| 14,939| (857| )  \nRestaurant-level operating income| $| 100,315| $| 114,869| $| 398,746| $| 457,533  \n _Restaurant-level operating margin_|  11.4| %| 12.7| %| 13.9| %| 15.4| %  \nAdjustments:  \nAsset impairments and closure-related charges| —| —| 434| —  \nPartner compensation (1)| —| 1,894| —| 1,894  \nTotal restaurant-level operating income adjustments| —| 1,894| 434| 1,894  \nAdjusted restaurant-level operating income| $| 100,315| $| 116,763| $| 399,180| $| 459,427  \n _Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin_|  11.4| %| 13.0| %| 13.9| %| 15.4| %  \n_______________ (1) Costs incurred in connection with the transition to a new partner compensation program.  \n_**International**_| **THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n---|---|---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nIncome from operations| $| 15,608| $| 22,034| $| 30,496| $| 67,028  \n _Operating income margin_|  10.3| %| 13.2| %| 6.8| %| 14.4| %  \nLess:  \nFranchise and other revenues| 3,408| 3,586| 10,256| 11,244  \nPlus:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,184| 6,231| 20,140| 18,275  \nGeneral and administrative| 9,098| 7,725| 22,240| 22,033  \nProvision for impaired assets and restaurant closings| 3,728| —| 17,791| —  \nRestaurant-level operating income| $| 31,210| $| 32,404| $| 80,411| $| 96,092  \n _Restaurant-level operating margin_|  21.1| %| 19.8| %| 18.4| %| 21.1| %  \n**TABLE FIVE**  \n---  \n**BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.**  \n**CONSOLIDATED RESTAURANT-LEVEL OPERATING MARGIN NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS**  \n**(UNAUDITED)**  \n**THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **FAVORABLE****(UNFAVORABLE)****ADJUSTED CHANGE****QUARTER TO DATE**  \n**SEPTEMBER 29, 2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24, 2023**  \n**REPORTED**| **ADJUSTED**| **REPORTED**| **ADJUSTED (1)**  \nRestaurant sales| 100.0| %| 100.0| %| 100.0| %| 100.0| %  \nFood and beverage| 29.7| %| 29.7| %| 30.2| %| 30.2| %| 0.5| %  \nLabor and other related| 30.5| %| 30.5| %| 29.5| %| 29.4| %| (1.1| )%  \nOther restaurant operating| 27.3| %| 27.3| %| 26.4| %| 26.4| %| (0.9| )%  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| 12.5| %| 12.5| %| 13.8| %| 14.0| %| (1.5| )%  \n**THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**| **FAVORABLE****(UNFAVORABLE)****ADJUSTED CHANGE****YEAR TO DATE**  \n**SEPTEMBER 29, 2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24, 2023**  \n**REPORTED**| **ADJUSTED (1)**| **REPORTED**| **ADJUSTED (1)**  \nRestaurant sales| 100.0| %| 100.0| %| 100.0| %| 100.0| %  \nFood and beverage| 30.2| %| 30.2| %| 30.8| %| 30.8| %| 0.6| %  \nLabor and other related| 29.8| %| 29.8| %| 28.6| %| 28.6| %| (1.2| )%  \nOther restaurant operating| 25.7| %| 25.7| %| 24.4| %| 24.4| %| (1.3| )%  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| 14.3| %| 14.3| %| 16.1| %| 16.2| %| (1.9| )%  \n_______________ (1) See Table Four _Restaurant-level and Adjusted Restaurant-Level Operating Income and Margins Non-GAAP Reconciliations_ for details regarding restaurant-level operating margin adjustments.

(2) The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 include asset impairment, closure costs and severance primarily in connection with the Q2 2024 decision to close nine restaurants in Hong Kong, within the international segment. The thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 also includes asset impairment, closure costs and severance in connection with the Q4 2023 decision to close 36 older, predominately underperforming U.S. restaurants. The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 include a lease termination gain and related restaurant closure costs within the U.S. segment. (3) Compensation costs and professional fees related to our CEO transition and severance related to other executive level changes. (4) Represents fees incurred in connection with a project-based strategic initiative. The costs incurred represent third-party consulting fees related to a strategic initiative to develop revenue growth management capabilities for Outback Steakhouse and are included in General and administrative expense. We expect to incur additional fees for this project for the remainder of 2024. Given the magnitude and scope of this initiative and that it is not expected to recur in the foreseeable future after 2024, we consider these incremental expenses to be distinct from other consulting fees that we incur in the ordinary course of business and not reflective of the ongoing costs to operate our business or operating performance in the period. (5) Costs incurred in connection with the strategic review and agreement to sell the majority ownership of our Brazil operations and pending franchise partnership transaction. (6) Primarily includes professional fees, severance and other costs not correlated to our core operating performance during the period.  \n**TABLE SEVEN**  \n---  \n**BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.**  \n**ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS**  \n**(UNAUDITED)**  \n**THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n**(in thousands, except per share data)**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nNet income (loss) attributable to Bloomin’ Brands| $| 6,912| $| 44,528| $| (48,557| )| $| 204,116  \nAdjustments:  \nIncome from operations adjustments (1)| 13,738| (1,256| )| 43,918| (1,256| )  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt (2)| —| —| 135,797| —  \nTotal adjustments, before income taxes| 13,738| (1,256| )| 179,715| (1,256| )  \nAdjustment to provision for income taxes (3)| (2,498| )| (2,650| )| (4,466| )| (2,650| )  \nNet adjustments| 11,240| (3,906| )| 175,249| (3,906| )  \nAdjusted net income| $| 18,152| $| 40,622| $| 126,692| $| 200,210  \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share| $| 0.08| $| 0.45| $| (0.56| )| $| 2.08  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (4)(5)| $| 0.21| $| 0.41| $| 1.41| $| 2.04  \nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding (5)| 86,164| 98,548| 86,258| 97,987  \nAdjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (4)(5)| 86,164| 98,548| 90,057| 97,987  \n_______________ (1) See Table Six _Adjusted Income from Operations and Margin Non-GAAP Reconciliations_ above for details regarding Income from operations adjustments. (2) Includes losses in connection with the partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes. (3) Includes the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined based on the nature of the underlying non-GAAP adjustments and their relevant jurisdictional tax rates for all periods presented. The difference between GAAP and adjusted effective income tax rates during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 primarily relates to nondeductible losses and other tax costs associated with the partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes. The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 include a $2.9 million adjustment related to a Brazil federal income tax exemption on certain state VAT benefits. (4) Adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 and the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were calculated including the effect of 0.7 million, 5.4 million, 2.0 million and 5.1 million dilutive securities, respectively, for outstanding 2025 Notes and the effect of 0.3 million, 3.8 million, 1.4 million and 3.4 million dilutive securities, respectively, for the Warrant Transactions, as defined below. In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedge Transactions”) and concurrently entered into warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock (the “Warrant Transactions”). If our stock price is in excess of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes ($10.79 and $11.26 as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively), the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions deliver shares to offset dilution from the 2025 Notes, which, in combination with the Warrant Transactions, effectively offset dilution from the 2025 Notes up to the strike price of the Warrant Transactions ($15.11 and $15.77 as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively). Adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 have been recast to remove the 5.4 million and 5.1 million share benefit, respectively, of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions which was previously included as a non-GAAP share adjustment. (5) Due to a GAAP net loss, antidilutive securities are excluded from diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. However, considering the adjusted net income position, adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding incorporates securities that would have been dilutive for GAAP.  \n  \nFollowing is a summary of the financial statement line item classification of the net income (loss) adjustments:\n\n**THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n---|---  \n**(dollars in thousands)**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nLabor and other related| $| —| $| 1,894| $| 434| $| 1,894  \nGeneral and administrative| 10,006| 3,534| 13,980| 3,534  \nProvision for impaired assets and restaurant closings| 3,732| (6,684| )| 29,504| (6,684| )  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt| —| —| 135,797| —  \nProvision for income taxes| (2,498| )| (2,650| )| (4,466| )| (2,650| )  \nNet adjustments| $| 11,240| $| (3,906| )| $| 175,249| $| (3,906| )  \n**TABLE EIGHT**  \n---  \n**BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.**  \n**COMPARATIVE RESTAURANT INFORMATION**  \n**(UNAUDITED)**  \n**Number of restaurants:**| **JUNE 30, 2024**| **OPENINGS**| **CLOSURES**| **SEPTEMBER 29, 2024**  \nU.S.  \nOutback Steakhouse  \nCompany-owned| 549| 2| (1| )| 550  \nFranchised| 125| —| (2| )| 123  \nTotal| 674| 2| (3| )| 673  \nCarrabba’s Italian Grill  \nCompany-owned| 192| —| —| 192  \nFranchised| 18| —| —| 18  \nTotal| 210| —| —| 210  \nBonefish Grill  \nCompany-owned| 162| —| —| 162  \nFranchised| 4| —| —| 4  \nTotal| 166| —| —| 166  \nFleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar  \nCompany-owned| 63| —| —| 63  \nAussie Grill  \nCompany-owned| 4| —| —| 4  \nFranchised| 2| —| —| 2  \nTotal| 6| —| —| 6  \nU.S. total| 1,119| 2| (3| )| 1,118  \nInternational  \nCompany-owned  \nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil (1)| 165| 7| —| 172  \nOther (1)| 38| 1| (9| )| 30  \nFranchised  \nOutback Steakhouse - South Korea| 93| 1| —| 94  \nOther| 50| —| (1| )| 49  \nInternational total| 346| 9| (10| )| 345  \nSystem-wide total| 1,465| 11| (13| )| 1,463  \nSystem-wide total - Company-owned| 1,173| 10| (10| )| 1,173  \nSystem-wide total - Franchised| 292| 1| (3| )| 290  \n_______________ (1) The restaurant counts for Brazil, including Abbraccio and Aussie Grill restaurants within International Company-owned Other, are reported as of May 31, 2024 and August 31, 2024, respectively, to correspond with the balance sheet dates of this subsidiary.  \n**TABLE NINE**  \n---  \n**BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.**  \n**COMPARABLE RESTAURANT SALES INFORMATION**  \n**(UNAUDITED)**  \n**THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED**| **THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED**  \n**SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024 (1)**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**| **SEPTEMBER 29 , ****2024 (1)**| **SEPTEMBER 24 , ****2023**  \nYear over year percentage change:  \nComparable restaurant sales (restaurants open 18 months or more):  \nU.S. (2)  \nOutback Steakhouse| (1.3| )%| (1.1| )%| (0.9| )%| 1.6| %  \nCarrabba’s Italian Grill| (1.5| )%| 3.0| %| 0.4| %| 4.4| %  \nBonefish Grill| (4.1| )%| (0.5| )%| (3.7| )%| 2.2| %  \nFleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar| 1.2| %| (4.1| )%| (0.8| )%| (0.9| )%  \nCombined U.S.| (1.5| )%| (0.5| )%| (1.1| )%| 1.9| %  \nInternational  \nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil (3)(4)| (3.6| )%| 4.1| %| (1.9| )%| 7.3| %  \nTraffic:  \nU.S.  \nOutback Steakhouse| (3.9| )%| (6.1| )%| (4.0| )%| (4.3| )%  \nCarrabba’s Italian Grill| (3.4| )%| (0.1| )%| (2.7| )%| 0.3| %  \nBonefish Grill| (8.5| )%| (5.7| )%| (6.7| )%| (3.1| )%  \nFleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar| (7.3| )%| (4.4| )%| (6.7| )%| (2.1| )%  \nCombined U.S.| (4.4| )%| (4.7| )%| (4.2| )%| (3.1| )%  \nInternational  \nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil (3)| (7.7| )%| (1.0| )%| (4.9| )%| (1.0| )%  \nAverage check per person (5):  \nU.S.  \nOutback Steakhouse| 2.6| %| 5.0| %| 3.1| %| 5.9| %  \nCarrabba’s Italian Grill| 1.9| %| 3.1| %| 3.1| %| 4.1| %  \nBonefish Grill| 4.4| %| 5.2| %| 3.0| %| 5.3| %  \nFleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar| 8.5| %| 0.3| %| 5.9| %| 1.2| %  \nCombined U.S.| 2.9| %| 4.2| %| 3.1| %| 5.0| %  \nInternational  \nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil (3)| 3.4| %| 5.1| %| 2.4| %| 8.3| %  \n_______________ (1) For Q3 2024, U.S. comparable restaurant sales, traffic and average check per person compare the thirteen weeks from July 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the thirteen weeks from July 3, 2023 through October 1, 2023, and for the thirty-nine weeks from January 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the thirty-nine weeks from January 2, 2023 through October 1, 2023.
