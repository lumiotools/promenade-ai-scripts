Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 15, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/17791/pdf)\n\n_-Sequential Revenue increase points to recovery from prior year impacts-_\n\n_-Sequential and Year-over-Year OpEx Reductions Reflect Continued Benefits of Cost Optimization Initiatives-_\n\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2024-- ClearOne (NASDAQ: CLRO), a global provider of audio and visual communication solutions, reported financial results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. \n\nRevenue decreased 42% year over year, primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from the audio conferencing category, which includes our DSP mixer products. “We believe this revenue decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of past production shortages,” said Derek Graham, CEO of ClearOne. “Historically, we have seen a lag of several months between the time that our professional conferencing products are specified for a project and the date when those products are purchased for installation. Since our product availability was constrained through a significant part of Q4 2023, as a result of delays in the transition of outsourced manufacturing from China to Singapore throughout 2023, we believe our revenue was impacted negatively by these market dynamics through much of Q3 2024. Our sales in Q3 2024 were also impacted by our transition to a new distributor in the Middle East. We anticipate, although there can be no assurance that our new Middle East Distributor will continue our previous history of sales growth in the region, but there was an impact to our Net Revenue in Q3 due to the transition. We have also faced sales headwinds from our products’ lack of Microsoft Teams certification, despite their longtime functional compatibility with this platform. Our work through early 2024 has focused on mitigating these impacts through maintaining consistent dialogues, product demonstrations, and feedback cycles with end users and channel partners, along with improving our visibility at key industry events. In addition, we have increased our investments in marketing to increase the visibility of our products to end users looking for ways to improve the quality of audio and video for their meetings. Revenue increased 8.7% sequentially from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 as the company is beginning to see recovery from prior year impacts.” \n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n  * The Company generated a sequential revenue increase of 8.7% from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024. \n  * The Company reduced operating expenses by 10.1% sequentially and 9.33% year-over-year. \n  * The ClearOne BMA 360 beamforming microphone array was announced as the winner of the Utah Innovation Awards in the Consumer Product Category by Utah Business. Utah Business noted the BMA 360's unique combination of hardware microphone layout, microphone sensor capability and optimization algorithm. \n  * The DIALOG® UVHF wireless Microphone system was named a winner of the 2024 Communications Solutions products of the year award. \n  * We recorded a 31% increase in unique visitors at our 2024 Infocomm India trade show booth, while the overall annual increase of all attendees at that trade show was only 17%. \n\n\n\nGraham continued, “Throughout 2024, our team has been diligently working to win back customers who have defected to competing brands. We believe the sequential increase in revenue we saw in Q3 indicates that this work is beginning to bear fruit.” \n\n**Financial Summary**\n\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles those to GAAP measures in the attached tables. \n\n  * Q3 2024 revenue was $2.5 million, compared to $4.9 million in Q3 2023 and $2.3 million in Q2 2024. We believe the revenue decrease year over year was mainly due to sustained inventory sourcing and order fulfillment challenges for the Company's core audio conferencing and beam forming microphone arrays as a result of delays in the transition of outsourced manufacturing from China to Singapore throughout 2023. The 8.7% sequential increase was driven by increased demand across all product categories. We believe the flow of sales orders during Q3 2024 increased due to the start of recovery from the cumulative impact of past product shortages. \n  * GAAP gross profit/loss in Q3 2024 was $0.6 million, compared to $1.6 million in Q3 2023 and $(0.02) million in Q2 2024. GAAP gross profit margin was 24% in Q3 2024, compared to (1)% in Q2 2024 and 33% in Q3 2023. The large decrease in gross profit margin year over year occurred due to increased inventory scrap costs, and an increase in purchase price variance from increasing vendor costs. \n  * Operating expenses in Q3 2024 improved to $2.8 million, compared to $3.1 million in Q3 2023 and $2.9 million in Q2 2024. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 2024 improved to $2.7 million compared to $2.8 million in Q2 2024 and $2.9 million in Q3 2023. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses was mainly due to the continued benefits of the cost-cutting measures initiated in 2022. \n  * GAAP net loss in Q3 2024 was $(2.1) million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to a net loss of $(1.4) million, or $(0.06) per share, in Q3 2023 and a net loss of $(2.8) million, or $(0.12) per share, in Q2 2024. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses. \n  * Non-GAAP net loss in Q3 2024 was $(2.0) million, or $(0.08) per share, compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of $(1.2) million, or $(0.05) per share, in Q3 2023 and a Non-GAAP net loss of $(2.7) million, or $(0.11) per share, in Q2 2024. The year-over-year increase in Non-GAAP net loss was driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses. \n\n**($ in 000, except per share)** |  **Three months ended September 30,** |  **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Change in % Favorable/(Adverse)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change in % Favorable/(Adverse)**  \n**GAAP**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  2,504  |  $  |  4,889  |  (49  |  )  |  $  |  8,430  |  $  |  14,550  |  (42  |  )   \nGross profit  |  612  |  1,616  |  (62  |  )  |  1,743  |  4,779  |  (64  |  )   \nOperating expenses  |  2,800  |  3,105  |  10  |  8,933  |  9,812  |  9   \nOperating loss  |  (2,188  |  )  |  (1,489  |  )  |  (47  |  )  |  (7,190  |  )  |  (5,033  |  )  |  (43  |  )   \nNet loss  |  (2,062  |  )  |  (1,351  |  )  |  (53  |  )  |  (6,780  |  )  |  (3,202  |  )  |  (112  |  )   \nDiluted loss per share  |  (0.09  |  )  |  (0.06  |  )  |  (50  |  )  |  (0.28  |  )  |  (0.13  |  )  |  (115  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP**  \nNon-GAAP operating expenses  |  $  |  2,738  |  $  |  2,933  |  7  |  $  |  8,670  |  $  |  9,349  |  7   \nNon-GAAP operating loss  |  (2,118  |  )  |  (1,315  |  )  |  (61  |  )  |  (6,908  |  )  |  (4,565  |  )  |  (51  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net loss  |  (1,992  |  )  |  (1,177  |  )  |  (69  |  )  |  (6,498  |  )  |  (4,084  |  )  |  (59  |  )   \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA  |  (1,982  |  )  |  (1,006  |  )  |  (97  |  )  |  (6,597  |  )  |  (3,395  |  )  |  (94  |  )   \nNon-GAAP diluted loss per share  |  (0.08  |  )  |  (0.05  |  )  |  (60  |  )  |  (0.27  |  )  |  (0.17  |  )  |  (59  |  )   \n  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $3.0 million, as compared with $22.2 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**About ClearOne**\n\nClearOne is a global company that designs, develops, and sells conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of its advanced comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability, and scalability.

These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of ClearOne’s underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before certain gains, losses, or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross profit, operating income (loss), net income (loss), income (loss) per share or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies, including companies in ClearOne’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than ClearOne does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in this release below. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on present circumstances and on ClearOne’s predictions with respect to events that have not occurred, that may not occur, or that may occur with different consequences and timing than those now assumed or anticipated. Such forward-looking statements and any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations and forecasts of future growth and value are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward-looking statements.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nAugust 15, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/17776/pdf)\n\n_- Sequential and Year-over-Year OpEx Reductions Reflect Continued Benefits of Cost Optimization Initiatives-_\n\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2024-- ClearOne (NASDAQ: CLRO), a global provider of audio and visual communication solutions, reported financial results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024. \n\nRevenue declined 58% sequentially and 39% year over year, primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from the audio conferencing category, which includes our DSP mixer products. “We believe this revenue decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of past production shortages,” said Derek Graham, CEO of ClearOne. “Historically, we have seen a lag of several months between the time that our professional conferencing products are specified for a project and the date when those products are purchased for installation. Since our product availability was constrained through a significant part of Q4 2023 as a result of delays in the transition of outsourced manufacturing from China to Singapore throughout 2023, we believe our revenue was impacted negatively by these market dynamics through much of Q2 2024. We have also faced sales headwinds from our products’ lack of Microsoft Teams certification, despite their longtime functional compatibility with this platform. Our work through early 2024 has focused on mitigating these impacts through maintaining consistent dialogues, product demonstrations, and feedback cycles with end users and channel partners, along with improving our visibility at key industry events. Our sales in Q2 2024 were also impacted by our transition to a new distributor in the Middle East. We anticipate, although there can be no assurance, that our new Middle East distributor will continue our previous history of sales growth in the region, but there was an impact to our sales in that region due to the transition.” \n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n  * The Company showcased its full line of collaboration and conferencing solutions at Infocomm 2024, including seamless integration with popular collaboration solutions from other companies and a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for various applications and meeting room sizes. The Company captured 60% more sales leads due to in-person visitors during Infocomm USA 2024 compared to Infocomm USA 2023. \n  * The Company introduced the Versa Lite BMA 360D in Q2 2024. This innovative bundle combines ClearOne’s industry-leading BMA 360D Dante® enabled microphone array ceiling tile with the Versa® USB22D Dante® adapter, offering a perfect audio solution for any conferencing space with an easy connection to any computer or room device via USB. \n  * The Company reduced operating expenses by 10.1% sequentially and 9.33% year-over-year. \n\n\n\nGraham continued, “During the first half of 2024, our team has been diligently working to win back customers who have defected to competing brands. We believe, although there can be no assurance, those efforts will bear fruit soon. We continue to see strong interest in our innovative products as demonstrated by the 60% increase in visitors at our Infocomm USA booth even though overall Infocomm USA attendance was only up 3% this year.” \n\n**Financial Summary**\n\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles those to GAAP measures in the attached tables. \n\n• |  Q2 2024 revenue was $2.3 million, compared to $5.5 million in Q2 2023 and $3.6 million in Q1 2024. The 36.1% sequential decrease was driven by reduced demand across all product categories. We believe the flow of sales orders during Q2 2024 was reduced due to the cumulative impact of past product shortages. We believe the revenue decrease was mainly due to sustained inventory sourcing and order fulfillment challenges for the Company's core audio conferencing and beam forming microphone arrays as a result of delays in the transition of outsourced manufacturing from China to Singapore throughout 2023.   \n---|---  \n• |  GAAP gross profit/(loss) in Q2 2024 was $(0.02) million, compared to $1.8 million in Q2 2023 and $1.2 million in Q1 2024. GAAP gross profit margin was- 1% in Q2 2024, compared to 32% in Q1 2024 and 34% in Q2 2023. The large decrease in gross profit margin occurred due to increased inventory scrap costs, increasing the inventory reserve to write down the value for certain items, and an increase in purchase price variance from increasing vendor costs.   \n• |  Operating expenses in Q2 2024 improved to $2.9 million, compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2023 and $3.2 million in Q1 2024. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 2024 improved to $2.8 million compared to $3.1 million in Q1 2024 and $3.1 million in Q2 2023. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses was mainly due to the continued benefits of the cost-cutting measures initiated in 2022.   \n• |  GAAP net loss in Q2 2024 was $(2.8) million, or $(0.12) per share, compared to a net loss of $(1.0) million, or $(0.04) per share, in Q2 2023 and a net loss of $(1.9) million, or $(0.08) per share, in Q1 2024. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.   \n• |  Non-GAAP net loss in Q2 2024 was $(2.7) million, or $(0.11) per share, compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of $(0.9) million, or $(0.04) per share, in Q2 2023 and a Non-GAAP net loss of $(1.8) million, or $(0.07) per share, in Q1 2024. The year-over-year increase in Non-GAAP net loss was driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.   \n**($ in 000, except per share)** |  **Three months ended June 30,** |  **Six months ended June 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Change in % Favorable/(Adverse)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change in % Favorable/(Adverse)**  \n**GAAP**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  2,304  |  $  |  5,483  |  (58  |  )  |  $  |  5,926  |  $  |  9,661  |  (39  |  )   \nGross profit  |  (20  |  )  |  1,848  |  (101  |  )  |  1,131  |  3,163  |  (64  |  )   \nOperating expenses  |  2,904  |  3,203  |  9  |  6,133  |  6,707  |  9   \nOperating loss  |  (2,924  |  )  |  (1,355  |  )  |  (116  |  )  |  (5,002  |  )  |  (3,544  |  )  |  (41  |  )   \nNet loss  |  (2,820  |  )  |  (1,019  |  )  |  (177  |  )  |  (4,718  |  )  |  (1,851  |  )  |  (155  |  )   \nDiluted loss per share  |  (0.12  |  )  |  (0.04  |  )  |  (200  |  )  |  (0.20  |  )  |  (0.08  |  )  |  (150  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP**  \nNon-GAAP operating expenses  |  $  |  2,830  |  $  |  3,051  |  7  |  $  |  5,925  |  $  |  6,413  |  8   \nNon-GAAP operating loss  |  (2,835  |  )  |  (1,201  |  )  |  (136  |  )  |  (4,777  |  )  |  (3,250  |  )  |  (47  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net loss  |  (2,731  |  )  |  (865  |  )  |  (216  |  )  |  (4,493  |  )  |  (2,907  |  )  |  (55  |  )   \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA  |  (2,660  |  )  |  (710  |  )  |  (275  |  )  |  (4,367  |  )  |  (2,389  |  )  |  (83  |  )   \nNon-GAAP diluted loss per share  |  (0.11  |  )  |  (0.04  |  )  |  (175  |  )  |  (0.19  |  )  |  (0.12  |  )  |  (55  |  )   \n  \n**About ClearOne**\n\nClearOne is a global company that designs, develops, and sells conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions for voice and visual communications.

These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of ClearOne’s underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before certain gains, losses, or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross profit, operating income (loss), net income (loss), income (loss) per share or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies, including companies in ClearOne’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than ClearOne does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in this release below. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on present circumstances and on ClearOne’s predictions with respect to events that have not occurred, that may not occur, or that may occur with different consequences and timing than those now assumed or anticipated. Such forward-looking statements and any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations and forecasts of future growth and value are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward-looking statements.

We invite end users and AV practitioners of all types to visit our booth to explore our powerful AV solutions. We're eager to learn about our customer and end user priorities and challenges for the year ahead and explore how we can work together to achieve success,” said Derek Graham, CEO of ClearOne. “Our booth will include a demo room where end users and AV practitioners can experience the performance of our products.” \n\nAt its exhibit, ClearOne will showcase a suite of products designed to optimize specific use-case scenarios. For enhancing BYOD collaboration, the company will demonstrate how its UNITE® 160 camera, BMA 360D beamforming microphone array ceiling tile, Versa Mediabar® Video Soundbar, COLLABORATE® Versa Lite CT conferencing system, Versa® UCS2100 Collaboration Switcher Kit, and COLLABORATE® Versa Hub transform any room into a user-friendly BYOD space. These solutions enable seamless BYOD integration through single-cable USB connections to computers, guaranteeing high-quality audio and video for all virtual collaboration participants. \n\nClearOne is also showcasing the recently released Versa Lite BMA 360D. This innovative bundle combines ClearOne’s industry-leading BMA 360D Dante® enabled microphone array ceiling tile with the Versa® USB22D Dante® adapter, offering a perfect audio solution for any conferencing space with an easy connection to any computer or room device via USB. The Versa Lite BMA 360D delivers crystal-clear audio in meeting spaces and provides simplified configuration and management ClearOne's proprietary FiBeam™ and DsBeam™ technologies ensure participants experience natural and full-fidelity audio across all beams and within a single beam. DsBeam delivers superb clarity and intelligibility through unparalleled sidelobe depth, reaching below -40 dB, ensuring superior rejection of reverb and noise in challenging environments. FiBeam brings the industry's only ultra-wideband, frequency invariant beamforming mic array technology with uniform gain response across all frequency bands, providing consistent voice pickup throughout the room. The powerful integrated amplifiers can be configured for either 4 x 15 Watt or 2 x 30 Watt output and make connecting ceiling speakers cost-effective and convenient. The Versa USB22D seamlessly integrates with the BMA 360D using Dante® audio networking. This powerful combination allows for simple setup and configuration using ClearOne CONSOLE AI Lite software and Audinate® Dante® Controller software. With support for 2x2 channels of bidirectional USB audio, the Versa USB22D gives PCs and mobile devices access to the BMA 360D's advanced beamforming capabilities. \n\nThe booth will also feature a dedicated space in which ClearOne will showcase seamless integration with popular collaboration solutions from Barco, Aver, Q-SYS, Mago, Screenbeam, Sound Control Technologies and Symetrix. Our collaboration experts will be on hand to demonstrate how ClearOne products integrate effortlessly to create a unified BYOD meeting experience. The recently launched Q-SYS Plugin for BMA 360D Microphone is also being demonstrated at the show. \n\nAlso, on display will be the award-winning DIALOG® UVHF Wireless Microphone System, which combines class-leading flexibility, Power over Ethernet (PoE) simplicity, Dante technology, and up to 350 usable frequencies. This system offers professional-quality audio conferencing, video collaboration, and sound reinforcement for a wide variety of applications and room types. The DIALOG UVHF system enables integrators, room designers, and meeting hosts to address a wide range of audio pickup needs through five lavalier, lanyard, and headset-type body microphones, two handheld microphones, a boundary microphone, and three gooseneck microphones for podium use. \n\nPowering the microphones is simple and efficient, as all models use the same 12-hour off-the-shelf Li-ion battery that can be charged via USB-C or an optional eight-bay network-connected charging dock. Firmware updates can be done over the network while the transmitters charge. The Dante-enabled system includes an eight-channel Dante Access Point to ensure optimal signal transmission and system reliability. Additionally, an optional DIALOG UVHF Dante interface provides eight Euroblock balanced analog outputs, including mixed output, USB audio output, and eight GPIOs. The lightweight plenum-rated access point offers versatile mounting options for wall, ceiling, tabletop, or pole mounting, including VESA mount holes. \n\nClearOne is also showcasing a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for various applications and meeting room sizes. For small room environments, the company is demonstrating the usefulness and flexibility of its Versa Mediabar® Video Soundbar, CHAT® 150 BT Speakerphone, UNITE® 60 4K Camera and UNITE® 20 Pro Webcam. For medium sized meeting spaces, attendees can experience the BMA 360D and Versa® USB22D solutions, UNITE® 160 camera, Versa® UCS2100 Collaboration Switcher Kit, CONVERGE® Huddle, Ceiling Microphone array, COLLABORATE® Versa® Lite CT and CHAT® 150 & CHATAttach® 150 Speakerphone.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nMay 20, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/17741/pdf)\n\n_- Microphone revenue up 31% year over year-_\n\n_-Revenue from Asia including India, the Middle East, and Australia up 18% year over year -_\n\n_-Sequential and Year-over-Year OpEx Reductions Reflect Continued Benefits of Cost Optimization Initiatives -_\n\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2024-- ClearOne (NASDAQ: CLRO), a global provider of audio and visual communication solutions, reported financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. \n\n“Revenue declined 12.8% sequentially and 13% year over year, primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from the audio conferencing category, which includes our DSP mixer products. The revenue decline was regionally concentrated, affecting the USA, Europe, and China when compared to 2023-Q1 revenues. We believe this revenue decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of past production shortages. We have also faced sales headwinds from our products’ lack of Microsoft Teams certification, despite their longtime functional compatibility with this platform. Our work through early 2024 has focused on mitigating these impacts through maintaining consistent dialogues, product demonstrations, and feedback cycles with end users and channel partners, along with improving our visibility at key industry events.” \n\n“In the first quarter, although overall revenue declined, there were some bright spots.” said Derek Graham, CEO of ClearOne. Revenue from our microphone products was up 4% sequentially and 31% year over year. Revenue from Asia, including India, the Middle East, and Australia was up 4.6% sequentially and 18% year over year. We also continued to make steady progress with our cost optimization efforts, reducing operating expenses by 2.7% sequentially and 7.8% year-over-year.” \n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Launched the DIALOG® 20 USB wireless microphone system at Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) 2024, a major global audiovisual expo. ClearOne’s booth at ISE 2024 recorded a 319% increase in unique visitors compared to the number of unique visitors the Company’s booth recorded in 2023. The DIALOG® UVHF Wireless Microphone System also received AV Technology Magazine’s Best in Show award at ISE 2024, having previously garnered other notable industry awards in 2023. \n  * Announced a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share of ClearOne common stock, payable on April 10, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 2, 2024. \n  * Regained compliance with NASDAQ’s minimum bid requirement. \n\n\n\nGraham continued: “Moving into the second quarter, we are working to build on the revenue growth we have experienced in Asia including India and the Middle East, while working to win back our customers in other global regions, including the Americas, who have defected to competing audio conferencing brands due to our lack of product availability throughout much of 2023. Historically, we have seen a lag of several months between the time that our professional conferencing products are specified for a project and the date when those products are purchased and installed. Since our product availability was constrained through a significant part of Q4 2023, we believe our revenue could be impacted negatively by these market dynamics through much of Q2 2024.” \n\n**Financial Summary**\n\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles those to GAAP measures in the attached tables. \n\n●  |  Q1 2024 revenue was $3.6 million, compared to $4.2 million in Q1 2023 and $4.2 million in Q4 2023. The 0% sequential decrease was driven by reduced demand all product categories except our cameras. We believe the flow of sales orders at the end of Q3 2023 slowed down considerably due to the cumulative impact of past product shortages. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to sustained inventory sourcing and order fulfillment challenges for the Company’s core audio conferencing and beamforming microphone arrays as a result of delays in the transition of outsourced manufacturing from China to Singapore.   \n---|---  \n●  |  GAAP gross profit in Q1 2024 was $1.2 million, compared to $1.3 million in Q1 2023 and $1.6 million in Q4 2023. GAAP gross profit margin was 32% in Q1 2024, compared to 38% in Q4 2023 and 31% in Q1 2023. Gross profit margin improved by approximately 1% year-over-year due to reduced inventory obsolescence costs. Gross profit margin decreased by 13% sequentially due to increased administration and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and change in the revenue mix of the products.   \n●  |  Operating expenses in Q1 2024 improved to $3.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in Q1 2023 and $3.3 million in Q4 2023. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 2024 improved to $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million in Q4 2023 and $3.4 million in Q1 2023. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses was mainly due to the continued benefits of the cost-cutting measures initiated in 2022.   \n●  |  GAAP net loss in Q1 2024 was $(1.9) million, or $(0.08) per share, compared to a net loss of $(0.8) million, or $(0.03) per share, in Q1 2023 and a net income of $2.6 million, or $0.11 per share, in Q4 2023. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and increase in interest income. The sequential decrease in net loss was primarily due to one time receipt of cross licensing agreement.   \n●  |  Non-GAAP net loss in Q1 2024 was $(1.8) million, or $(0.07) per share, compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of $(2.0) million, or $(0.09) per share, in Q1 2023 and a Non-GAAP net loss of $(1.2) million, or $(0.05) per share, in Q4 2023. The year-over-year decrease in Non-GAAP net loss was driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue and gross profit partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and increase in interest income. The sequential increase in Non-GAAP net loss was primarily due to receipt of tax refund in Q4 2023.   \n**($ in 000, except per share)** |  **Three months ended March 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Change in % Favorable/(Adverse)**  \n**GAAP**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  3,622  |  $  |  4,178  |  (13  |  )   \nGross profit  |  1,151  |  1,315  |  (12  |  )   \nOperating expenses  |  3,229  |  3,504  |  8   \nOperating loss  |  (2,078  |  )  |  (2,189  |  )  |  5   \nNet loss  |  (1,898  |  )  |  (832  |  )  |  (128  |  )   \nDiluted loss per share  |  (0.08  |  )  |  (0.03  |  )  |  (167  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP**  \nNon-GAAP operating expenses  |  $  |  3,095  |  $  |  3,365  |  8   \nNon-GAAP operating loss  |  (1,942  |  )  |  (2,048  |  )  |  5   \nNon-GAAP net loss  |  (1,762  |  )  |  (2,041  |  )  |  14   \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA  |  (1,764  |  )  |  (1,678  |  )  |  (5  |  )   \nNon-GAAP diluted loss per share  |  (0.07  |  )  |  (0.09  |  )  |  22   \n  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $22.6 million, as compared with $22.2 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**About ClearOne**\n\nClearOne is a global company that designs, develops, and sells conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions for voice and visual communications.

These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of ClearOne’s underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before certain gains, losses, or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross profit, operating income (loss), net income (loss), income (loss) per share or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies, including companies in ClearOne’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than ClearOne does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in this release below. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on present circumstances and on ClearOne’s predictions with respect to events that have not occurred, that may not occur, or that may occur with different consequences and timing than those now assumed or anticipated. Such forward-looking statements and any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations and forecasts of future growth and value are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward-looking statements.
