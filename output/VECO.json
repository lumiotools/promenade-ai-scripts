These Non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as: share-based compensation expense; charges relating to restructuring initiatives; non-cash asset impairments; certain other non-operating gains and losses; and acquisition-related items such as transaction costs, non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets, and certain integration costs.\n\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures may be different from Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. By excluding these items, Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to facilitate meaningful comparisons to historical operating results, competitors’ operating results, and estimates made by securities analysts. Management is evaluated on key performance metrics including Non-GAAP Operating income (loss), which is used to determine management incentive compensation as well as to forecast future periods. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, similar Non-GAAP financial measures have historically been reported to investors; the inclusion of comparable numbers provides consistency in financial reporting. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data (Q3 2024)** (in thousands) (unaudited)  \n---  \n**Non-GAAP Adjustments**  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**| **GAAP**| **Share-BasedCompensation**| **Amortization**| **Other**| **Non-GAAP**  \nNet sales| $| 184,807| $| 184,807  \nGross profit| 79,211| 1,565| 162| 80,938  \nGross margin| 42.9| %| 43.8| %  \nOperating expenses| 54,876| (7,894| )| (1,687| )| 4,644| 49,939  \nOperating income| 24,335| 9,459| 1,687| (4,482| )| ^| 30,999  \nNet income| 21,951| 9,459| 1,687| (4,836| )| ^| 28,261  \n  \n_________________^ - See table below for additional details.\n\n**Other Non-GAAP Adjustments (Q3 2024)** (in thousands) (unaudited)  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \nChanges in contingent consideration| $| (4,644| )  \nRelease of inventory fair value step-up associated with the Epiluvac purchase accounting| 162  \nSubtotal| (4,482| )  \nNon-cash interest expense| 323  \nNon-GAAP tax adjustment *| (677| )  \nTotal Other| $| (4,836| )  \n  \n_________________* The ‘with or without’ method is utilized to determine the income tax effect of all Non-GAAP adjustments.\n\n**Net Income per Common Share (Q3 2024)** (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited)  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n**GAAP**| **Non-GAAP**  \n**Numerator:**  \nNet income| $| 21,951| $| 28,261  \nInterest expense associated with 2025 and 2027 Convertible Senior Notes| 515| 466  \nNet income available to common shareholders| $| 22,466| $| 28,727  \n**Denominator:**  \nBasic weighted average shares outstanding| 56,410| 56,410  \nEffect of potentially dilutive share-based awards| 1,606| 1,606  \nDilutive effect of 2025 Convertible Senior Notes| 1,104| 1,104  \nDilutive effect of 2027 Convertible Senior Notes (1)| 1,788| 1,354  \nDilutive effect of 2029 Convertible Senior Notes| 1,746| 1,746  \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding| 62,654| 62,220  \n**Net income per common share:**  \nBasic| $| 0.39| $| 0.50  \nDiluted| $| 0.36| $| 0.46  \n  \n_________________(1) - The non-GAAP incremental dilutive shares includes the impact of the Company’s capped call transaction issued concurrently with our 2027 Notes, and as such, an effective conversion price of $18.46 is used when determining incremental shares to add to the dilutive share count.

The above calculations are intended to be estimates only, and reflect the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS purposes. The EPS thresholds mentioned above represent various ranges at which\nsome of our Convertible Notes may become dilutive. No shares are added for dilution purposes if the addition of such shares (and reduced interest expense) would be anti-dilutive.\n* The non-GAAP incremental dilutive shares includes the impact of the Company’s capped call transactions issued concurrently with our 2027 Convertible Notes, and assumes an average per share stock price above $18.46.\n** The Company is required to settle the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes in cash, and has the option to settle the excess above principal in any combination of cash or shares. As such, only “in-the-money” shares above the implied conversion price of $29.22\nare added to the diluted share count, and there is no interest expense add-back to the numerator for purposes of calculating diluted EPS.\nNote on Reconciliation Tables\nThese tables include financial measures adjusted for the impact of certain items; these financial measures are\ntherefore not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude items such as: share-based compensation expense; charges relating to restructuring\ninitiatives; non-cash asset impairments; certain other non-operating gains and losses; and acquisition-related items\nsuch as transaction costs, non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets, incremental transaction-related\ncompensation, and certain integration costs.\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures may be different from Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. By excluding these items, Non-GAAP financial measures are intended\nto facilitate meaningful comparisons to historical operating results, competitors' operating results, and estimates made\nby securities analysts. Management is evaluated on key performance metrics including Non-GAAP Operating Income,\nwhich is used to determine management incentive compensation as well as to forecast future periods.\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental\ninformation used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, similar Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures have historically been reported to investors; the inclusion of comparable numbers provides\nconsistency in financial reporting. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used in this news release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSupplemental Information—GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n$ millions, except per share amounts Q2 24 Q3 24\n$ millions Q2 24 Q3 24 GAAP Basic weighted average shares 56.3 56.4\nGAAP Diluted weighted average shares 62.5 62.7\nNet sales $175.9 $184.8\nGAAP Basic EPS $0.27 $0.39\nGAAP gross profit 75.4 79.2\nGAAP Diluted EPS $0.25 $0.36\nGAAP gross margin 42.9% 42.9%\nGAAP Net income $15.2 $22.0\nAdd: Share-based comp 1.4 1.6\nAdd: Share-based comp 9.2 9.5\nAdd: Release of inventory fair value step-up for - 0.2\npurchase accounting Add: Amortization 1.8 1.7\nNon-GAAP gross profit $76.8 $80.9 Add: Changes in contingent consideration 0.5 (4.6)\nNon-GAAP gross margin 43.7% 43.8% Add: Release of inventory fair value step-up for purchase accounting - 0.2\nAdd: Non-cash interest expense 0.3 0.3\nIn millions Q2 24 Q3 24\nAdd: Tax adjustment from GAAP to Non-GAAP (1.4) (0.7)\nGAAP Net income $15.2 $22.0 Non-GAAP net income 25.7 28.3\nAdd: Share-based comp 9.2 9.5 Non-GAAP basic EPS $0.46 $0.50\nAdd: Amortization 1.8 1.7 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $0.42 $0.46\nAdd: Changes in contingent consideration 0.5 (4.6) Non-GAAP basic weighted average shares 56.3 56.4\nNon-GAAP diluted weighted average shares 62.1 62.2\nAdd: Release of inventory fair value step-up for - 0.2\npurchase accounting In millions Q2 24 Q3 24\nAdd: Interest expense (income) (0.3) (0.3) GAAP operating expenses $58.4 $54.9\nAdd: Tax expense 2.1 2.7 Share-based compensation (7.8) (7.9)\nNon-GAAP operating income $28.5 $31.0 Amortization (1.8) (1.7)\nOther (0.5) 4.6\nNon-GAAP operating expenses $48.3 $49.9\nAmounts may not calculate precisely due to rounding.\nQ3 2024 Actual: GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n$ millions Non-GAAP Adjustments\nShare-Based\nGAAP Compensation Amortization Other Non-GAAP\nNet Sales $184.8 $184.8\nGross Profit 79.2 1.6 — 0.2 80.9\nGross Margin 42.9% 43.8%\nOperating Expenses $54.9 (7.9) (1.7) 4.6 $49.9\nOperating Income $24.3 9.5 1.7 (4.5) $31.0\nNet Income $22.0 9.5 1.7 (4.8) $28.3\nIncome per Diluted Common Share\nOther Non-GAAP Adjustments\nGAAP Non-GAAP\nChanges in contingent consideration ($4.6)\nNet Income $22.0 $28.3\nRelease of inventory fair value step-up associated with the\n0.2 Add: Interest on Convertible Senior Notes 0.5 0.4\nEpiluvac purchase accounting\nNet income available to common shareholders 22.5 28.7\nSubtotal (4.5)\nNon-cash Interest Expense 0.3 Basic weighted average common shares 56.4 56.4\nAdd: Dilutive effect of share-based awards 1.6 1.6\nNon-GAAP tax adjustment (0.7)\nAdd: Dilutive effect of 2025 Convertible Senior Notes 1.1 1.1\nTotal Other ($4.8)\nAdd: Dilutive effect of 2027 Convertible Senior Notes 1.8 1.4\nAdd: Dilutive effect of 2029 Convertible Senior Notes 1.7 1.7\nDiluted weighted average common shares 62.7 62.2\nBasic income per common share $0.39 $0.50\nDiluted income per common share $0.36 $0.46\nAmounts may not calculate precisely due to rounding.\nQ4 2024 Guidance\n($ millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Data\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nShare-Based\nGAAP Compensation Amortization Other Non-GAAP\nNet Sales $165–$185 $165–$185\nGross Profit 70–79 2 — — 72–81\nGross Margin 42%–43% 43%–44%\nOperating Expenses $58–$60 (8) (2) — $48–$51\nOperating Income $12–$19 10 2 — $23–$30\nNet Income $10–$16 10 2 (1) $21–$27\nIncome per Diluted Share $0.18–$0.27 $0.35–$0.45\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to non-GAAP Operating Income Income per Diluted Common Share\nGAAP Non-GAAP\nGAAP Net Income $10–$16\nNet Income $10–$16 $21–$27\nShare-Based Compensation 10\nAdd: Interest on Convertible Senior Notes 0-1 0-0\nAmortization 2\nNet income available to common shareholders 10-17 21-37\nInterest income, net (1)\nIncome tax expense 3-4 Basic weighted average common shares 56 56\nAdd: Dilutive effect of share-based awards 2-2 1-1\nNon-GAAP Operating Income $23–$30\nAdd: Dilutive effect of 2025 Convertible Senior Notes 0-1 1-1\nFY 2024 Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Data Add: Dilutive effect of 2027 Convertible Senior Notes 2-2 1-1\nGAAP earnings per diluted share for 2024 is expected between $1.12 and $1.22.
