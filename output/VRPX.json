(Nasdaq: VRPX) (“Virpax” or the “Company”)** , a company specializing in developing non-addictive products for pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder, central nervous system (CNS) disorders and anti-viral barrier indications, today announced results from a minipig Dose Range Finding (“DRF”) study for Probudur. Probudur is the company’s long-acting liposomal bupivacaine formulation injected at a wound site to provide both immediate and extended pain relief.\n\nThe DRF study was conducted to evaluate the tolerance of Probudur in an incisional wound healing model in minipigs. Probudur was injected locally into the tissue surrounding the incision area. All of the minipigs demonstrated positive tolerance to Probudur and no adverse effects were noted. The development program for Probudur continues to support the Company’s belief that Probudur has the potential to provide both immediate and sustained pain relief at the incisional area.\n\n“These positive study results in our pharmacokinetics and safety studies for Probudur and continue to demonstrate both immediate relief as well as sustained relief at the wound site,” stated Jatinder Dhaliwal, Chief Executive Officer of Virpax. “The completion of these studies brings us another step closer to filing our Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for Probudur.”\n\nProbudur is being developed to achieve the overall goal of safe and effective pain control during the perioperative period and significantly reduce or eliminate the need for opioids after surgery in approved indications. Probudur is a local anesthetic that binds to the sodium channel, preventing pain signals from reaching the brain. In preclinical studies, Probudur has shown long duration pain control for at least 96 hours, with a rat incisional model demonstrating analgesia for up to five days and _in vitro_ studies demonstrating a slow release of bupivacaine that lasted for up to six days.\n\n**About Virpax Pharmaceuticals**\n\nVirpax is developing branded, non-addictive pain management products candidates using its proprietary technologies to optimize and target drug delivery. Virpax is initially seeking FDA approval for two prescription drug candidates that employ two different patented drug delivery platforms. Probudur™ is a single injection liposomal bupivacaine formulation being developed to manage post-operative pain and Envelta™ is an intranasal molecular envelope enkephalin formulation being developed to manage acute and chronic pain, including pain associated with cancer. Virpax is also using its intranasal Molecular Envelope Technology (MET) to develop one other prescription product candidate, NobrXiol™, which is being developed for the nasal delivery of a pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol (CBD) for the management of rare pediatric epilepsy. Virpax has competitive cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) for two of its prescription drug candidates, one with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one with the Department of Defense (DOD). Virpax is also seeking partners for two nonprescription product candidates: AnQlar, which is being developed to inhibit viral replication caused by influenza or SARS-CoV-2, and Epoladerm™, which is a topical diclofenac spray film formulation being developed to manage pain associated with osteoarthritis.

(Nasdaq: VRPX) (“Virpax” or the “Company”)** , a company specializing in developing pharmaceutical products for pain management, announced that it has been granted an extension of its cooperative research and development agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), an institute/center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This collaboration is for the continued development of Virpax’s product candidate, NES100, an intranasal peptide, for the management of acute and chronic non-cancer pain.\n\nNES100 is an enkephalin drug product based on a type of nanotechnology delivery approach. Enkephalin is a naturally occurring (endogenous) peptide that is not easily administered in its original form. We believe that the nanotechnology may enable and enhance the delivery of this metabolically labile peptide drug into the brain. NES100 is the first investigational product formulation delivered via the nasal route with the potential to enhance enkephalin transport to the brain. NES100 uses a preassembled device and cartridge to propel the enkephalin formulation through the nose to the brain by flowing along the olfactory nerve pathway. The Molecular Envelope Technology (MET) is designed to protect and help carry the drug to the brain with the goal of promptly suppressing pain by binding to the delta opioid receptors. NES100 has demonstrated analgesic potential in animal models without the development of opioid tolerance, withdrawal, respiratory depression, euphoria, or addiction associated with use of opioids.\n\nJatinder Dhaliwal, Chief Executive Officer of Virpax, commented, “We are excited that this collaboration has been extended with NCATS and the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative as we believe that it may help Virpax develop an effective and safe alternative to conventional opioids used by patients to manage acute and chronic pain. We believe that the NIH/NCATS collaborative agreement will enable our team to maintain momentum in both our pre-clinical and clinical development strategies.”\n\n**About Virpax Pharmaceuticals**\n\nVirpax is developing branded, non-addictive pain management products candidates using its proprietary technologies to optimize and target drug delivery.

Such forward-looking statements are characterized by future or conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “continue” or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information._\n\n_Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to the risk factors contained in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available for review at[www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54152163&newsitemid=20241113536623&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=3&md5=897a36e092d095e654d6c572327dcbf9). Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict those events or how they may affect the Company. If a change to the events and circumstances reflected in the Company’s forward-looking statements occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results may vary materially from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements._\n\n_Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise._\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241113536623/en/>\n\n**For further information, please contact:**\n\n**Investor Contact**info@virpaxpharma.com\n\n## Recent News\n\n  * November 22, 2024\n\n## [Virpax Announces Positive Results for the Swine Model Dose Range Finding Study for Probudur™](https://virpaxpharma.com/2024/11/22/virpax-announces-positive-results-for-the-swine-model-dose-range-finding-study-for-probudur/)\n\n  * November 21, 2024\n\n## [Virpax Announces Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the Developmental Extension for NES100 Towards IND for Acute and Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Alternative](https://virpaxpharma.com/2024/11/21/virpax-announces-agreement-with-the-u-s-department-of-health-and-human-services-for-the-developmental-extension-for-nes100-towards-ind-for-acute-and-chronic-non-cancer-pain-alternative/)\n\n  * November 15, 2024\n\n## [Virpax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
