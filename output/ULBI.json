While we are not satisfied with these results, they do illustrate how fluctuations in order timing and periodic disruptions in our supply chain can impact our business on a short-term basis,” said Mike Manna, President and Chief Executive Officer. “I am thrilled we completed our acquisition of Electrochem on October 31st. We look forward to implementing our integration playbook to advance our strategy of more fully realizing the operating leverage of our business model through scale and manufacturing cost efficiencies, while creating highly attractive opportunities to further drive revenue growth through heightened cross-selling and extending our reach into underserved adjacent markets.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nRevenue was $35.7 million compared to revenue of $39.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Battery & Energy Products sales increased 1.9% to $32.5 million, compared to $31.9 million last year, reflecting increases of 28.9% in government/defense sales and 1.5% in oil & gas market sales, partially offset by a 12.4% decrease in medical battery sales and a 10.9% decline in other industrial market sales. Communications Systems sales decreased 58.2% to $3.2 million compared to $7.6 million for the same period last year, attributable to shipments in the prior year of vehicle-amplifier adaptors to a global defense contractor for the U.S. Army and of integrated systems of amplifiers and radio vehicle mounts to a major international defense contractor. Our total backlog exiting the third quarter was $78.0 million.\n\nGross profit was $8.7 million, or 24.3% of revenue, compared to $9.8 million, or 24.8% of revenue, for the same quarter a year ago. Battery & Energy Products’ gross margin increased 50 basis points to 24.7%, compared to 24.2% last year, primarily due to higher cost absorption resulting from higher factory volume in our Newark, NY facility, partially offset by inefficiencies caused by delays in the receipt of some raw material components. Communications Systems gross margin was 20.1% compared to 27.0% last year, due to lower production volume and unfavorable product mix.\n\nOperating expenses were $8.2 million, compared to $7.6 million for the 2023 third quarter, reflecting investments in new product development, the addition of sales resources to support future growth, and the recognition of legal and other fees recognized in the period directly relating to the signing of the stock purchase agreement on September 27th to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. Operating expenses were 22.9% of revenue compared to 19.3% of revenue for the year-earlier period.\n\nOperating income was $0.5 million compared to $2.1 million last year. Driven by the 58.2% decline in Communications Systems sales and one-time acquisition costs, operating margin decreased to 1.4% compared to 5.4% last year.\n\nNet income was $0.3 million or $0.02 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, compared to $1.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, or 5.4% of sales, compared to $3.5 million, or 8.8% of sales, for the year-earlier period.\n\nSee the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release for a reconciliation of adjusted EPS to EPS and adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation.\n\n**About Ultralife Corporation**\n\nUltralife Corporation serves its markets with products and services ranging from power solutions to communications and electronics systems.

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation before net interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, plus/minus expense/income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing continuing operations. We reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation, the most comparable financial measure under GAAP.

We believe that this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of our results by reflecting the portion of our tax provision that will be predominantly offset by our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future.
