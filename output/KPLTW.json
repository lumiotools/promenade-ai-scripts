(“Katapult” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KPLT), an e-commerce-focused financial technology company, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are continuing to grow across key financial and operating metrics including gross originations and revenue, and we believe we are laying the foundation for the long-term success of Katapult,” said Orlando Zayas, CEO of Katapult. “As we have grown the business, we’ve also meaningfully diversified our gross originations base. In fact, in less than four years, we have increased gross originations that exclude Wayfair from under 30% to 58% of our base, and this part of our business grew 37% year-over-year during the third quarter. Katapult Pay(R) (“KPay”) continues to be a big driver of our growth with KPay gross originations increasing 86% year-over-year and representing 31% of total gross originations during the quarter. As we head into the holiday season, we intend to leverage the power of our waterfall and direct merchant relationships, KPay and targeted marketing to give our customers more reasons to shop with us and merchants more reasons to partner with us. We are excited for a strong finish to the year.”\n\n**Operating Progress: Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Leveraged our new waterfall relationship with PayTomorrow, a premier waterfall financing platform, to integrate our lease-to-own (LTO) offering in the checkout process with new merchants, including: \n    * Tire Agent, an online tire and wheels company that serves customers across the continental US\n    * BB Wheels, a tires, wheels and accessories business with customers throughout the continental US\n    * Extreme Customs, a tire, wheels and accessories company that has a nationwide customer base. Extreme Customs already has a direct integration with Katapult, which this waterfall application process will complement.\n    * We currently have 24 total merchants live on the PayTomorrow platform\n  * Continued to build momentum for KPay and our app \n    * KPay gross originations grew 86% year-over-year\n    * Launched Blue Nile and Tire Rack in the KPay marketplace, bringing the total number of merchants on the platform to 30\n  * Launched a pilot of product-based search that upgrades our search functionality. Instead of performing category or merchant level searches, consumers can now search for specific, potentially lower-priced products available in our merchants’ inventory.\n  * Customer satisfaction remained high and Katapult had a Net Promoter Score of 61 as of September 30, 2024. 60.3% of gross originations for the third quarter of 2024 came from repeat customers1.\n  * Subsequent to quarter end, we signed a non-binding letter of intent with a direct lender with respect to a new revolving line of credit, working capital line of credit and term loan (the “Potential Credit Facility”). If we consummate the Potential Credit Facility, the new revolving line of credit and term loan would refinance and replace our outstanding credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will consummate this Potential Credit Facility or any other credit facility with this or any other lender.\n\n\n\n**Third** **Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n(All comparisons are year-over-year unless stated otherwise.)\n\n  * Gross originations were $51.2 million, an increase of 3.3%\n  * Total revenue was $60.3 million, an increase of 10.0%\n  * Total operating expenses in the third quarter increased 37.7%. Excluding litigation settlement expenses, total operating expenses increased 9.5%. Our fixed cash operating expenses2, which exclude litigation settlement expenses, increased approximately 8.5%.\n  * Net loss was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net loss of $4.1 million reported for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted net loss2 was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.1 million reported for the third quarter of 2023\n  * Adjusted EBITDA2  was $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA2 of $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2023\n  * Katapult ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $30.3 million, which includes $4.4 million of restricted cash. The Company ended the quarter with $67.3 million of outstanding debt on its credit facility.\n  * Write-offs as a percentage of revenue were 9.5% in the third quarter of 2024 and are within the Company’s 8% to 10% long-term target range. This compares with 9.5% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n[1] Repeat customer rate is defined as the percentage of in-quarter originations from existing customers. [2] Please refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure and Certain Other Data” section and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables below for more information. \n\n**Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Business Outlook**\n\nThe Company is continuing to navigate a challenging macro environment particularly within the home furnishings category. Given the breadth of our merchant selection, our strategic marketing and our strong consumer offering, we believe we are well positioned heading into the holiday season. We continue to believe that we have a large addressable market of underserved, non-prime consumers, and it’s important to note that lease-to-own solutions have historically benefited when prime credit options become less available.\n\nBased on these dynamics and the operating plan in place for the full year 2024, Katapult expects to deliver the following results for the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\n  * 6 to 8% year-over-year increase in gross originations\n  * 5 to 7% year-over-year increase in revenue\n  * Breakeven Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor full year 2024, Katapult expects the following:\n\n  * We expect to continue to expand our customer base and acquire new customers\n  * We expect gross originations to grow 2 to 4%.This outlook does not include any material impact from prime creditors tightening or loosening above us and assumes that there are no significant changes to the macro environment.Both our fourth quarter and full year outlooks assume that the home furnishings category does not improve materially from our third quarter performance.\n\n\n  * We also expect to maintain strong credit quality in our portfolio. This will be driven by ongoing enhancements to our risk modeling, onboarding high quality new merchants through integrations, and repeat customers engaging with Katapult Pay\n\n\n  * Revenue growth is expected to be at least 10%\n\n\n  * Finally with the continued execution of our disciplined expense management strategy combined with our growing top-line, we expect to deliver approximately $5.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.\n\n\n\n\"We continue to execute our growth strategy and are focused on influencing the drivers that are within our control,” said Nancy Walsh, CFO of Katapult. “Our third quarter outlook assumed that our home furnishings category would return to its normal performance, but unfortunately we faced continued headwinds in the quarter. We offset this dynamic by taking action that supported strong performance in our business excluding Wayfair, which grew nearly 40% year-over-year. In addition we are maintaining an efficient expense structure, which, we believe, when coupled with our continued top-line growth, positions Katapult to deliver our first full-year of Adjusted EBITDA profitability since 2021. We are grateful for our team’s hard work and are looking forward to giving our customers and merchants alike a great holiday season.”\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 8:00 AM ET on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, to discuss the Company’s financial results. Related presentation materials will be available before the call on the Company’s Investor Relations page at <https://ir.katapultholdings.com>. The conference call will be broadcast live in listen-only mode and an archive of the webcast will be available for one year.\n\n**About Katapult**\n\nKatapult is a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omnichannel retailers and e-commerce platforms to power the purchasing of everyday durable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including Katapult’s ability to refinance its indebtedness, the execution of Katapult’s business strategy, launching new product offerings and new brands and expanding information and technology capabilities; Katapult’s market opportunity and its ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers; adoption and success of our mobile application featuring Katapult Pay; the timing and impact of our growth initiatives on our future financial performance and the impact of our new executive hires and brand strategy; anticipated occurrence and timing of prime lending tightening and impact on our results of operations; general economic conditions in the markets where Katapult operates, the cyclical nature of customer spending, and seasonal sales and spending patterns of customers; risks relating to factors affecting consumer spending that are not under Katapult’s control, including, among others, levels of employment, disposable consumer income, inflation, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, pandemics (such as COVID-19), consumer confidence in future economic conditions, political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security and willingness and ability of customers to pay for the goods they lease through Katapult when due; risks relating to uncertainty of Katapult’s estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth; risks related to the concentration of a significant portion of our transaction volume with a single merchant partner, or type of merchant or industry; the effects of competition on Katapult’s future business; meet future liquidity requirements and complying with restrictive covenants related to our long-term indebtedness; the impact of unstable market and economic conditions such as rising inflation and interest rates; reliability of Katapult’s platform and effectiveness of its risk model; data security breaches or other information technology incidents or disruptions, including cyber-attacks, and the protection of confidential, proprietary, personal and other information, including personal data of customers; ability to attract and retain employees, executive officers or directors; effectively respond to general economic and business conditions; obtain additional capital, including equity or debt financing and servicing our indebtedness; enhance future operating and financial results; anticipate rapid technological changes, including generative artificial intelligence and other new technologies; comply with laws and regulations applicable to Katapult’s business, including laws and regulations related to rental purchase transactions; stay abreast of modified or new laws and regulations applying to Katapult’s business, including with respect to rental purchase transactions and privacy regulations; maintain and grow relationships with merchants and partners; respond to uncertainties associated with product and service developments and market acceptance; the impacts of new U.S. federal income tax laws; that Katapult has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could affect the reliability of its condensed consolidated financial statements; successfully defend litigation; litigation, regulatory matters, complaints, adverse publicity and/or misconduct by employees, vendors and/or service providers; and other events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions (including the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict), terrorism, public health crises and pandemics (such as COVID-19), or responses to such events; Katapult’s ability to meet the minimum requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market; the effects of the reverse stock split on our common stock; and those factors discussed in greater detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Katapult’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that Katapult filed with the SEC.\n\nIf any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Katapult does not presently know or that Katapult currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this Press Release. All forward-looking statements contained herein are based on information available to Katapult as of the date hereof, and Katapult does not assume any obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law.\n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nKatapult regularly reviews several metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate its business, measure its performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions, which may also be useful to an investor: gross originations, total revenue, gross profit, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.\n\nGross originations are defined as the retail price of the merchandise associated with lease-purchase agreements entered into during the period through the Katapult platform. Gross originations do not represent revenue earned. However, we believe this is a useful operating metric for both Katapult’s management and investors to use in assessing the volume of transactions that take place on Katapult’s platform.\n\nTotal revenue represents the summation of rental revenue and other revenue. Katapult measures this metric to assess the total view of pay through performance of its customers. Management believes looking at these components is useful to an investor as it helps to understand the total payment performance of customers.\n\nGross profit represents total revenue less cost of revenue, and is a measure presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for a description and presentation of adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures utilized by management.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in this press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with GAAP, the Company also presents the following non-GAAP and other measures of financial performance: adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and fixed cash operating expenses. The Company believes that for management and investors to more effectively compare core performance from period to period, the non-GAAP measures should exclude items that are not indicative of our results from ongoing business operations.The Company urges investors to consider non-GAAP measures only in conjunction with its GAAP financials and to review the reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to its comparable GAAP financial measures, which are included in this press release.\n\nAdjusted gross profit represents gross profit less variable operating expenses, which are servicing costs, and underwriting fees. Management believes that adjusted gross profit provides a meaningful understanding of one aspect of its performance specifically attributable to total revenue and the variable costs associated with total revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest income, change in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, provision of impairment of leased assets, loss on partial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\n\nAdjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss before change in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\n\nFixed cash operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, stock-based compensation expense, litigation settlement expenses and variable lease costs such as servicing costs and underwriting fees. Management believes that fixed cash operating expenses provides a meaningful understanding of non-variable ongoing expenses.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are useful to an investor in evaluating the Company’s performance because these measures:\n\n  * Are widely used to measure a company’s operating performance;\n  * Are financial measurements that are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate the Company’s credit worthiness; and\n  * Are used by the Company’s management for various purposes, including as measures of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\n\n\n\nManagement believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are not part of our core operations, highly variable or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance. However, these non-GAAP measures exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Katapult’s financial results.

(“Katapult” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:\nKPLT), an e-commerce-focused \u0000nancial technology company, today reported its \u0000nancial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024.\n“We are continuing to grow across key \u0000nancial and operating metrics including gross originations and revenue,\nand we believe we are laying the foundation for the long-term success of Katapult,” said Orlando Zayas, CEO of\nKatapult. “As we have grown the business, we’ve also meaningfully diversi\u0000ed our gross originations base. In fact, in\nless than four years, we have increased gross originations that exclude Wayfair from under 30% to 58% of our base,\nand this part of our business grew 37% year-over-year during the third quarter. Katapult Pay(R) (“KPay”) continues\nto be a big driver of our growth with KPay gross originations increasing 86% year-over-year and representing 31% of\ntotal gross originations during the quarter. As we head into the holiday season, we intend to leverage the power of\nour waterfall and direct merchant relationships, KPay and targeted marketing to give our customers more reasons\nto shop with us and merchants more reasons to partner with us. We are excited for a strong \u0000nish to the year.”\nOperating Progress: Recent Highlights\nLeveraged our new waterfall relationship with PayTomorrow, a premier waterfall \u0000nancing platform, to\nintegrate our lease-to-own (LTO) o\u0000ering in the checkout process with new merchants, including:\n1\nTire Agent, an online tire and wheels company that serves customers across the continental US\nBB Wheels, a tires, wheels and accessories business with customers throughout the continental US\nExtreme Customs, a tire, wheels and accessories company that has a nationwide customer base.\nExtreme Customs already has a direct integration with Katapult, which this waterfall application process\nwill complement.\nWe currently have 24 total merchants live on the PayTomorrow platform\nContinued to build momentum for KPay and our app\nKPay gross originations grew 86% year-over-year\nLaunched Blue Nile and Tire Rack in the KPay marketplace, bringing the total number of merchants on\nthe platform to 30\nLaunched a pilot of product-based search that upgrades our search functionality. Instead of performing\ncategory or merchant level searches, consumers can now search for speci\u0000c, potentially lower-priced\nproducts available in our merchants’ inventory.\nCustomer satisfaction remained high and Katapult had a Net Promoter Score of 61 as of September 30, 2024.\n60.3% of gross originations for the third quarter of 2024 came from repeat customers1.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we signed a non-binding letter of intent with a direct lender with respect to a new\nrevolving line of credit, working capital line of credit and term loan (the “Potential Credit Facility”). If we\nconsummate the Potential Credit Facility, the new revolving line of credit and term loan would re\u0000nance and\nreplace our outstanding credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will consummate this Potential\nCredit Facility or any other credit facility with this or any other lender.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n(All comparisons are year-over-year unless stated otherwise.)\nGross originations were $51.2 million, an increase of 3.3%\nTotal revenue was $60.3 million, an increase of 10.0%\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter increased 37.7%. Excluding litigation settlement expenses, total\noperating expenses increased 9.5%. Our \u0000xed cash operating expenses2, which exclude litigation settlement\nexpenses, increased approximately 8.5%.\nNet loss was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net loss of $4.1 million reported for the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted net loss2 was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.1\nmillion reported for the third quarter of 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA2 was $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA2 of $0.9 million\nin the third quarter of 2023\n2\nKatapult ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $30.3 million, which includes $4.4 million\nof restricted cash. The Company ended the quarter with $67.3 million of outstanding debt on its credit facility.\nWrite-o\u0000s as a percentage of revenue were 9.5% in the third quarter of 2024 and are within the Company’s\n8% to 10% long-term target range. This compares with 9.5% in the third quarter of 2023.\n[1] Repeat customer rate is de\u0000ned as the percentage of in-quarter originations from existing customers.\n[2] Please refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure and Certain Other Data” section and the GAAP to non-\nGAAP reconciliation tables below for more information.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Business Outlook\nThe Company is continuing to navigate a challenging macro environment particularly within the home furnishings\ncategory. Given the breadth of our merchant selection, our strategic marketing and our strong consumer o\u0000ering,\nwe believe we are well positioned heading into the holiday season. We continue to believe that we have a large\naddressable market of underserved, non-prime consumers, and it’s important to note that lease-to-own solutions\nhave historically bene\u0000ted when prime credit options become less available.\nBased on these dynamics and the operating plan in place for the full year 2024, Katapult expects to deliver the\nfollowing results for the fourth quarter of 2024:\n6 to 8% year-over-year increase in gross originations\n5 to 7% year-over-year increase in revenue\nBreakeven Adjusted EBITDA\nFor full year 2024, Katapult expects the following:\nWe expect to continue to expand our customer base and acquire new customers\nWe expect gross originations to grow 2 to 4%.\nThis outlook does not include any material impact from prime creditors tightening or loosening above us and\nassumes that there are no signi\u0000cant changes to the macro environment.\nBoth our fourth quarter and full year outlooks assume that the home furnishings category does not improve\nmaterially from our third quarter performance.\nWe also expect to maintain strong credit quality in our portfolio. This will be driven by ongoing enhancements\nto our risk modeling, onboarding high quality new merchants through integrations, and repeat customers\nengaging with Katapult Pay\n3\nRevenue growth is expected to be at least 10%\nFinally with the continued execution of our disciplined expense management strategy combined with our\ngrowing top-line, we expect to deliver approximately $5.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.\n\"We continue to execute our growth strategy and are focused on in\u0000uencing the drivers that are within our control,”\nsaid Nancy Walsh, CFO of Katapult. “Our third quarter outlook assumed that our home furnishings category would\nreturn to its normal performance, but unfortunately we faced continued headwinds in the quarter. We o\u0000set this\ndynamic by taking action that supported strong performance in our business excluding Wayfair, which grew nearly\n40% year-over-year. In addition we are maintaining an e\u0000cient expense structure, which, we believe, when coupled\nwith our continued top-line growth, positions Katapult to deliver our \u0000rst full-year of Adjusted EBITDA pro\u0000tability\nsince 2021. We are grateful for our team’s hard work and are looking forward to giving our customers and\nmerchants alike a great holiday season.”\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 8:00 AM ET on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, to discuss\nthe Company’s \u0000nancial results. Related presentation materials will be available before the call on the Company’s\nInvestor Relations page at https://ir.katapultholdings.com. The conference call will be broadcast live in listen-only\nmode and an archive of the webcast will be available for one year.\nAbout Katapult\nKatapult is a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omnichannel retailers and e-commerce\nplatforms to power the purchasing of everyday durable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers.

There may be additional risks that Katapult does not presently\nknow or that Katapult currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to di\u0000er from those\ncontained in the forward-looking statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking\nstatements in this Press Release. All forward-looking statements contained herein are based on information\navailable to Katapult as of the date hereof, and Katapult does not assume any obligation to update these\nstatements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law.\nKey Performance Metrics\nKatapult regularly reviews several metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate its business, measure its\nperformance, identify trends a\u0000ecting our business, formulate \u0000nancial projections and make strategic decisions,\nwhich may also be useful to an investor: gross originations, total revenue, gross pro\u0000t, adjusted gross pro\u0000t and\n6\nadjusted EBITDA.\nGross originations are de\u0000ned as the retail price of the merchandise associated with lease-purchase agreements\nentered into during the period through the Katapult platform. Gross originations do not represent revenue earned.\nHowever, we believe this is a useful operating metric for both Katapult’s management and investors to use in\nassessing the volume of transactions that take place on Katapult’s platform.\nTotal revenue represents the summation of rental revenue and other revenue. Katapult measures this metric to\nassess the total view of pay through performance of its customers. Management believes looking at these\ncomponents is useful to an investor as it helps to understand the total payment performance of customers.\nGross pro\u0000t represents total revenue less cost of revenue, and is a measure presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below\nfor a description and presentation of adjusted gross pro\u0000t and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures\nutilized by management.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the \u0000nancial measures presented in this press release and related conference call or webcast in\naccordance with GAAP, the Company also presents the following non-GAAP and other measures of \u0000nancial\nperformance: adjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and \u0000xed cash operating\nexpenses. The Company believes that for management and investors to more e\u0000ectively compare core\nperformance from period to period, the non-GAAP measures should exclude items that are not indicative of our\nresults from ongoing business operations.The Company urges investors to consider non-GAAP measures only in\nconjunction with its GAAP \u0000nancials and to review the reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures\nto its comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures, which are included in this press release.\nAdjusted gross pro\u0000t represents gross pro\u0000t less variable operating expenses, which are servicing costs, and\nunderwriting fees. Management believes that adjusted gross pro\u0000t provides a meaningful understanding of one\naspect of its performance speci\u0000cally attributable to total revenue and the variable costs associated with total\nrevenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest\nincome, change in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares, provision for income taxes, depreciation\nand amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, provision of impairment of leased assets,\nloss on partial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\n7\nAdjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as net loss before change in fair value of warrants and loss\non issuance of shares, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\nFixed cash operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as operating expenses less depreciation and\namortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, stock-based compensation expense, litigation\nsettlement expenses and variable lease costs such as servicing costs and underwriting fees. Management believes\nthat \u0000xed cash operating expenses provides a meaningful understanding of non-variable ongoing expenses.\nAdjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are useful to an investor in evaluating the Company’s\nperformance because these measures:\nAre widely used to measure a company’s operating performance;\nAre \u0000nancial measurements that are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate the\nCompany’s credit worthiness; and\nAre used by the Company’s management for various purposes, including as measures of performance and as\na basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nManagement believes the use of non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to\ninvestors in that they eliminate items that are not part of our core operations, highly variable or do not require a\ncash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures\nwhen evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Management believes\nthat these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in\ncomparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and \u0000nancial analysts in assessing\noperating performance. However, these non-GAAP measures exclude items that are signi\u0000cant in understanding\nand assessing Katapult’s \u0000nancial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as\nalternatives to revenue, net loss, gross pro\u0000t, cash \u0000ows from operations or other measures of pro\u0000tability, liquidity\nor performance under GAAP. You should be aware that Katapult’s presentation of these measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC.

Management\nbelieves that fixed cash operating expenses provides a meaningful understanding of controllable ongoing expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest income, change in fair value of warrants and loss on\nissuance of shares, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, impairment of leased assets, loss on\npartial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company’s performance because this measure:\n• Is widely used to measure a company’s operating performance;\n• Is a financial measurement used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate the Company’s credit worthiness; and\n• Is used by the Company’s management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nAdjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss before change in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares, stock-based compensation\nexpense, and litigation settlement expenses.\nManagement believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our\ncore operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating\noperating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends\nin the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results, and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\nHowever, these non-GAAP measures exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Katapult’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not\nbe considered in isolation or as alternatives to revenue, net loss, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. You\nshould be aware that Katapult’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n| 39\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nFixed Cash Operating Expenses\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(As Restated)\nOperating Expenses $ 16,396 $ 11,909\nLess:\nDepreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software 403 247\nStock-based compensation expense 1,485 1,375\nServicing costs 1,160 1,100\nUnderwriting fees 490 422\nLitigation settlement expenses 3,352 —\nFixed cash operating expenses $ 9,506 $ 8,765\n| 40\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(As Restated) (As Restated)\nNet loss $ (8,888) $ (4,054) $ (16,346) $ (22,037)\nAdd back:\nInterest expense and other fees 4,801 4,264 14,002 13,551\nInterest income (332) (287) (1,015) (1,334)\nChange in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of\n(20) (382) 33 (771)\nshares\nProvision for income taxes 47 19 113 53\nDepreciation and amortization on property and equipment and\n403 247 932 679\ncapitalized software\nProvision for impairment of leased assets (295) (324) 307 219\nLoss on partial extinguishment of debt — — — 2,391\nStock-based compensation expense 1,485 1,375 4,428 5,678\nLitigation settlement expenses 3,352 — 3,385 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 553 $ 858 $ 5,839 $ (1,571)\n| 41\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nAdjusted Net Loss\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\n(As Restated)\nNet loss $ (8,888) $ (4,054)\nAdd back:\nChange in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares (20) (382)\nStock-based compensation expense 1,485 1,375\nLitigation settlement expenses 3,352 —\nAdjusted net loss $ (4,071) $ (3,061)\n| 42"

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Katapult Holdings Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker for today, Jennifer Kull, Vice President and Head of Investor\nRelations. You may now begin.\nJennifer Kull\nVice President of Investor Relations\nWelcome to Katapult's Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call.\nOn the call with me today are Orlando Zayas, Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Walsh, Chief Financial Officer; and Derek Medlin,\nPresident and Chief Growth Officer. For your reference, we have posted materials for today's call on the Investor Relations section of\nthe Katapult website, which can be found at ir.katapultholdings.com.\nPlease keep in mind that our remarks today include forward-looking statements related to our financial guidance, our business and\nour operating results, as noted in the earnings release and slide deck posted to our website for your reference. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are described in today's earnings release\nand our most recent Form 10-Q and which will be updated in future periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Any forward-looking\nstatements that we make on this call are based on our beliefs and assumptions today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them.\nAlso during the call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered supplemental to and not replacements for or superior to our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included with today's earnings release and is available on the\nInvestor Relations section of the company's website. Any comparisons to 2023 financial results are referencing our restated financials\nincluded in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 24, 2024. Finally, all comparisons are\nyear-over-year unless otherwise stated.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Orlando.\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nThank you, Jennifer, and everyone joining us this morning.\nWe're excited to talk to you about our third quarter performance, which improved year-over-year. Today, I'll focus my commentary\non the drivers of our results and how are we positioning Katapult for continued growth and future profitability. In addition, I've asked\nDerek to say a few words about his new role as Chief Growth Officer, his top priorities and how these efforts can accelerate our\nprogress. After this, Nancy will take us through our financial results and provide an update on our 2024 outlook.\nQ3 marked another period of across-the-board progress for us, and we're proud to deliver our eighth consecutive quarter of gross\noriginations growth. Beyond gross originations, during Q3, we delivered healthy revenue growth and solid adjusted EBITDA.\nThroughout 2024, we have successfully diversified our gross origination base by adding new direct and waterfall merchants and\nrapidly growing Katapult Pay originations. As a result, more than 58% of our total Q3 gross originations, which excludes Wayfair,\ngrew more than 37% year-over-year, up from 20% year-over-year growth we achieved in Q2.\nIn addition, for this portion of the business, applications grew by more than 50% year-over-year. Last quarter, we discussed that\nour outlook for gross originations included an assumption that we would see improvement within the home furnishings category,\nparticularly at Wayfair. During Q3, Wayfair application flow was down meaningfully. And while I will walk you through a few of the\ninitiatives we put in place to offset this, ultimately, we can't control the application volume. As a result, the home furnishings category\nfell short of our expectations.\nOverall, gross originations would have grown approximately 16% if Wayfair gross originations had just been flat compared to Q3 of\nlast year. So, we believe that when this category begins to recover in earnest, this will be a tailwind for our growth. Given the current\noperating environment, we have continued to focus on drivers that are within our control, including launching growth initiatives\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nthat are helping offset the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment. And it's important to note that we are making\nthese investments, while maintaining a very streamlined expense base. At Wayfair specifically, our efforts include strategic pricing\npromotions and surgically precise underwriting that altogether allow us to be even more targeted with our consumer offerings. Over\nthe course of Q3, these initiatives helped drive approval and conversion rates higher without eroding our risk profile.\nSo let's look at the numbers. With these initiatives in place, we were able to drive a 350 basis point improvement in approval rates for\nWayfair, a 440 basis point improvement in same-day take rates and a 60 basis point improvement in overall take rates. With that as a\nbackdrop, I'd like to walk you through some of the highlights from the rest of our business that achieved 37% year-over-year growth.\nLet's start with our Q3 progress against our merchant strategy. Our merchant strategy revolves around 3 main drivers: one, growing\ngross originations by integrating with new merchants, either through a direct integration or a waterfall relationship. Two, growing our\nmarket share with our anchor merchants. And three, ensuring we offer a variety of durable goods our customers are routinely looking\nto acquire. Starting with our integration progress, we have several new developments to discuss this quarter.\nLast quarter, we announced our new agreement with PayTomorrow, a premier waterfall financing platform. They have more than\n2,700 merchants on their platform, and we have already begun to convert these merchants to Katapult. We now have 24 merchants\nlive on PayTomorrow platform. Let me tell you about a few recent waterfall launches. In mid-October, we launched BB Wheels,\nwhich is a tires, wheels and accessories business with customers throughout the Continental U.S. We also launched a waterfall\nintegration for Extreme Customs, another tire, wheels and accessories retailer that has a nationwide customer base. We already have a\ndirect relationship with Extreme Customs, and we are very excited to expand our relationship.\nWe also launched Tire Agent, which went live in mid-October. Tire Agent is an online tire and wheels company that serves customers\nacross the Continental U.S. Given their e-commerce model, they were drawn to Katapult in large part because of the power of our\napp. They are excited about having access to the broad Katapult economy, and we are excited to welcome them to our platform.\nAutomotive is becoming a key category for us, and it has an average order value that is higher than home furnishings category.\nDuring Q3, automotive grew more than 25%, and we believe it will become an even larger part of our business over time. We're very\npleased with our partnership with PayTomorrow, and look forward to continuing to expand our relationship. These are just a few\nof our successes this quarter that demonstrate the steady progress we are making on this strategic front. As we remain focused on\npartnering with new merchants, we are also equally focused on doing more with our current merchant partners.\nLet me give you a few highlights. We've added more than 40 new merchant pathways in Q3. Pathways include new or existing\nmerchant partners that launch a new website or an in-store experience that includes Katapult as a direct or waterfall LTO offering.\nAbout 40% of the launches this quarter were with existing merchant partners, showcasing their interest in broadening their\nrelationships with Katapult. We look at these launches as incremental top line growth opportunities, as well as low-cost ways to\nexpand our brand reach.\nLet me give you another example of how our team is deepening our relationship with our merchants. Less than 6 months ago, we\nonboarded a new auto merchant that specializes in tire and wheel products. Just after 4 months, the merchant was so pleased with our\nperformance that they agreed to move us up their financing funnel. After that move, we saw average daily gross originations from\nthat merchant grow by more than 180% in Q3, which contributed to the growth we saw in the tires and wheels categories during the\nquarter.\nSimilar to Q2, we continue to work closely with our merchants to leverage the power of their marketing assets to amplify the impact\non our promotional activities. For example, we launched a variety of pricing promotions for the Labor Day holiday and several of\nour merchants promoted these across their sites, newsletters, social media and other marketing domains. Through the power of our\npartnerships, during the Labor Day sales period, year-over-year, we grew applications and approvals by approximately 29% and\n30%, respectively, leading to a nearly 50% gross originations growth during this period. And while these data points do include\nsome impact from merchants that are new to Katapult since Labor Day last year, if we look only at the week-over-week growth, we\nachieved an approximately 850 basis point improvement in take rate that led to 24% week-over-week gross originations growth during\nthe Labor Day sales period. This performance demonstrates our ability to find new ways to work with our mature merchant base to\nprofitably grow our business.\nAs you've heard, we're continuing to move with a great sense of urgency across several merchant avenues to drive growth, and we are\nattacking our market opportunity creatively and strategically, and we are delivering results. The mantra is very true when it comes to\nexecuting our strategy to drive consumer demand for our market-leading LTO product.\nLet's dive into our progress with Katapult Pay and marketing. Starting with Katapult Pay or KPay, which has continued to outpace\nour early expectations year-to-date, KPay has delivered $46 million of gross originations. And in that time period, it has grown 110%\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nyear-over-year. During Q3, KPay grew 86.1% to $16 million in gross originations and represented 31% of our total base. In October,\nwe added 2 merchants to KPay, Blue Nile, which is our first jewelry merchant on KPay and Tire Rack, further strengthening our\ngrowing position in the tire and wheel category.\nYear-to-date, we've added 7 merchants to KPay, including Newegg early in Q3, bringing the total number of merchants on KPay to\n30. During the third quarter alone, KPay applications nearly doubled. And given the growth in customer engagement with KPay, we\nfeel confident that our app is allowing us to deepen and strengthen our relationship with our customers.\nTurning to marketing. We are continuing to build this muscle with an increasing cadence of tests. Within consumer marketing, the\nmajority of our resources will remain focused on driving traffic to our app. We believe we can effectively leverage our marketing to\ncomplement the customer acquisition flow we receive from our merchant partners and keep our acquisition costs reasonable. And\nour efforts continue to deliver results, including an 83% year-over-year increase in app downloads with a 52% increase in unique app\nusers, including more than a 50% increase in quarterly active users.\nWe have also doubled the number of marketing campaigns in Q3 versus last year, set up operations that allow us to launch 2 new\nmarketing channels in early Q4, and we increased leases attributable to our Google Ads by more than 100% versus Q2 of this year.\nThis helped drive originations coming through our app, up by 37% year-over-year, which represented more than 53% of our total\ngross originations for the quarter. We also continued to make progress expanding our referral networks. And while I don't have\nanything specific to report this quarter, we are excited about several new partnerships that are on the horizon. All these partnerships\nare very focused on our app, and we expect to launch new referral partnerships in the first quarter of next year. To give you a sense of\ntheir potential impact, these types of referral partnerships could deliver gross originations in the range of a large enterprise merchant\non an annual basis.\nI'd also like to give you a quick but exciting update on our tech front. During the first quarter of this year, we previewed our intention\nto introduce a product-based search. And early in Q4, we were excited to launch our pilot of this new feature. In the past, our tech only\nallowed customers to shop at the retail level. When looking for a specific durable good, we could only show them the retailers that\nwe knew offered similar products. Now, we can show them specific inventory that is available on multiple merchant sites, giving the\ncustomer options to get the best deal. In addition, over time, this capability should provide us with more precise insights into what\ncustomers are searching for and ultimately purchasing, unlocking opportunities across business intelligence, marketing and other areas\nof Katapult.\nAs you've heard, we are taking a multipronged approach to growing our Katapult business. From the strength of our direct and\nwaterfall merchant business to our innovative KPay and app, to our scalable marketing strategy to early progress we're making on\nexpanding referral and affiliate partnerships, we believe we're well positioned to create value. We appreciate the support of our\nfantastic team of employees, our shareholders, merchants, other partners and customers as we continue our journey.\nWe recognize that we need to move as quickly as possible to make our vision a reality, and this is one of the reasons why we\nappointed Derek to the new role of President and Chief Growth Officer. Derek has spent the last 7 years helping Katapult grow.\nHe spearheaded our direct-to-consumer efforts, scaled our global operations to support our top line growth and led several cross-\nfunctional teams spanning product, technology, and operations that have allowed us to expand our business. He's a terrific partner to\nboth Nancy and me.\nSo before Nancy walks us through our financial results, I'd like to have Derek give a few insights on his top priorities and how we will\nrelentlessly pursue profitable growth opportunities. Derek?\nDerek Medlin\nPresident & Chief Growth Officer\nThanks, Orlando.\nLet me start by saying how excited I'm to take on this new role at this point in the company's journey. Katapult has done a great job\nbuilding a lease-to-own offering that has a terrific product market fit, a customer experience that drives high repeat rates and loyalty,\nand an app that sets us apart from the competitive landscape. These characteristics are turning Katapult into a partner of choice for\ncustomers and merchants alike. We are shifting from simply being a payment method to a growth partner that makes shopping easier.\nIn doing so, we're diversifying our gross originations space by offering direct waterfall and Katapult Pay LTO options that meet\nconsumers wherever they are. We have also successfully grown gross originations for 8 consecutive quarters while remaining focused\non fiscal discipline. In order to accelerate our top line growth even more, we are focused on new opportunities to drive more volume\nto the top of our funnel. You've heard us talk about the testing and learning we've been doing within marketing, and those efforts\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\ncontinue to have positive impact. But our approach to marketing must be measured given that the investment required to scale\ncustomer acquisition and brand campaigns. And frankly, we need to move faster.\nTo do this, we must significantly increase our application flow. This is our #1 priority. So together with the team, we have ramped up\nactivities that are allowing us to go deeper with our current partners, identify new partners that can bring new customer populations\nto Katapult. And at the same time, we are supporting merchants with marketing collaborations that bring our consumer community,\nwhich translates to meaningful volume to their retail doorsteps. We have been aggressively expanding our coverage of enterprise and\nomnichannel merchants.\nAs merchants continue to look for growth wherever they can find it, the tone of the conversations we're having with them has become\nmore and more positive. And here's why. We have built a marketplace ecosystem, and we can measure the traffic and conversion from\ntraffic we drive, as well as the traffic that comes to us from merchant partners. Our data show that if merchants bring customers to\nKatapult, we can convert them and we can also bring customers to merchants. These 2 data points have been amazing conversation\nstarters. At the same time, we know that with the power of our app, we can cross-sell and upsell consumers a variety of durable goods\noffered by merchants in the Katapult marketplace, making the growing applicant flow even more valuable to us.\nOrlando already told you that we nearly doubled KPay applications in the quarter, and that our cross-sell activity grew 62% year-over-\nyear in the third quarter. So, let me give you another data point that underscores why our app is so important to our future; lifetime\nvalue. When a customer uses the Katapult app, this channel increases their lifetime lease originations by more than 2x. If we can\nrapidly grow our overall application volume, like I believe we can, this can be a game changer for our business, one that I believe will\nignite a new engine for long-term growth. The team is energized and organized for a great fourth quarter. I look forward to updating\nyou on our progress.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our third quarter financial results. Nancy?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nThanks, Derek, and hello to everyone joining us this morning. As Orlando mentioned, we achieved growth across the board this\nquarter, and we believe we are well positioned for a strong Q4.\nLet's start with a few insights on our top line performance. We have now grown gross originations for 8 consecutive quarters. Gross\noriginations grew 3.3% to $51.2 million in the third quarter. And on a 2-year stack basis, our gross originations grew 16%. When we\nprovided our outlook for Q3, one key element was the assumption that home furnishings, including our business with Wayfair, would\nreturn to normal levels. Unfortunately, this did not happen. You have heard Orlando talk about all the ways that we are executing on\ninitiatives that are within our control, and this is why despite this headwind, we were able to drive growth in our overall business as\nwell as 37% growth in our business, excluding Wayfair. I'm very proud of the team's efforts, which are not only driving growth, but\nalso strong repeat purchase rates, cross-shopping and Net Promoter Scores.\nDuring Q3, our customer repeat purchase rate was 60.3%. Cross-shopping activity grew by approximately 62%, and our NPS\nscore was 61. On the revenue front, we delivered $60.3 million or 10% growth, which is above our outlook and reflects continued\nimprovements in productivity and efficiencies. Our collection trends also remained strong. Q3 marked our sixth consecutive quarter\nof year-over-year revenue growth. Gross profit for Q3 was approximately $11.9 million, an increase of nearly 4%. And gross profit\nduring the first 9 months of 2024 grew by nearly 17%.\nWe achieved a Q3 gross margin of 19.8%, which is within our 18% to 20% range for full-year 2024 and in line with seasonal patterns,\nwhere our margins are typically the highest in the first and third quarters. We have continued to effectively manage write-offs as a\npercent of revenue. During the third quarter, this metric was 9.5%, approximately flat compared to Q3 2023 and within our target\nrange of 8% to 10%. Our approval rate in Q3 was consistent with Q3 of last year. We also continuously review a number of other\nmetrics that are indicative of the quality of our incoming applications, approved applicants and lease origination base. These data\npoints suggest that the credit quality of applicants, approved applications and lease originations have all trended up in Q3 2024 versus\nQ3 2023.\nMoving on to expenses and profitability. Our disciplined approach to expense management, coupled with our top line growth, allowed\nus to deliver another quarter of solid adjusted EBITDA performance. Let's first talk about some of the puts and takes within adjusted\nEBITDA this quarter. During the third quarter, we entered into a $3 million agreement to settle litigation related to a matter involving\nDaiwa Corporate Advisory, or DCA. We paid DCA $1.5 million in Q4, and the remainder will be paid quarterly over the next 2 years.\nThis is an add-back to adjusted EBITDA. This was the primary driver of our increase in total operating expenses, which grew by 38%\nduring the quarter.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nExcluding the litigation expense, total OpEx as a percent of revenue was approximately the same as Q3 2023. Given the hard work our\nteam has been doing to drive revenue growth while keeping our expense structure lean, we are starting to see the benefits of operating\nleverage. Excluding underwriting fees and servicing costs, which are variable, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense,\nwhich are non-cash expenses and excluding litigation settlement and severance expense, our fixed cash operating expenses were $9.5\nmillion, an increase of 8.5% compared to last year.\nDuring the third quarter, excluding litigation settlement expenses, our loss from operations was $1.1 million in Q3 2024 versus a loss\nof $400,000 in Q3 2023. During the first 9 months of 2024, excluding litigation expense, we achieved approximately $100,000 in\nincome from operations. Based on our top line performance and our operating efficiencies, we were able to deliver positive adjusted\nEBITDA of $600,000, which was in line to slightly ahead of our Q3 outlook. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by\nincreased operating expenses. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is positive $5.8 million, a $7.4 million improvement compared to the\nsame period of last year.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $30.3 million, which\nincludes $4.4 million of restricted cash. As of the end of the third quarter, we also had $67.3 million in outstanding debt on our credit\nfacility. Regarding our capital structure and balance sheet and our upcoming June 2025 debt maturity, in October, we signed a non-\nbinding letter of intent with a lender for a new revolving line of credit, working capital line of credit and term loan. If we finalize this\ncredit facility, it would refinance and replace our outstanding credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will close this potential\ncredit facility with this lender or any other lender.\nCash flow from operations for the first 9 months of 2024 improved by $3.6 million versus the same period in 2023. Year-to-date 2024\ncash used in operations was $4.1 million compared with $7.7 million for the first 9 months of 2023. For your models, I would note\nthat as of September 30, 2024, we recorded a reserve for the $3 million DCA settlement included in accrued liabilities and operating\nexpenses, and we have included approximately 168,000 shares in our total outstanding share count as of November 1 related to the\nDelaware litigation settlement.\nTurning to our Q4 outlook. We are continuing to navigate a challenging macro environment, particularly surrounding the home\nfurnishings category. That said, we are excited about the fourth quarter and believe that given the breadth of our merchant selection,\nour strategic marketing and our strong consumer offering, we are well positioned heading into the holiday season. From a big picture\nperspective, we believe we have a large addressable market of underserved non-prime consumers and that we will benefit if prime\ncredit options become less available.\nFrom a Katapult-specific perspective, we plan to leverage the many direct and waterfall merchant relationships we have that provide\nour customers with access to just about any durable good they want and unleash the power of KPay in our targeted marketing\ncampaigns to give consumers the inspiring shopping experiences they deserve this holiday season. Based on these dynamics and the\noperating plan in place for the rest of this year, we expect the following for the fourth quarter. Gross originations growth of 6% to\n8%. Gross originations, excluding Wayfair are expected to continue to grow at a much faster pace than our overall gross originations.\nRevenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, and roughly breakeven adjusted EBITDA.\nI will note that our outlook for Q4 assumes that the home furnishings category does not improve materially from our Q3 performance,\nand that we will not see any material impact from prime creditors tightening or loosening above us. Based on our year-to-date\nperformance, we are adjusting our outlook for full-year gross originations. We now expect 2024 gross originations to grow 2% to 4%.\nWe are reiterating our 2024 revenue outlook for growth of at least 10%. Finally, we also expect to deliver $5.5 million in positive\nadjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2024. This will be the first time we have achieved positive adjusted EBITDA since 2021.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.

Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nFirst one, Orlando, what would it take to see a material change in home furnishings demand? Is it as simple as just more home\npurchases?\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nYes. Bluntly, yes. I think we're excited that interest rates are starting to come down. Home purchases are starting to pick up a little bit.\nSo, I think if that continues into 2025, we should probably see a turnaround on the home furnishing side, but we're prepared for it, let's\njust say.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nThat's helpful. And maybe I missed it, but what is the average origination size today versus 12 months ago?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nStill in the $600 to $700 range.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. So, not materially different?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nNo. We have not seen that materially change.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Perfect. And then I wanted to kind of dig in a little bit on KPay. I'm curious if there's particular products or particular merchants\nmaybe you're working with there that are driving a material part of that new demand?\nDerek Medlin\nPresident & Chief Growth Officer\nThis is Derek. Let me share a little bit more about that. It's a great question, and it's something that we're really excited about. So\nwithin the KPay and in our mobile app ecosystem, we're really excited because what we find is that the shopping activity that we see\nfrom our customers is really distributed and diversified across many different retailers. And so that means that we're seeing traffic\ngoing through major players like Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy, but also back into Wayfair and into our tire and wheel partners and\nto other segments. And really, the key here is having the breadth of offering. And as we've added different retailers to the Katapult Pay\necosystem, we found more shopping and finding those niches where customers are looking to lease different types of goods. And so\nhaving the breadth of offering has really diversified it. So it's not concentrated at all in any single merchant. It's spread across a large\nset with really kind of the top 10 major e-commerce retailers that you know pulling in the bulk of that volume.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nGreat. I appreciate that color. And then last one, Orlando, you mentioned potential referral partners in the pipeline. How long does it\ngenerally take for those relationships to mature?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nI'm actually going to let Derek answer that one since he's in charge of all the partnerships with this new role.\nDerek Medlin\nPresident & Chief Growth Officer\nYes. Great. Thanks for that. Good question. I think what's exciting is that when we initially launched the mobile app in KPay, we\nreally targeted on our existing customers. And the reason for that is that we wanted to validate that we could help customers find\naccess to new retailers, to find the goods that they're looking to lease with us and to just make the whole process easier. And as we\nhave now matured that over the last 2 years, we've expanded further and further into not only using it as a cross-shopping sort of\ndestination for existing customers to do additional leases, but also as an acquisition channel. And so we've done that through digital\nmarketing activities, but we've also found massive referral networks that have customers and segments that look a lot like ours, that\ncan help us to attract new customers to the Katapult community and to help them understand the value they can have to shop with us\nand the flexibility and transparency with our product.\nAnd so some of those, it's a flip of a switch in terms of getting access to those, which is really exciting to be able to get the flow\nquickly. But on top of that, though, the maturity or the seasoning that needs to happen is to identify what's the right value proposition\nin front of that customer, what kind of conversion rate will we see and how will they perform over time. And so Katapult takes a really\ndiligent approach to analyzing these and ramping up in some cases, slowly to ensure that we're having solid quality, solid performance\nbefore we really open the funnel up completely. But this is an area of major focus for us in the fourth quarter and going into 2025.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital.\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\nLoop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division\nSo, you gave a great update on PayTomorrow. Any update on the Synchrony waterfall integration?\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nSure. So at this stage, Synchrony has only released their pre-approval waterfall flow, which we're a part of and is active with a\nhandful of merchants. They have a broader plan to extend functionality, and we're excited to keep partnering with them. They're a\nmajor player, especially in some of these segments that we see significant growth in. And so as you know, Katapult, our platform is\nreally extensible to any of these digital and omnichannel environments that make us a partner of choice for these types of solutions,\nwhether it be Synchrony or PayTomorrow or others. And we're really leaning in to partner closely to help them to deliver new value\npropositions and to make it easy for merchants to access the combined product offering. So stay tuned. I think there's more in 2025.\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\nLoop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division\nGot it. That's helpful. And definitely encouraging news to hear about the line of credit. Just, I guess, 2 questions there. How do the\nterms compare to the terms on the current line of credit? And also, do you have any sense for, like, timing in terms of potentially\nclosing that?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nSo Anthony, this is Nancy. We can't say a lot at this point. Let's just say we're definitely pursuing market conditions, both in terms of\nthe maturity and any of the underlying covenants and whatnot. And we've been working very hard at this trying to close it as soon as\npossible.\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\nLoop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division\nGot it. Okay. And then -- so yes, it looks like your shares outstanding. I was just looking at the Q and it looked like it was up about\n220,000 or so shares. Can you just fill us in like what is -- how -- why were those shares issued? Or what exactly happened with that?\nI was just -- I just wasn't clear on that.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nSo as part of the Delaware litigation settlement, we released 168,000 shares as of November 1 -- or October '24, excuse me. And that\nis, for your modeling going forward, that will be factored in. We anticipate as New York settles that, that will be the case as well. And\nyou know from the settlement arrangement that there is a secondary over the next 12 months that we can settle either in additional\nshares or in cash.\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\nLoop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division\nGot it. And sorry, just remind me, what was the litigation in reference to?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nThat was the de-SPAC litigation that was just settled for $12 million. This is the stock component of it. We provided the cash, and this\nis the secondary piece as we move through the process. So, just Delaware has settled in terms of the shares. New York will happen\nsometime early next year.\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\nLoop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And so none of this were the warrants that you issued when you restructured the line of credit?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nNo, those have already been issued and they're taken. That was a while ago.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nI had a couple more I wanted to throw in. On fourth quarter seasonality in terms of originations, I'm curious what percentage of the\nquarter's originations generally come from that Thanksgiving, Black Friday to Cyber Monday period?\nNancy A. Walsh\nChief Financial Officer\nA fair component. As you would imagine, Q4 with retailers as being the most important quarter for them, it's going to follow with us\nas well. So it will be a significant portion.\nScott Christian Buck\nH.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Perfect. And then lastly, I just want to ask about the patent infringement lawsuit brought against you by one of your peers.\nCurious if you guys are able to, or have any comments you want to share on that?\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nSure. Just quickly, we're evaluating what's been recently filed, and there's no current impact on our financial statements, but we intend\nto vigorously defend Katapult in this matter, and that's really all we're ready to say.\nOperator\nI'd now like to hand back over to the management for further remarks.\nOrlando J. Zayas\nCEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nThanks, operator.\nOur team has done a good job developing growth opportunities throughout 2024, and I'm grateful for their hard work. We are\nfocused on the business drivers that are within our control. And as a result, we've been able to deliver nearly 40% gross originations\ngrowth, excluding Wayfair. We believe we are well positioned heading into the holiday season and are looking forward to delivering\nanother quarter of growth, momentum that we believe will carry us into 2025. We look forward to chatting with our investors as Q4\nprogresses.

All statements other\nthan statements of historical fact contained in this report, including statements regarding our opportunity, our future results of operations and financial\ncondition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking\nstatements may be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “assume” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,”\n“potentially,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future\nevents and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These statements involve known and\nunknown risks, including risks described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, uncertainties and other important factors that\nmay cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or\nimplied by the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from\ntime to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to\nwhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:\n• executing on our business strategy, including launching new product offerings, new brand and expanding information and technology capabilities;\n• our ability to refinance our indebtedness;\n• our market opportunity and our ability to acquire and retain new merchants and customers and retain existing merchants and customers;\n• customer adoption and continued growth of our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay;\n• the timing and impact of our growth initiatives on our future financial performance and the impact of our brand strategy;\n• anticipating the occurrence and timing of prime lending tightening and impact on our results of operations;\n• general economic conditions in the markets where we operate, the cyclical nature of consumer spending, and seasonal sales and spending patterns of\ncustomers;\n• factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control, including, among others, levels of employment, disposable consumer income,\ninflation, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, pandemics (such as COVID-19), consumer confidence in future economic\nconditions, political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security and willingness and ability of consumers to pay for the\ngoods they lease through us when due;\n• risks relating to uncertainty of our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth, including the home furnishings and retail\nenvironment;\n• risks related to the concentration of a significant portion of our transaction volume with a single merchant, or type of merchant or industry;\n• the effects of competition on our future business;\n• meeting future liquidity requirements and complying with restrictive covenants related to indebtedness;\n• reliability of our platform and effectiveness of our risk models;\n• data security breaches or other information technology incidents or disruptions, including cyber-attacks, and the protection of confidential, proprietary,\npersonal and other information, including personal data of consumers;\n• attracting and retaining employees, executive officers or directors;\n• enhancing future operating and financial results;\n• anticipating rapid technological changes, including generative artificial intelligence and other new technologies;\n• staying abreast of modified or new laws and regulations and complying with laws and regulations applicable to our business, including laws and\nregulations related to rental purchase transactions, U.S. federal income tax, and data privacy;\n• responding to uncertainties associated with product and service developments and market acceptance;\n• identifying material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could affect the reliability of our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements;\n• costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims;\n• litigation, regulatory matters, complaints, adverse publicity and/or misconduct by employees, vendors and/or service providers; and\n• our ability to meet the minimum requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”).\nGiven these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBusiness— Katapult Holdings, Inc. (“Katapult” or the “Company”) is a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omnichannel retailers and\ne-commerce platforms to power the purchasing of everyday durable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers. Through the Company’s point-of-sale\n(“POS”) integrations and innovative mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, consumers who may be unable to access traditional financing can shop a growing\nnetwork of merchant partners.\nThe Company experiences moderate seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, our revenue is strongest\nduring the first quarter primarily due to higher gross originations during the fourth quarter holiday season. Our first quarter revenue is also impacted by the\nfederal and state income tax refunds that our customers receive, which in the past, has led to our customers more frequently exercising the early purchase\noption on their lease agreements. Adverse events that occur could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results throughout the year.\nSubsidiaries— The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries Katapult Intermediate\nHoldings, LLC (formerly known as Keys Merger Sub 2, LLC), Katapult Group, Inc. and Katapult SPV-1 LLC, which originates all of the Company’s leases.\nKatapult was incorporated in Delaware in 2016 and changed its headquarters from New York, New York to Plano, Texas in December 2020. Katapult Group,\nInc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2012. Katapult SPV-1 LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed in Delaware in 2019.\nBasis of Presentation— The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company believes the\ndisclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Katapult Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n2. RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs described in Notes 2 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Part II, Item 8 contained on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for each of interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDescription of Restatement Errors\nThe errors identified as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are as follows:\na. Rental revenue - The Company determined that it miscalculated sales tax payable related to certain customer lease payments going back multiple\nyears. The Company performed an assessment of its sales tax liability across all jurisdictions for potential additional exposure and determined that\nthere was an overstatement of rental revenue and an understatement of sales tax payable included in accrued liabilities. The impact to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements is as follows:\ni. Rental revenues decreased $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, within the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nii. Sales tax payable increased $6.5 million as of September 30, 2023 which is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet.\nb. Cost of revenue- Correction to depreciation expense of $0.9 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related\nto property held for lease, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment, included\n6\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nin cost of revenue, for certain leases originated on or before September 30, 2023. The impact to the balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 to correct\nthis error is a decrease to property held for lease, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment of $2.5 million and a decrease to prepaid expenses\nand other current assets of $0.2 million.\nc. Unearned revenue - Correction to increase unearned revenue $2.6 million as of September 30, 2023 in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nd. Stockholders’ deficit - The impact to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit as of September 30, 2023 is an\nincrease to accumulated deficit of $12.8 million.\ne. Other errors - There are other errors not described in items (a), (b) or (c) of this note. These errors and related restatement adjustments were not\nmaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the as-previously-reported condensed consolidated financial statements to the restated amounts as of and for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 which include the following: (1) as restated condensed consolidated balance sheet, (2) as restated condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and (3) as restated condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates— The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates\nrelate to the selection of useful lives for property held for lease and the related depreciation method, impairments, and the valuation allowance associated with\ndeferred tax assets. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the\ncurrent economic environment. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported amounts in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nSegment Information— The Company is a single segment business, which provides lease payment options to consumers to obtain durable goods from\nomnichannel and e-commerce partners. Operations are aggregated into a single reportable operating segment based upon similar economic operating\ncharacteristics as well as a similar market.\nRental Revenue— Lease-to-own agreements, which comprise the majority of total revenue, fall within the scope of ASC 842, Leases under lessor accounting\nand revenue is recognized in the period it is earned and cash is collected. Property held for lease is leased to customers pursuant to lease purchase agreements\nwith an initial term: typically one week, two weeks, or one month, with non-refundable lease payments. Generally, the customer has the right to acquire title\neither through a 90-day promotional pricing option, an early purchase option (buyout) available prior to completion of the full agreement, or by completing all\nlease renewal payments, generally over 10, 12 or 18 months. On any current lease, customers have the option to terminate the agreement at any time without\npenalty in accordance with the lease term. Amounts received from customers who elect early purchase options (buyouts) are included in rental revenue. Lease\npayments received prior to their due dates are deferred and\n8\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nrecorded as unearned revenue and are recognized as rental revenue in the month in which the revenue is earned. Rental revenue also includes agreed-upon\ncharges assessed for customer lease applications. Payments are received upon submission of the applications and execution of the lease-purchase agreements.\nServices are considered to be rendered and revenue earned over the lease term.\nRevenues from direct integration leases are generally recorded net of sales taxes as sales tax is collected from each customer's lease payment and a sales tax\npayable is recorded for remittance to the respective state. For Katapult Pay transactions, all sales tax is paid by the Company upon purchase of the goods and is\nrecorded in the cost basis of the capitalzed property held for lease. Revenue is recognized for our Katapult Pay transactions when lease payments are received\nfrom customers in the month due.\nOther Revenue— Other revenue consists primarily of the sale of property held for lease (and lease agreements) to third parties and other immaterial sources of\nincome from third party relationships. The Company continues to advance its strategy to focus on additional opportunities to generate revenue, which include\nthe sale of property held for lease to third parties. The sale of property held for lease is considered recurring and ordinary in nature to the Company’s business,\nand as such, these sales are accounted for within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when performance\nobligations are satisfied. Other revenue of $0.7 million and $0.8 million was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand $2.3 million and $2.4 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nConcentration of Credit Risk— The Company’s concentration of credit risk consists primarily of cash. A portion of the Company’s cash balances exceed\nthose that are federally insured. To date, the Company has not recognized any losses caused by uninsured balances.\nSignificant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue or gross accounts receivable balance at each balance sheet date.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for 10% or more of outstanding gross accounts\nreceivable or total revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nA significant portion of the Company’s transaction volume is with a limited number of merchants, including most significantly, Wayfair Inc.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted— In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to\nIncome Tax Disclosures. This ASU will improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. This update is effective for public entities for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.\nThe Company is still evaluating the impact of this ASU.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands the\nsegment reporting disclosures and requires disclosure of segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and\nincluded within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, amounts and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosure of\na reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation\nof how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The new standard is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective\nbasis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new pronouncement will have on its financial statement\ndisclosures.\n4. PROPERTY HELD FOR LEASE, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND IMPAIRMENT\nProperty held for lease consists of furniture, mattresses, consumer electronics, appliances, and other durable goods offered for lease-purchase in the normal\ncourse of business. Such property is provided to consumers pursuant to a lease-purchase agreement with a minimum lease term; typically one week, two weeks,\nor one month. The renewal periods of the initial lease term of the agreement are typically 10, 12 or 18 months. Consumers may terminate a lease agreement at\nany time without penalty. The average consumer continues to lease the property for 8 months because the consumer either exercises the buyout\n9\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\noption (early purchase) or terminates the lease purchase agreement prior to the end of the renewal period. As a result, property held for lease is classified as a\ncurrent asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty held for lease is recorded at cost, excluding shipping costs, and is carried at net book value. Depreciation for property held for lease is determined\nusing the income forecasting method and is included within cost of revenue. Under the income forecasting method, property held for lease is depreciated in the\nproportion of rents received to total rents expected to be received based on historical data, which is an activity-based method similar to the units of production\nmethod. The Company provides for impairment for the undepreciated balance of the property held for lease assuming no salvage value with a corresponding\ncharge to cost of revenue. The provision for write-offs represents estimated losses based on historical results, which are incurred but not yet identified. Actual\nwrite-offs may differ from this estimate. The Company derecognizes the undepreciated net book value of property buyouts as buyouts occur with a\ncorresponding charge to cost of revenue. The Company periodically evaluates fully depreciated property held for lease and when it is determined there is no\nfuture economic benefit, the cost of the assets is written off and the related accumulated depreciation is reversed.\nProperty held for lease, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nProperty held for lease $ 281,521 $ 290,808\nLess: accumulated depreciation and impairment (226,698) (231,473)\nProperty held for lease, net $ 54,823 $ 59,335\nThe table below details the cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(As Restated) (As Restated)\nTotal depreciation expense related to property held for\nlease $ 33,599 $ 31,195 $ 101,800 $ 91,655\nNet book value of property buyouts 6,748 6,069 21,505 19,365\nImpairment charges 5,453 4,895 17,021 15,494\nOther (1) 2,558 1,183 5,540 4,710\nTotal cost of revenue $ 48,358 $ 43,342 $ 145,866 $ 131,224\n(1) Other consists mainly of payment processing fees, incentives and other lease related costs.\n5.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n6. DEBT & LIQUIDITY\nDebt\nOn March 6, 2023, the Company entered into the 15th amendment to the loan and security agreement (as amended, the “15th Amendment\" to the “Credit\nAgreement”) with Midtown Madison Management LLC, as agent for various funds of Atalaya Capital Management (the “Lender”). As part of the amendment,\nthe maturity date of the revolving line of credit (“RLOC”) and the senior secured term loan (“Term Loan”) was extended to June 4, 2025 and the commitments\nunder the RLOC were reduced to $75 million from $125 million. The interest rate for interest paid-in-kind (“PIK”) on the Term Loan (as defined in the 15th\nAmendment) is (A) if Liquidity is greater than $25 million, 4.5% or (B) if Liquidity is less than $25 million, 6%. The spread on the RLOC was increased to\n8.5% from 7.5%, while the spread on the Term Loan remained at 8.0%. Additionally, effective April 1, 2023, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)\nreplaced the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus a 0.10% credit adjustment spread, for both the RLOC and the Term Loan’s benchmark rate for\ninterest rate calculations. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates for the RLOC and Term Loan, were 13.8% and 17.8%, respectively, (which includes the\n4.5% interest rate applicable to PIK with respect to the Term Loan).\nIn connection with the 15th Amendment, the Company repaid $25 million of outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan and issued a warrant to purchase\nup to 80,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, which vested on September 6, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Company\nissued a warrant to purchase an additional 80,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share which vested on March 5, 2024. In\nconjunction with the 15th Amendment, the Company incurred a loss on partial extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million during the six months ended June 30,\n2023. The loss on partial extinguishment of debt is attributed to the derecognition of a proportionate amount of the unamortized debt discount, a result of\nrepaying the $25 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan.\nIn addition, the 15th Amendment also updated certain financial covenants each as defined in the 15th Amendment, including the Minimum Adjusted EBITDA\nlevels, Minimum Tangible Net Worth, Minimum Liquidity and compliance with a Total Advance Rate.\nAs noted above, the RLOC and Term Loan current maturity date are June 4, 2025. Due to the maturity date being less than one year from the balance sheet date\nof September 30, 2024, debt is classified as a current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company is currently\nseeking to refinance the loans prior to maturity in June 2025.\nA reconciliation of the outstanding principal to the carrying amount of the RLOC is as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nPrincipal balance $ 67,304 $ 60,744\nLess: Unamortized issuance costs (198) (397)\nTotal carrying amount $ 67,106 $ 60,347\nThe issuance costs are amortized over the life of the RLOC and included in interest expense and other fees in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\n11\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC.

In addition, the\n16th Amendment also updated certain financial covenants each as defined in the 16th Amendment, including Minimum Adjusted EBITDA (Trailing 3 Months),\nMinimum Adjusted EBITDA (YTD) and Minimum Tangible Net Worth. The Company is in compliance with all of its covenants as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nLiquidity\nThe Company’s principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents generated from leases and borrowings from the RLOC. Principal liquidity\nneeds for the next 12 months and beyond are to fund normal recurring operational expenses, including purchases of assets held for lease, debt obligations, and\nlitigation settlement amounts. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $25.9 million, restricted cash totaled $4.4 million, and unused\ncapacity on the RLOC was $7.7 million.\nThe Company’s revenue and operating results depend significantly on gross originations, which is defined as the retail price of the merchandise associated with\nlease-purchase agreements entered into during the period. Gross originations are a leading indicator of potential revenue streams, as a percentage of revenue is\nrecognized in the quarter in which the gross originations occur and the remaining revenue is recognized in subsequent quarters.\nThe Company’s financing is generally comprised of cash from leases and borrowings from the RLOC, which is fully collateralized by the Company’s assets.\nAs of November 1, 2024, the Company had a combined principal balance outstanding of approximately $98.6 million related to the RLOC and term loan, both\nof which mature within twelve months of the date that these financial statements are issued. Both loans were previously refinanced on March 6, 2023 to extend\nthe maturity date from December 4, 2023 to June 4, 2025.\nThe Company projects that it will not have sufficient cash available to pay off the loans upon maturity and is currently seeking to refinance the loans prior to\nmaturity in June 2025. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not\ninclude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Under the Company's debt agreements, the Company is subject to certain\ncovenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the RLOC and Term Loan as of September 30, 2024.\n7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has two stock incentive plans, the Cognical Holdings, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, (the “2014 Plan”) and the\nKatapult Holdings, Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, (the “2021 Plan”).\n12\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2014 Plan\nIn accordance with the 2014 Plan, the board of directors of Legacy Katapult could grant equity awards to officers, employees, directors and consultants for\ncommon stock. The 2014 Plan has specific vesting for each stock option grant allowing vesting of the options over one to four years. No equity awards have\nbeen granted under the 2014 Plan since October 2020 and no new equity awards are expected to be granted under the 2014 Plan.\nStock Options\nA summary of the status of the stock options under the 2014 Plan as of September 30, 2024, and changes during the nine months then ended is presented\nbelow:\nNumber of Weighted- Average\nShares Exercise Price\nBalance - December 31, 2023 322,405 $ 7.30\nGranted — —\nExercised (44,473) 4.75\nForfeited — —\nExpired (939) 87.43\nBalance - September 30, 2024 276,993 $ 7.41\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million. No stock options were exercised during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n2021 Plan\nOn June 9, 2021, the approved 2021 Plan became effective.\nIn accordance with the 2021 Plan, directors may issue equity awards, including restricted stock awards (“RSA”), restricted stock unit awards (“RSU”) and\nstock options to officers, employees, directors and consultants to purchase common stock. The awards granted are subject to either service-based and/or\nperformance-based vesting conditions. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are equity awards granted to employees that entitle the holder to shares of common\nstock when the awards vest. RSUs are measured based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards granted under the 2021\nPlan generally vest over one to four years. The total number of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 Plan is 639,467.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s RSA activity under the 2021 Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nStock Options Restricted Stock Units\nWeighted- Average\nWeighted- Average Grant Date Fair\nShares Exercise Price Shares Value\nBalance - December 31, 2023 13,865 $ 261.25 278,290 $ 34.05\nGranted — — 180,330 15.80\nExercised / Vested — — (143,434) 31.37\nForfeited — — (29,439) 28.81\nBalance - September 30, 2024 13,865 $ 261.25 285,747 $ 24.42\nStock-Based Compensation Expense— Stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million and $1.4 million was recognized for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4.4 million and $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Stock-\nbased compensation expense is included in operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n13\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $5.8 million of unrecognized compensation costs.. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of 1.6 years. The total fair value of vested RSUs as of their respective vesting dates were $2.3 million.\n8. INCOME TAXES\nThe income tax provision of $0.05 million and $0.02 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nCompany’s effective tax rate was (0.61%) and (0.66%) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 relates predominately to state income taxes for states that have net operating loss usage limitations. The Company’s\neffective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is different than the statutory rate primarily due to changes in the Company’s\nvaluation allowance.\nThe income tax provision of $0.11 million and $0.05 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nCompany’s effective tax rate was (0.75%) and (0.29%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 relates predominately to state income taxes for states that have net operating loss usage limitations. The Company’s\neffective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is different than the statutory rate primarily due to changes in the Company’s\nvaluation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of $132.9 million that expire at various dates from 2036 through 2037\nand includes $105.6 million that have an unlimited carryforward period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has U.S. state and local net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $52.2 million that expire from 2024 to 2043.\nIn evaluating its ability to realize its net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating\nresults, forecasted earnings, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, and the future realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences. The\nCompany remains in a cumulative tax loss position for the 36 months ended September 30, 2024, and determined that it is more likely than not that its net\ndeferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n9. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nAs discussed in Note 6, on March 6, 2023, in connection with the 15th amendment to the Credit Agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to\n80,000 shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, which vested on September 6, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Company\nissued a warrant to purchase an additional 80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share which are vested. The warrants are\nconsidered exercisable for 160,000 shares for little to no consideration and the shares are therefore included in basic shares outstanding at their issuance date.\nThe Company’s potentially dilutive securities, which include unvested RSUs, stock options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common\nstock, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for certain periods, as the effect would be antidilutive. Therefore, the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same in periods of a net loss. The Company\nexcluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per\nshare for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:\nThree and Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nPublic warrants 500,000 500,000\nPrivate warrants 13,300 13,300\nStock options 290,858 336,345\nUnvested restricted stock units 285,747 296,195\nWarrants issued in connection with 15th amendment to Credit Agreement — 80,000\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,089,905 1,225,840\n14\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation risk— From time to time, the Company may become involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Management is of\nthe opinion that the ultimate liability, if any, from these actions will not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company\nis not currently aware of any indemnification or other claims, except as discussed below and has accrued liabilities related to such obligations in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements when estimable and probable, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nExcept as set forth below, the Company and its subsidiaries are not a party to, and their properties are not the subject of, any known material pending legal\nproceedings.\nDCA Litigation\nOn April 9, 2021, Daiwa Corporate Advisory LLC (“DCA”), filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The\ncomplaint related to an April 11, 2018 letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) entered into by DCA and Legacy Katapult.\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company reached a settlement with DCA to resolve any and all disputes that exist between the two parties for total consideration of\n$3.0 million with half paid on October 11, 2024 and the remainder paid over the next two years. On October 14, 2024, the case was formally discontinued, with\nprejudice. The Company recognized $2.25 million in estimated loss in accrued litigation settlement liability for the payments that are due within one year from\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $0.75 million in other liabilities for the installment payments that are due after September 30, 2025 in its condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company recognized $3.0 million in operating expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the lawsuit which gave rise to the DCA settlement occurred prior to September 30, 2024.\nShareholder Litigation\nOn August 27, 2021, a putative class action lawsuit, captioned McIntosh v. Katapult Holdings, Inc., et al, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York (the “New York Action”).\nOn August 25, 2022, a purported Company stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit, captioned Saunders v. Einbinder, et al., against directors and\nofficers of FinServ Acquisition Corp. (“FinServ”) and FinServ Holdings LLC in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Action”).\nOn May 20, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle to settle the New York Action and Delaware Action for total consideration of $12.0 million,\ncomprised of: (1) a cash component of $8.5 million (the “Cash Component”); and (2) an additional component of $3.5 million comprised of the Company’s\ncommon stock (the “Settlement Shares”) and/or cash (the “Additional Component”). On July 3, 2024, the parties executed Stipulations of Settlement. In\nagreeing to settle, neither the Company nor any of the individual defendants made any admission of liability. On July 3, 2024, a motion for preliminary\napproval of the proposed settlement was filed in the New York Action and a proposed scheduling order for the proposed settlement was filed in the Delaware\nAction. On July 17, 2024, the Court in the Delaware Action approved the scheduling order and set a settlement hearing date of October 10, 2024. On July 24,\n2024, the Court in the New York Action granted preliminary approval and a settlement hearing date has been set for December 13, 2024.\nOn October 10, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery approved the settlement of the Delaware Action, dismissing all claims asserted with prejudice..The\nnumber of Settlement Shares for the Delaware Action (the “Delaware Settlement Shares”) is 275,845 shares which was calculated by dividing $2.8 million by\nthe volume-weighted average per share price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the\nhearing held on October 10, 2024 for the final approval for the Delaware Action (the “Delaware Settlement Hearing VWAP”). 108,048 of the Delaware\nSettlement Shares are considered the “Delaware Excess Settlement Shares.” The Company may either deliver the Delaware Excess Settlement Shares (reduced\nby the New York Unused Shares (as defined below)) or pay in cash the full value of the Delaware Excess Settlement Shares (reduced by the New York Unused\nShares), calculated by multiplying the number of Delaware Excess Settlement Shares (reduced by the New York Unused Shares) by the Delaware Settlement\nHearing VWAP. The Delaware Excess Settlement Shares or cash are due in two equal installments to be made on April 10, 2025 and October 10, 2025.\n15\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe final approval hearing in the New York Action is scheduled for December 13, 2024. The settlement of the New York Action requires final court approval.\nThere can be no assurance that the Court in the New York Action will grant final approval. If final court approval of the proposed settlement in the New York\naction is granted, the number of Settlement Shares for the New York Action (the “New York Settlement Shares”) will be calculated by dividing $0.7 million by\nthe VWAP of the Company’s common stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of the hearing on final approval for the\nNew York Action (the “New York Settlement Hearing VWAP”); in calculating the New York Settlement Shares (1) to the extent the New York Settlement\nShares are less than 43,839, the difference between the New York Settlement Shares and 43,839 shall be the “New York Unused Shares” and (2) any amount of\nNew York Settlement Shares above 43,839 shall be considered the “New York Excess Settlement Shares.” For the settlement of the New York Action, the\nCompany may either deliver the New York Excess Settlement Shares or pay in cash the full value of the New York Excess Settlement Shares, calculated by\nmultiplying the number of New York Excess Settlement Shares by the New York Settlement Hearing VWAP. The New York Excess Settlement Shares or cash\nwill be due in two equal installments six months and 12 months from the New York Settlement Hearing.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued a $12.0 million\nliability, including a $5.0 million litigation insurance reimbursement receivable, on its balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the New York\nAction and the Delaware Action. In August 2024, the Company paid $3.5 million in cash and the insurer paid $5.0 million into an escrow account for the Cash\nComponent of the settlements.\nFlexShopper Litigation\nOn September 30, 2024, FlexShopper, Inc. (“FlexShopper”) filed a complaint against Katapult in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,\nMarshall Division. The complaint alleges patent infringement and seeks an injunction as well as damages for alleged lost profits and willfulness. The Company\nhas not recorded any loss or gain contingencies associated with this litigation as it is not probable or reasonably estimable as of September 30, 2024. The\nCompany intends to vigorously defend this case.\n11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nCertain assets and liabilities are required to be carried at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be\nreceived for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the measurement date.\nThe Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of\nthe following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:\nLevel 1—Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full\nterm of the related assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of accounts payable, accrued expenses, warrant liability, the RLOC, and the Term Loan. The Company’s assets,\naccounts payable and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or\npayment date. The condensed consolidated financial statements also include fair value level 3 measurements of private common stock warrants. The Company\nuses a third-party valuation firm to determine the fair value of certain of the Company's financial instruments.\n16\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, for events requiring adjustment to or\ndisclosure in these condensed consolidated financial statements. Except as discussed below, there are no events that require adjustment to or disclosure in these\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nShareholder Litigation\nOn October 10, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery approved the settlement of the Delaware Action, dismissing all claims asserted with prejudice and on\nOctober 24, 2024, the Company delivered 167,797 shares to the plaintiff.\nDCA Litigation\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company reached a settlement with DCA to resolve any and all disputes that exist between them for total consideration of $3.0 million\nof which $1.5 million was paid on October 11, 2024 and the remainder will be paid in installments over the next two years. The Company recognized\n$2.25 million in estimated loss in accrued litigation settlement liability for the payments that are due within one year from September 30, 2024 and\n$0.75 million in other liabilities for the installment payments that are due after September 30, 2025 in its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, as the lawsuit which gave rise to the DCA settlement occurred prior to September 30, 2024.\nSee note 10 for further information regarding the Shareholder Litigation and DCA litigation.\n17\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”, or “Katapult” refer to Katapult Holdings, Inc and\nits subsidiaries.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and “Special Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and\nresults of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included on our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed\nwith the SEC on April 24, 2024. All dollar amounts are in thousands, unless otherwise specified.\nOVERVIEW (dollars in thousands)\nWe are a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omnichannel retailers and e-commerce platforms to power the purchasing of everyday\ndurable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers. Through our POS integrations and innovative mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, consumers who\nmay be unable to access traditional financing can shop a growing network of our merchants.\nSegment Information\nWe conduct our business within one business segment, which is defined as providing lease payment options to consumers to obtain durable goods from\nomnichannel and e-commerce partners. Our operations are aggregated into a single reportable operating segment based upon similar economic and operating\ncharacteristics as well as similar markets.\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe regularly review several metrics, including the following U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance,\nidentify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions, which may also be useful to an investor.\nGross Originations\nWe measure gross originations to assess the growth trajectory and overall size of our lease portfolio. We define gross originations as the retail price of the\nmerchandise associated with lease-purchase agreements entered into during the period through our platform. Gross originations do not represent revenue\nearned, but are a leading indicator of potential revenue streams as a percentage of revenue is realized in the quarter in which the gross originations occur. We\ncontinue to recognize revenue in subsequent quarters until 100% of revenue is recognized (on average over 8 months). Revenue from gross originations have\nhistorically reached approximately 70-75% of total revenue within two quarters from when the originations occurred. We believe this is a useful operating\nmetric for investors to use in assessing the volume of transactions that take place on our platform.\nThe following tables present gross originations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\nGross Originations $ 51,210 $ 49,591 $ 1,619 3.3 %\nWayfair represented 42% and 56% of gross originations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nKatapult Pay represented 31% and 17% of gross originations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n18\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\nGross Originations $ 162,151 $ 159,037 $ 3,114 2.0 %\nWayfair represented 46% and 54% of gross originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nKatapult Pay represented 28% and 14% of gross originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue represents the sum of rental revenue and other revenue. We record rental revenue in accordance with ASC 842, with revenue being recorded\nwhen earned and cash is collected. Other revenue is recorded in accordance with ASC 606, with revenue being recorded as performance obligations are\nsatisfied. The following tables presents total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(As Restated)\nTotal revenue $ 60,307 $ 54,811 $ 5,496 10.0%\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(As Restated)\nTotal revenue $ 184,231 $ 164,030 $ 20,201 12.3%\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents total revenue less cost of revenue, and is a measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also use adjusted gross profit as a key\nperformance indicator to provide an understanding of one aspect of our performance specifically attributable to total revenue and the costs associated with total\nrevenue.\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nAdjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP measure utilized by management, representing gross profit less variable operating expenses, which are servicing costs and\nunderwriting fees. We believe that adjusted gross profit provides a meaningful understanding of one aspect of our performance specifically attributable to total\nrevenue and the variable costs associated with total revenue. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for a reconciliation of gross profit to\nadjusted gross profit.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest income, change in fair value of\nwarrant liability, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, impairment of leased assets,\nloss on partial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides a\nmeaningful understanding of our operating performance. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA,\nwhich is a non-GAAP measure utilized by management, to net loss.\n19\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTotal revenue is comprised of rental revenue and other revenue. Rental revenue is recognized as earned when cash is collected from customers. Other revenue\nconsists primarily of the sale of property held for lease (and lease agreements) to third parties and other immaterial sources of income from third party\nrelationships, and is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, our revenue is strongest during the first\nquarter primarily due to higher gross originations during the fourth quarter holiday season. Our first quarter revenue is also impacted by the federal and state\nincome tax refunds that our customers receive in the first quarter which, in the past, has led to our customers more frequently exercising the early purchase\noption on their lease agreements. Adverse events that occur could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results throughout the year.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of depreciation expense related to property held for lease, impairment of property held for lease, net book value of property\nbuyouts, payment processing fees, and other costs associated with offering lease-purchase transactions to customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses primarily consist of servicing costs, underwriting fees, professional and consulting fees, technology and data analytics expense,\ncompensation costs, general and administrative expense and litigation settlement expenses. Servicing costs include permanent and temporary call center\nsupport. Underwriting fees primarily consist of data costs related to inputs from customer underwriting models. Professional and consulting fees include\ncorporate legal and accounting costs. Technology and data analytics expense includes technology costs and salaries and benefits for computer programming\nand data analytics employees that support our underlying technology and proprietary risk model algorithms. Compensation costs consist primarily of payroll\nand related costs and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses include occupancy costs, travel and entertainment, and other general\noverhead costs, including depreciation and amortization related to office equipment and software. Litigation settlement expenses consists of agreed upon\nsettlement amounts that are probable and estimable and associated legal fees.\n20\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\nRevenue (As Restated)\nRental revenue $ 59,609 $ 54,042 $ 5,567 10.3 %\nOther revenue 698 769 (71) (9.2 %)\nTotal revenue 60,307 54,811 5,496 10.0 %\nCost of revenue 48,358 43,342 5,016 11.6 %\nGross profit 11,949 11,469 480 4.2 %\nOperating expenses 16,396 11,909 4,487 37.7 %\nLoss from operations (4,447) (440) (4,007) 910.7 %\nInterest expense and other fees (4,801) (4,264) (537) 12.6 %\nInterest income 332 287 45 15.7 %\nChange in fair value of warrant liability 75 382 (307) (80.4 %)\nLoss before income taxes (8,841) (4,035) (4,806) 119.1 %\nProvision for income taxes (47) (19) (28) 147.4 %\nNet loss $ (8,888) $ (4,054) $ (4,834) 119.2 %\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and\ndiluted 4,341 4,130 211 5.1 %\nNet loss per common share - basic and diluted $ (2.05) $ (0.98) $ (1.07) 109.2 %\nRevenue\nThe increase in total revenue of $5.5 million, or 10.0%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was\nprimarily a result of gross origination growth becoming more efficient and strong collection efforts. We saw gross origination growth in 2024 primarily as a\nresult of our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, which we launched in the third quarter of 2022 and growth from our direct and waterfall merchants. Write-offs\nas a percentage of total revenue was flat at 9.5% (as restated in 2023) period-over-period and remains within our 8% to 10% target range. The provision for\nwrite-offs represents estimated losses based on historical results. Actual write-offs may differ from this estimate.\nCost of Revenue\nThe increase in cost of revenue of $5.0 million, or 11.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was a\nresult of higher gross origination growth and the historical collection results of our lease portfolio period-over-period, which impacts the associated\ndepreciation expense, buyout reserves, and impairment charges related to property held for lease. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased to\n19.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.9% (as restated) for the same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in total operating expenses of $4.5 million, or 37.7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023\nwas primarily due to an increase in litigation settlement expenses of $3.4 million and an increase in compensation related costs.\n21\nInterest Expense and Other Fees.\nThe increase in interest expense and other fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to\nan increase in the average outstanding principal under the RLOC period over period.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\n(As Restated)\nRevenue\nRental revenue $ 181,947 $ 161,612 $ 20,335 12.6 %\nOther revenue 2,284 2,418 (134) (5.5 %)\nTotal revenue 184,231 164,030 20,201 12.3 %\nCost of revenue 145,866 131,224 14,642 11.2 %\nGross profit 38,365 32,806 5,559 16.9 %\nOperating expenses 41,633 40,953 680 1.7 %\nLoss from operations (3,268) (8,147) 4,879 (59.9 %)\nLoss on partial extinguishment of debt — (2,391) 2,391 (100.0 %)\nInterest expense and other fees (14,002) (13,551) (451) 3.3 %\nInterest income 1,015 1,334 (319) (23.9 %)\nChange in fair value of warrant liability 22 771 (749) (97.1 %)\nLoss before income taxes (16,233) (21,984) 5,751 (26.2 %)\nProvision for income taxes (113) (53) (60) 113.2 %\nNet loss $ (16,346) $ (22,037) $ 5,691 (25.8 %)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and\ndiluted 4,289 4,059 230 5.7 %\nNet loss per common share - basic and diluted $ (3.81) $ (5.43) $ 1.62 (29.8 %)\nRevenue\nThe increase in total revenue of $20.2 million, or 12.3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was\nprimarily a result of gross origination growth becoming more efficient and strong collection efforts. We saw gross origination growth in 2024 primarily as a\nresult of our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, which we launched in the third quarter of 2022 and growth from our direct merchants. Write-offs as a\npercentage of total revenue was 9.1% and 9.3% (as restated) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and\nremains within our 8% to 10% target range. The provision for write-offs represents estimated losses based on historical results. Actual write-offs may differ\nfrom this estimate.\nCost of Revenue\nThe increase in cost of revenue of $14.6 million, or 11.2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was a\nresult of higher gross origination growth and historical collection results of our lease portfolio period-over-period, which impacts the associated depreciation\nexpense, buyout reserves, and impairment charges related to property held for lease. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 20.8% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.0% (as restated) for the same period in 2023.\n22\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in total operating expenses of $0.7 million, or 1.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023\nwas primarily due to $3.4 million in litigation settlement costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to none in the same\nperiod in 2023, partially offset by lower compensation costs.\nLoss on partial extinguishment of debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a $2.4 million loss on partial extinguishment of debt,\nprimarily as a result of our debt refinancing in March 2023.\nInterest Expense and Other Fees. The increase in interest expense and other fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding principal amount under the RLOC period over period, and an increase in the interest\nrate on the RLOC for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to gross profit and net loss, which are measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA,\nadjusted net loss and fixed cash operating expenses provide relevant and useful information which is widely used by analysts, investors, and competitors in our\nindustry in assessing performance. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and fixed cash operating expenses are supplemental measures of\nour performance that are neither required by nor presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss\nshould not be considered as substitutes for U.S. GAAP metrics such as gross profit, operating loss, net loss, or any other performance measures derived in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are useful to an investor in evaluating our performance because these measures:\n• Are widely used to measure a company’s operating performance;\n• Are financial measurements that are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our credit worthiness; and\n• Are used by our management for various purposes, including as measures of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nAdjusted gross profit represents gross profit less variable operating expenses, which are servicing costs and underwriting fees. We believe that adjusted gross\nprofit provides a meaningful understanding of one aspect of our performance specifically attributable to total revenue and the variable costs associated with\ntotal revenue. The reconciliations of gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(As Restated) (As Restated)\nTotal revenue $ 60,307 $ 54,811 $ 184,231 $ 164,030\nCost of revenue 48,358 43,342 145,866 131,224\nGross profit 11,949 11,469 38,365 32,806\nLess:\nServicing costs 1,160 1,100 3,433 3,193\nUnderwriting fees 490 422 1,490 1,370\nAdjusted gross profit $ 10,299 $ 9,947 $ 33,442 $ 28,243\n23\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest income, change in fair value of\nwarrants and loss on issuance of shares, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software,\nprovision for impairment of leased assets, loss on partial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.

The reconciliations of net loss to adjusted net loss for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(As Restated) (As Restated)\nNet loss $ (8,888) $ (4,054) $ (16,346) $ (22,037)\nAdd back:\nChange in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance\nof shares (20) (382) 33 (771)\nStock-based compensation expense 1,485 1,375 4,428 5,678\nLitigation settlement expenses 3,352 — 3,385 —\nAdjusted net loss $ (4,071) $ (3,061) $ (8,500) $ (17,130)\nFixed Cash Operating Expenses\nFixed cash operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and\ncapitalized software, stock-based compensation expense, litigation settlement expenses and variable lease costs such as servicing costs and underwriting fees.\nWe believe fixed cash operating expenses illustrates our controllable ongoing expenses.\n24\nThe reconciliations of operating expenses to fixed cash operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(As Restated) (As Restated)\nOperating expenses $ 16,396 $ 11,909 $ 41,633 $ 40,953\nLess:\nDepreciation and amortization on property and\nequipment and capitalized software 403 247 932 679\nStock-based compensation expense 1,485 1,375 4,428 5,678\nServicing costs 1,160 1,100 3,433 3,193\nUnderwriting fees 490 422 1,490 1,370\nLitigation settlement expenses 3,352 — 3,385 —\nFixed cash operating expenses $ 9,506 $ 8,765 $ 27,965 $ 30,033\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in thousands)\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents generated from leases and borrowings from our RLOC. Our principal liquidity needs for\nthe next 12 months and beyond are to fund normal recurring operational expenses, including purchases of assets held for lease, debt and litigation settlement\nobligations. As of September 30, 2024 cash and cash equivalents totaled $25.9 million, restricted cash totaled $4.4 million, and we had unused capacity on our\nRLOC of $7.7 million.\nOur revenue and operating results depend significantly on gross originations, which is defined as the retail price of the merchandise associated with lease-\npurchase agreements entered into during the period. Gross originations are a leading indicator of potential revenue streams, as a percentage of revenue is\nrealized in the quarter in which the gross originations occur. We continue to realize revenue in subsequent quarters until 100% of the revenue is realized.\nThe Company’s financing is generally comprised of cash from leases and borrowings from the RLOC, which is fully collateralized by our assets. As of\nNovember 1, 2024, we had a combined principal balance outstanding of approximately $98.6 million related to the RLOC and term loan, both of which mature\nwithin twelve months of the date that these financial statements are issued. Both loans were previously refinanced on March 6, 2023 to extend the maturity date\nfrom December 4, 2023 to June 4, 2025.\nWe project we will not have sufficient cash available to pay off the loans upon maturity and are currently seeking to refinance the loans prior to maturity in\nJune 2025. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Under our debt agreements, we are subject to certain covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants in\nthe RLOC and Term Loan as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents cash used in operating, investing, and financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period $ 28,811 $ 69,841\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities (4,070) (7,720)\nInvesting activities (656) (763)\nFinancing activities 6,208 (22,490)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 30,293 $ 38,868\n25\nThe decrease in cash used in operating activities of $3.7 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is primarily the result of a decrease in net\nloss, inclusive of higher non-cash expenses of $10.4 million for depreciation and amortization on property held for sale, $2.1 million related to the net book\nvalue of property held for lease buyouts, partially offset by $7.4 million of additions to property held for lease.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities of $0.1 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized\nsoftware additions.\nThe change in cash provided by financing activities of $28.7 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is primarily due to the $25.0 million\nrepayment on the Term Loan in the 2023 period and an increase in net proceeds from the RLOC of $3.7 million.\nFinancing Arrangements\nSenior Secured Term Loan and RLOC\nOn May 14, 2019, Katapult SPV-1 LLC, as borrower (the “Borrower”), and Katapult Group, Inc. (f/k/a Cognical, Inc.) entered into a Credit Agreement with\nMidtown Madison Management, LLC as agent for various funds of Atalaya Capital Management (“Atalaya”), for a RLOC. The RLOC had a commitment of\n$125 million that the lenders had the right to increase to $250 million. Total outstanding principal under the RLOC was $67.3 million and $60.7 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In December 2023, our third-party loan processor experienced a timing error in their validation\nprocesses. We alerted them to the error, temporarily covering the approved leases with $9.6 million of our cash and the issue was resolved in January 2024.\nExcluding this payment delay, as of December 31, 2023, our outstanding debt under the RLOC would have been $70.4 million, as the RLOC has a 90%\nadvance rate on eligible accounts receivable.\nIn addition, in connection with a prior amendment to the Credit Agreement entered into on December 4, 2020, Atalaya also provided us with a senior secured\nterm loan (the “Term Loan”) commitment of up to $50 million. We drew down the full $50 million of the Term Loan on December 4, 2020. The Term Loan\nbore interest at LIBOR plus 8.0% (with a 1% LIBOR floor) and an additional 3% interest per annum accrued to the principal balance as PIK interest. Total\noutstanding principal and PIK interest under the Term Loan was $31.4 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants including minimum Adjusted EBITDA levels, minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity and\ncompliance with a total advance rate, which were amended in connection with the most recent amendment in March 2023.\nOn March 6, 2023, we entered into the 15th amendment to the Credit Agreement. As part of the amendment, the maturity date of the RLOC and Term Loan\nwas extended from December 4, 2023 to June 4, 2025 and the commitments under the RLOC were reduced to $75 million from $125 million. The spread on\nthe RLOC was increased to 8.5% from 7.5% while the spread on the Term Loan remained at 8%. Additionally, effective April 1, 2023, the benchmark rate for\nRLOC and Term Loan was changed from LIBOR to SOFR, subject in each case to a 3% floor plus applicable credit adjustment spread, which is fixed at\n0.10%. Additionally, the interest rate for PIK interest on the Term Loan is (A) if Liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is greater than $25 million,\n4.5% and (B) if Liquidity is less than $25 million, to 6%.\nAs noted above, the RLOC and Term Loan current maturity date are June 4, 2025. Due to the maturity date being less than one year from the balance sheet date\nof September 30, 2024, we have reclassified our debt to a current liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We are currently seeking to refinance\nthe loans prior to maturity in June 2025.\nIn connection with the 15th Amendment, we repaid $25 million of outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan and issued a warrant to purchase up to\n80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, which vested on September 6, 2023. On December 5, 2023, we issued a warrant to\npurchase an additional 80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share which are vested.\nOn April 24, 2024, we entered into the 16th Amendment in which the Lender granted us a waiver of any Specified Defaults (as defined in the 16th\nAmendment) related to the accounting errors that led to the restatement of our financial statements for all reporting periods prior to the date of the amendment.\nIn addition, the 16th Amendment also updated certain financial covenants each as defined in the 16th Amendment, including Minimum Adjusted EBITDA\n(Trailing 3 Months), Minimum Adjusted EBITDA (YTD) and Minimum Tangible Net Worth. As a result, we were in compliance with all of our covenants as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n26\nThe Credit Agreement is also subject to certain negative and affirmative covenants. The negative covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness;\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; amend our material agreements; make investments; create liens; transfer or sell the collateral under\nthe Credit Agreement; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and enter into certain\ntransactions with affiliates. Early repayments of certain amounts under the Term Loan are subject to prepayment penalties.\nFor additional information on our loan obligations, see Note 6 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nPledge and Guaranty\nPursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 14, 2019, between Katapult Group, Inc. (f/k/a Cognical, Inc.) and Midtown Madison Management, LLC,\nKatapult Group, Inc. pledged and granted a first priority security interest in all equity interests of the Borrower and any investment property and general\nintangibles evidenced by or related to such membership interests. Pursuant to the Corporate Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated as of December 4, 2020,\nby and among Katapult Group, Inc., Legacy Katapult and Midtown Madison Management, LLC, Katapult and Katapult Group, Inc. have granted a first priority\nsecurity interest in all of their respective assets and Katapult and Katapult Group, Inc. guarantee payment of all obligations of the Borrower under the Credit\nAgreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\n(in thousands) Payments Due by Period\nTotal 2024-2025 2026-2027 Thereafter\nRLOC (1) $ 76,034 $ 76,034 $ — $ —\nTerm Loan (2) 34,145 34,145 — —\nOperating lease commitments 1,019 384 219 416\nTotal $ 111,198 $ 110,563 $ 219 $ 416\n(1) Future cash obligations include scheduled interest payments due based on the interest rate of approximately 13.8% as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Future cash obligations include scheduled interest payments due based on the interest rate of 17.8%, including 4.5% PIK interest, as of September 30, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions\nrelating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. We evaluate our significant estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on\nApril 24, 2024, except we no longer consider stock-based compensation a critical accounting policy.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion\nof accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted and their potential impact to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\n27\nEmerging Growth Company\nAs of September 30, 2024, we are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can\ntake advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, allowing them to\ndelay the adoption of those standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period\nunder the JOBS Act. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that are\nrequired to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. We will remain an emerging\ngrowth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have a total annual gross\nrevenue of at least $1.24 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC with at least $700 million of\noutstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous\nthree years.\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (dollars in thousands)\nWe are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of\nfunding sources and other risks. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the\nfair market value of our investments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe market risk inherent in our financial instruments and our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We\nmanage our interest rate risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments, giving consideration to possible effects on\nboth total return and reported earnings. As a result of such assessment, we may enter into swap contracts or other interest rate protection agreements from time\nto time to mitigate this risk.\nEffective April 1, 2023, both the RLOC and the Term Loan replaced LIBOR with SOFR, subject to a 3% floor plus a 0.10% credit adjustment spread. In\nconnection with the 15th amendment to the Credit Agreement, the spread on the RLOC was increased from 7.5% to 8.5% per annum. As of September 30,\n2024, the interest rate on our RLOC was 13.8%.\nOur Term Loan is a variable rate loan that accrues interest at a variable rate of interest based on SOFR, subject to a 3% floor, plus 8% per annum. The spread\nwas unchanged in connection with the 15th amendment to the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on our Term Loan was 17.8%,\nwhich includes 4.5% PIK interest.\nThe effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the fair market value of our investments as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. A 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause our RLOC and Term Loan annual interest expense to\nchange by approximately $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nInflation Risk\nAlthough we believe that inflation has indirectly impacted our business by negatively impacting consumer spending and the sales of our key merchants, we do\nnot believe that inflation has directly had, or currently directly has, a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports\nfiled or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\n28\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses\nin internal control over financial reporting described below.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nControl deficiencies were initially identified in 2020 and in the aggregate constituted material weaknesses. In connection with the audit of our financial\nstatements as of December 31, 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our independent registered public accounting firms noted\ndeficiencies in the design and implementation of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our evaluation was based on COSO Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).\nThese material weaknesses relate to (1) an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to create the\nproper control environment for effective internal control over financial reporting and to ensure that oversight processes and procedures in applying nuanced\nguidance to complex accounting transactions for financial reporting are adequate and (2) a lack of controls in place to review journal entries and account\nreconciliations, reconcile journal entries to evaluate the appropriateness of underlying support and determine if journal entries are in compliance with U.S.\nGAAP before the entries are manually posted. These material weaknesses have not yet been remediated.\nRemediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness\nAs part of our plan to remediate these material weaknesses, we are performing a full review of our internal control procedures. We have implemented, and plan\nto continue to implement, new controls and new processes.\nThe process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in\nour business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to\nsatisfy our reporting obligations. While we are undertaking efforts to remediate these material weaknesses, the material weaknesses will not be considered\nremediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded,\nthrough testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively.\nAs part of continued remediation efforts, the Company hired Nancy Walsh as Chief Financial Officer in December 2022. Ms. Walsh has extensive experience\nin leading the financial organization of publicly traded entities and maintaining an effective internal control environment. In addition, the Company continues\nto strengthen its accounting and internal control capabilities and environment through the hiring of accounting and internal auditing personnel who are certified\npublic accountants and have previous experience in publicly traded companies and with Big 4 public accounting firms. The Company has also hired a Vice\nPresident of Internal Audit and new Chief Accounting Officer, both in 2024. In April 2024, the Company engaged with outside sales tax subject matter experts\nin support of remediation efforts.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time we may become involved with various legal proceedings. Refer to the information contained under the heading “Commitments and\nContingencies” in Note 10 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n29\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our securities. The summarized risks described\nbelow are not the only risks that we face. The following summarized risks as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently\ndeem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, earnings per share, cash flow or the trading\nprice of our common stock. These summarized risks include, among others, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Growth\n• A large percentage of our gross originations is concentrated with a single merchant, and any deterioration in the business of, or in our relationship with\nthis merchant or any other key merchant relationship or partner would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and prospects.\n• If we are unable to attract additional merchant partners and retain and grow our relationships with our existing merchant partners, our results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\n• Unexpected changes to consumer behavior could cause our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving customers to no longer be\nindicative of our customer's ability to perform.\n• Our success depends on the effective implementation and continued execution of our strategies.\n• If we fail to maintain customer satisfaction and trust in our brand our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n• If we are unable to attract new customers and retain and grow our relationships with our existing customers, or if attracting or retaining customers is\nnot cost-efficient, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\n• Our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves\nthe forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\n• The success and growth of our business depends upon our ability to continuously innovate and develop new products and technologies, including\nartificial intelligence and machine learning.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n• We have substantial indebtedness, which may reduce our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions.\n• We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n• The Credit Agreement governing the total aggregate indebtedness under the Term Loan and Credit Facility includes restrictive covenants and financial\nmaintenance covenants, which could restrict our operations or ability to pursue growth strategies or initiatives. Failure to comply with these covenants\ncould result in an acceleration of repayment of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n• A Change of Control as defined by our Credit Agreement could accelerate our obligation to pay our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not have\nsufficient liquid assets at that time to repay these amounts.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\n• We have a history of operating losses and may not be profitable in the future.\n• We rely on card issuers and payment processors. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of Visa, Mastercard or other payment\nprocessors, those payment processors could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Our Platform\n• Real or perceived software errors, failures, bugs, defects, or outages could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\nprospects.\n• Our results depend on continued integration and support of our platforms (both the Katapult App and our direct and/or waterfall integration\ntechnologies) by our merchant partners.\n• We rely on third-party merchants to allow access to their stores through our mobile app.\n• We are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, which\ncould increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability and otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business\nregulations.\n30\n• Any significant disruption in, or errors in, service on our platform or relating to vendors, including events beyond our control, could prevent us from\nprocessing transactions on our platform or posting payments and have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\n• Data security breaches or other security incidents with respect to our information technology systems, networks or data, or those of third parties upon\nwhich we rely, could result in adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations, litigation, fines and penalties, disruption of\nour business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, and loss of customers.\n• Failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\n• We are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our businesses. A failure to\ncorrectly calculate and pay such taxes, or an unfavorable outcome on uncertain tax positions we may record from time to time, may result in\nsubstantial tax liabilities and a material adverse effect on several aspects of our performance.\n• If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results\ncould be adversely affected.\n• We have previously identified control deficiencies that in the aggregate constituted material weaknesses.\n• We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and financial information as of and for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2022, as well as for the interim financial periods, which may adversely impact our business.\n• Delayed filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K has made us currently ineligible to use certain registration statements to register the offer and sale\nof securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\n• We have previously fallen out of compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing, and any future failure to comply with Nasdaq's listing\nrequirements could result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us and\nour stockholders.\n• Changes to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\n• We are subject to legal proceedings from time to time which seek material damages or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\n• Uncertain market and economic conditions have had, and may in the future have, serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition\nand share price.\n• Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n• Misconduct and errors by our employees, vendors, and service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nOther Risks\n• The majority of our management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described\nbelow, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely\naffect our business. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely\naffected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Growth\nA large percentage of our gross originations is concentrated with a single merchant, and any deterioration in the business of, or in our relationship with,\nthis merchant or any other key merchant relationship or partner would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\nWe depend on continued relationships with Wayfair and other key merchants. Our top merchant, Wayfair, represented approximately 42% and 56% of our\ngross originations (which we define as the retail price of the merchandise associated with lease purchase agreements entered into through the Katapult platform\nand do not represent revenue earned) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 46% and 54% of our gross originations\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our top ten merchants in the aggregate represented approximately 80% and\n31\n85% of our gross originations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 82% and 81% of our gross originations during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There can be no guarantee that these relationships will continue or, if they do continue, that\nthese relationships will continue to be successful. There is a risk that we may lose merchants for a variety of reasons, including a failure to meet key contractual\nor commercial requirements, or if merchants shift to in-house solutions (including providing a service competitive to us) or competitor providers.\nThe concentration of a significant portion of our business and transaction volume with a single merchant or a limited number of merchants exposes us\ndisproportionately to events, circumstances, or risks affecting such single merchant, such as Wayfair, or our other key merchants. These risks can include risks\nrelated to the macroeconomic environment, consumer spending changes, inflation, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, pandemics\n(such as COVID-19), consumer confidence in future economic conditions, political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security\nand willingness and ability of consumers to pay for the goods they lease through us when due. For example, supply chain issues have in the past and may in the\nfuture negatively impact the sales of many of our merchants which in turn has contributed, and could in the future contribute, to a decline in our gross\norigination volume during the applicable periods. If our key merchant partners, in particular Wayfair, are unable to acquire new customers or retain existing\ncustomers or are otherwise negatively impacted by the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects\nwill be negatively impacted.\nThe loss of Wayfair as a merchant partner, in particular, would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\nprospects. In addition, a material modification in the merchant agreement with Wayfair or a significant merchant could affect our results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\nWe also depend on continued relationships with key partners that assist in obtaining and maintaining our relationships with merchants. There is a risk that e-\ncommerce platforms with which we partner (such as Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Magneto) may limit or prevent Katapult from being offered\nas a payment option at checkout. We also face the risk that our key partners could become competitors of our business.\nIf our relationship with Wayfair or another key merchant deteriorates, they choose to no longer partner with us, or choose to partner with a competitor, or their\nbusiness is negatively impacted by one or more factors, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially and adversely\naffected.\nIf we are unable to attract additional merchant partners and retain and grow our relationships with our existing merchant partners, our results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur continued success is dependent on our ability to attract new merchant partners and to maintain our relationship with our existing merchant partners and\ngrow our gross originations from those existing merchants through their e-commerce platforms, and also to expand our merchant base. Our ability to attract,\nretain and grow our relationships with merchants depends on the willingness of our merchants to partner with us. The attractiveness of our platform to\nmerchants depends upon, among other things, our brand and reputation, ability to sustain our value proposition to merchants for consumer acquisition, the\nattractiveness to merchants of our digital and data-driven platform, the services, products and consumer decisioning standards offered by our competitors, and\nour ability to perform under, and maintain, our merchant agreements.\nIn addition, competition for smaller merchants has intensified significantly in recent years, with many such merchants simultaneously offering several products\nand services that compete directly with the products and services offered by us. Having a diversified mix of merchants is important to mitigate risk associated\nwith changing consumer spending behavior, economic conditions and other factors that may affect a particular type of retailer. If we fail to retain any of our\nlarger merchants or a substantial number of our smaller merchants, if we do not acquire new merchants, if we do not continually grow our gross originations\nfrom our merchants, or if we are not able to retain a diverse mix of merchants, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially\nand adversely affected.\n32\nThe success of our business is dependent on customers making payments on their leases when due and other factors affecting consumer spending and\ndefault behavior that are not under our control.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through payments on leases we provide to customers to obtain the merchandise of our merchants and we bear the\nrisk of non-payment or late payments by our customers. As such, the success of our business is dependent on customers making payments on their leases when\ndue. We primarily provide leases to non-prime customers who do not have sufficient cash or credit to obtain home furnishings, automotive goods, electronics,\ncomputers, and other durable goods. The ability of these customers to make payments to us when due may be impacted by a variety of factors, such as loss of\nemployment, the emergence of significant unforeseen expenses as well as factors affecting consumer spending. Consumer spending is also affected by general\neconomic conditions and other factors including levels of employment, disposable consumer income, resumption of student loan repayments, inflation,\nprevailing interest rates, regulatory uncertainty, consumer debt and availability of credit, costs of fuel, inflation, recession and fears of recession, banking crisis\nand fears of further banking crisis, war and fears of war (including the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and the conflict involving Israel and Hamas),\npandemics (such as COVID-19), inclement weather, tariff policies, tax rates and rate increases, timing of receipt of tax refunds, consumer confidence in future\neconomic conditions and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Food, energy, residential rent, and other costs have\nincreased, reflecting a tight labor market and supply chain issues. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending for non-prime consumers as\na result of one or more of these factors could reduce demand for our products and services resulting in lower revenue and negatively impacting our business\nand our financial results. In addition to reducing demand for our products, these factors may unfavorably impact our customers' ability or willingness to make\nthe payments they owe us, resulting in increased customer payment delinquencies and lease merchandise write-offs and decreased gross margins, which could\nalso materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf customers are unable or unwilling to pay us due to one or more of these factors, our gross originations may not reflect and/or be directly correlated to our\nrevenue. In addition, if our assumptions around customers’ ability to pay us after we have recognized revenue deteriorate, such deterioration could result in a\nmaterial impairment, increase our cost of revenue and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUnexpected changes to consumer behavior could cause our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving customers to no longer be\nindicative of our customer's ability to perform.\nWe believe our proprietary lease decisioning processes to be a key to the success of our business. The decisioning processes assume behavior and attributes\nobserved for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by our future customers. Unexpected changes in consumer behavior caused by\ngeneral economic conditions and other factors, including continued elevated inflation, continued supply chain disruptions, banking crises, the U.S. economy\nexperiencing a potential prolonged recession and potential widespread job losses may mean that our decisioning tools may not function as intended. As a result,\nwe may approve relatively more customers that are not able to perform, which would lead to increased incidence and costs related to impairment of property\nheld for lease. When there are unexpected changes to consumer behavior, our decisioning process typically requires more frequent adjustments and the\napplication of management analysis of the interpretation and adjustment of the results produced by our decisioning tools. If there is a challenging macro\nenvironment, we may need to make more frequent adjustments to our decisioning process in the near term. If our decisioning tools are unable to accurately\npredict and respond to changes to consumer behaviors as a result of general economic or other factors, our ability to manage risk and avoid charge-offs may be\nnegatively affected, which may result in insufficient reserves and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nOur success depends on the effective implementation and continued execution of our strategies.\nWe are focused on our mission to provide innovative lease financing solutions to non-prime customers and to enable everyday transactions at the merchant\npoint of sale.\nGrowth of our business, including through the launch of new product offerings, requires us to invest in or expand our customer data and technology\ncapabilities, engage and retain experienced management, and otherwise incur additional costs. For example, we launched our mobile app and Katapult Pay in\nthe third quarter of 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our mobile app and Katapult Pay accounted for 31% and 28% of our gross\noriginations, respectively. However, these product enhancements may not continue to generate the additional consumer and merchant engagement with our\nofferings that we expect. If these or other strategic initiatives are not successful longer-term, our competitiveness as well as our business and financial results\nmay be materially and adversely affected. Our inability to address these concerns or otherwise\n33\nto achieve targeted results associated with our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations, or negatively impact our ability to successfully\nexecute future strategies, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nIf we fail to maintain customer satisfaction and trust in our brand, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nWe provide a lease-to-own financing option for qualified customers seeking to obtain durable goods from omnichannel and e-commerce merchants. If\ncustomers do not trust our brand or do not have a positive experience, they will not use our services. Consequently, our ability to attract new customers and\nmerchants is highly dependent on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers and merchants. Any failure to maintain a\nconsistently high level of customer service, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer service, would adversely affect our reputation\nand the number of positive customer referrals that we receive and the number of new and repeat customers. As a result, our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and retain and grow our relationships with our existing customers, or if attracting or retaining customers is not\ncost-efficient, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to generate repeat use and increased gross originations from existing customers and to attract new consumers to\nour platform. Our ability to retain and grow our relationships with our customers depends on the willingness of consumers to use our products and services,\nincluding our mobile app and Katapult Pay. The attractiveness of our Katapult App to customers depends upon, among other things, the number and variety of\nour merchants and the mix of products and services available through our platform, our brand and reputation, customer experience and satisfaction, trust and\nperception of the value we provide, technological innovation, and the services, products and customer decisioning standards offered by our competitors. If we\nfail to retain our relationship with existing customers, if we do not attract new customers to our platform, products and services, or if we do not continually\nexpand usage, repeat customers and gross originations, our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We face competition from a variety of businesses and new market entrants, including competitors with lease-to-\nown products for e-commerce goods and other types of digital payment platforms. We face competition from virtual lease-to-own companies, e-commerce\nretailers (including those that offer layaway programs and title or installment lending), online sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer\nfinance companies that may enable our customers to shop at online retailers, as well as with online rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase\noption. These competitors may have significantly greater financial and operating resources, greater name recognition and more developed products and\nservices, which may allow them to grow faster. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor’s reputation, may help the competitor\ndivert market share. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis (or may have looser decisioning standards or be\nwilling to relax their decisioning standards) in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing strategy or lose business. Moreover,\nprime lenders may loosen their underwriting standards and provide credit to non-prime consumers, which would impact our gross origination as well as the\ncredit quality of our customers and our business and results of operations. In addition, some of our competitors may be willing to lease certain types of products\nthat we will not agree to lease, enter into customer leases that have services, as opposed to goods, as a significant portion of the lease value, or engage in other\npractices related to pricing, compliance, and other areas that we will not, in an effort to gain market share at our expense. Our business relies heavily on\nrelationships with our merchants. An increase in competition could cause our merchants to no longer offer our product and services in favor of our competitors,\nor to offer our product and the products of our competitors simultaneously, which could slow growth in our business and limit or reduce profitability.\nMerchants could also develop their own in house product that competes with our product. Furthermore, virtual lease-to-own competitors may deploy different\nbusiness models, such as direct-to-consumer strategies, that forego reliance on merchant relationships that may prove to be more successful.\nOur business may also be adversely impacted by, among other issues, other consumer finance companies increasing the availability of credit to our target\nconsumer market in response to changes in consumer spending habits as a result of macro or other factors. If more credit is available to our target consumer\nmarket, we will face increased competition, which may negatively impact our gross originations and our business, results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects.\n34\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the\nforecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur market opportunity estimates, including the size of the virtual lease-to-own market, and expectations about market growth are subject to significant\nuncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, including our expectation with respect to the retail environment for\nhome furnishings. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and growth expectations, our business could fail to grow for a variety of\nreasons, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy of third-party data, and inaccuracies in such data could adversely impact our approval process.\nWe use data from third parties as part of our proprietary risk model used to assess whether a customer qualifies for a lease-purchase option from a merchant.\nWe are reliant on these third parties to ensure that the data they provide is accurate. Inaccurate data could cause us to not approve transactions that otherwise\nwould have been approved, or instead, approve transactions that would have otherwise been denied and may lead to a higher incidence of bad debts and could\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success and growth of our business depends upon our ability to continuously innovate and develop new products and technologies, including artificial\nintelligence and machine learning.\nOur solution is a technology-driven platform that relies on innovation to remain competitive. The process of developing new technologies and products is\ncomplex, and we build our own technology using the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning (\"AI/ML\"), cloud-based technologies, and other tools\nto differentiate our products and technologies. See “—We utilize AI/ML, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business” in “Risks Related\nto Our Technology and Our Platform” for more information. In addition, our dedication to incorporating technological advancements into our platform requires\nsignificant financial and personnel resources and talent. Our development efforts with respect to these initiatives could distract management from current\noperations and could divert capital and other resources from other growth initiatives important to our business. In addition, the product and technological\nenhancements that we introduce may not function as we intend, or may not generate the benefits that we expect. We operate in an industry experiencing rapid\ntechnological change and frequent product introductions. We may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as demanded by our customers\nand merchants, which could harm our ability to attract customers and merchants. In addition, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-\ndriven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to customers and merchants. If we are unable\nto successfully and timely innovate and continue to deliver a superior merchant and customer experience, the demand for our products and technologies may\ndecrease and our growth, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to accurately predict the demand or growth of our new products and technologies also could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects. New products and technologies are inherently risky, due to, among other things, risks associated with:\nthe product or technology not working, or not working as expected; customer and merchant acceptance; technological outages or failures; and the failure to\nmeet customer and merchant expectations. As a result of these risks, we could experience increased claims, reputational damage, or other adverse effects,\nwhich could be material. The profile of potential customers using our new products and technologies also may not be as attractive as the profile of the\ncustomers that we currently serve, which may lead to higher levels of delinquencies or defaults than we have historically experienced. Additionally, we can\nprovide no assurance that we will be able to develop, commercially market, and achieve acceptance of our new products and technologies. In addition, our\ninvestment of resources to develop new products and technologies and make changes or updates to our platform may be insufficient. Failure to accurately\npredict\n35\ndemand or growth with respect to our new products and technologies could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\nTo the extent that we seek to grow through future acquisitions, or other strategic investments or alliances, we may not be able to do so effectively.\nWe may in the future seek to grow our business by exploring potential acquisitions or other strategic investments or alliances. We may not be successful in\nidentifying businesses or opportunities that meet our acquisition or expansion criteria. In addition, even if a potential acquisition target or other strategic\ninvestment is identified, we may not be successful in completing such acquisition or integrating such new business or other investment. We may face\nsignificant competition for acquisition and other strategic investment opportunities from other well-capitalized companies, many of which have greater\nfinancial resources and greater access to debt and equity capital to secure and complete acquisitions or other strategic investments, than we do. As a result of\nsuch competition, we may be unable to acquire certain assets or businesses, or take advantage of other strategic investment opportunities that we deem\nattractive; the purchase price for a given strategic opportunity may be significantly elevated; or certain other terms or circumstances may be substantially more\nonerous.\nAny delay or failure on our part to identify, negotiate, finance on favorable terms, consummate, and integrate any such acquisition or other strategic investment\nopportunity could impede our growth. Additional risks relating to potential acquisitions include difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies,\nproducts and personnel of the acquired businesses, diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of\nmanaging larger and more widespread operations, the potential loss of key employees, vendors and other business partners of the businesses we acquire; and\nincreased amounts of debt incurred in connection with such activities or dilutive issuances of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses. Furthermore, we may be responsible for any legacy liabilities of businesses we\nacquire or be subject to additional liability in connection with other strategic investments. The existence or amount of these liabilities may not be known at the\ntime of acquisition, or other strategic investment, and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may reduce our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, the total aggregate indebtedness under the senior secured Term Loan and RLOC, of\nKatapult SPV-1 LLC (the “Borrower”) was approximately $98.7 million of principal outstanding with Midtown Madison Management LLC, as agent for\nvarious funds of Atalaya Capital Management (the \"Lender\"). On March 6, 2023, in connection with the 15th amendment of our Credit Agreement, we\nrefinanced our indebtedness with the Lender and repaid $25.0 million of principal on our outstanding term loan. We, together with our wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Katapult Group, Inc., have guaranteed the obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement. Our payments on our outstanding indebtedness\nare significant in relation to our revenue and cash flow, which exposes us to significant risk in the event of downturns in our business (whether through\ncompetitive pressures or otherwise), our industry or the economy generally, since our cash flows would decrease but our required payments under our\nindebtedness would not. Economic downturns may impact our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our Credit Agreement and to make\npayments on our indebtedness as they become due.\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our Credit Agreement could also:\n• make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations;\n• limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n• limit our ability to service our indebtedness;\n• limit our ability to adapt to changing market conditions;\n• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n36\n• require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to paying the principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby limiting\nthe availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other corporate purposes;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry generally; and\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have a less significant debt burden.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement, secured by a pledge over all of the assets of the Borrower is guaranteed by us and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Katapult\nGroup, Inc., which in turn is secured by a pledge over all of our assets and the assets of Katapult Group, Inc.\nWe may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness\nwould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur indebtedness matures on June 4, 2025. We are currently negotiating the refinancing of our indebtedness which may include extending the maturity date of\nthe RLOC and Term Loan. Our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our\noperating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business,\nlegislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of\nrefinancing could increase our interest expense. A refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more\nonerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon\nattractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe Credit Agreement governing the Term Loan and Credit Facility includes restrictive covenants and financial maintenance covenants, which could\nrestrict our operations or ability to pursue growth strategies or initiatives. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an acceleration of\nrepayment of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants that restrict some of our activities.\nThe negative covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; amend our material\nagreements; make investments; create liens; transfer or sell the collateral for the Credit Agreement; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge, sell or\notherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Non-scheduled repayments of certain amounts under\nthe Credit Agreement are subject to prepayment penalties, which would limit our ability to pay or refinance the Credit Agreement. Our ability to meet these\ncovenants could be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to satisfy them which would prevent us from pursuing certain growth\nstrategies or initiatives due to this limitation. These or other limitations could decrease our operating flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating\nobjectives. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants. In particular, as of the end of each month, (1) we must maintain certain minimum\nAdjusted EBITDA levels and certain minimum Tangible Net Worth representing our total assets less certain capital expenses, prepaid expenses, intangible\nassets and total liabilities and (2) our Total Advance Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) may not exceed certain thresholds. We must also maintain\nminimum liquidity of at least $10.0 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of any date of determination. These financial covenants are restrictive\nand failure to comply with these covenants would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have been in\nthe past and may in the future be unable to comply with our financial covenants. In such event, if we are unable to negotiate with our Lender for a waiver or\ndispensation under the agreement, we would not be able to borrow under the Credit Agreement and our Lender would have the right to terminate the loan\ncommitments under the Credit Agreement and accelerate repayment of all obligations under the Credit Agreement that would become due and payable\nimmediately, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets\nto repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the Lender has the right to foreclose their liens against all of our assets and take possession and sell\nany such assets to reduce any such obligations.\n37\nA Change of Control as defined by our Credit Agreement could accelerate our obligation to pay our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not have\nsufficient liquid assets at that time to repay these amounts.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, all of the outstanding loans are required to be prepaid in full (together with accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment premium)\nand the revolving line of credit (\"RLOC\") will terminate if a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs that is not approved by the Lender.\nA Change of Control includes the occurrence of the following: (i) any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, but excluding any employee benefit plan of such person or its subsidiaries, and any person or entity acting in its capacity as trustee,\nagent or other fiduciary or administrator of any such plan) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, except that a person or group shall be deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of all securities that such person or group has the right to acquire\n(such right, an “option right”), whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of 35% or more of the\nequity securities of Katapult Holdings, Inc. entitled to vote for members of the board of directors (on a fully-diluted basis (and taking into account all such\nsecurities that such person or group has the right to acquire pursuant to any option right), and (ii) certain changes in the composition of our board of directors\noccurs during a twenty-four month period which were not recommended or approved by at least a majority of directors who were directors at the beginning of\nsuch twenty-four month period.\nIn connection with the 15th amendment of our Credit Agreement, we repaid $25.0 million of principal on our outstanding Term Loan. As of September 30,\n2024, we had $67.3 million of principal outstanding under the RLOC. In addition, we had borrowings under our Term Loan of $31.4 million (including\ncapitalized PIK interest) as of September 30, 2024.\nIf any specified Change of Control occurs and the Lender accelerates these obligations, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to repay amounts outstanding\nunder the Credit Agreement.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be profitable in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss of $8.9 million and $16.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In addition, we generated a\nnet loss of $4.1 million and $22.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our\naccumulated deficit was approximately $138.9 million. While our operating expenses decreased for the year ended December 2023 compared to the prior year,\nwe may need to increase our operating expenses in the future in order to continue growing our business, attracting customers, merchants and funding sources,\nand further enhancing and developing our products and platforms. As we expand our offerings to additional markets, our offerings in these markets may be less\nprofitable than the markets in which we currently operate. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may incur net losses in the future and may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual\nbasis.\nOur ability to timely raise capital in the future may be limited, or may be unavailable on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Debt or equity issued to raise additional capital may\nreduce the value of our common stock. We cannot be certain when or if the operations of our business will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing\noperations or the growth of our business. We intend to make investments to support and grow our business and may require additional funds to respond to\nbusiness challenges, including the need to develop or enhance our technology, expand our sales and marketing efforts or develop new products. Additional\nfinancing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future\ngrowth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders could have rights\nsenior to holders of our common stock and/or existing debt to make claims on our assets. The terms of any additional debt could have covenants which restrict\nour operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, or make capital\nexpenditures. If we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of\nour common stock including liquidation or other preferences. Because the decision to issue securities in the future offering will depend on numerous\nconsiderations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity\nsecurities. As a result, stockholders will bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of their common stock and diluting their\ninterest.\n38\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business.\nOur revenue and operating results have varied, and may in the future vary, from quarter to quarter and by season. Periods of decline have resulted, and could in\nthe future result, in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness and grow our business. We expect\nour quarterly results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including general economic conditions in the markets where we operate, the cyclical\nnature of consumer spending, the impact of holiday and seasonal sales and tax refund and customer spending patterns.\nAny significant disruption or errors relating to our loan providers and loan processor, could delay the processing of transactions on our platform or cause\ntemporary fluctuations in cash use and have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nPursuant to our Credit Agreement, we are required to use a designated loan processor to validate customer purchases for funding our RLOC and, thus, in the\noperation of our platform. The performance and accuracy of said loan processor is essential to our operations and is critical to ensuring that loans are\nappropriately and timely funded. We rely on the designated loan processor to ensure their systems, internal procedures, verification processes and facilities are\nprotected against service interruptions, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, and similar events. We may be harmed if there is a delay,\ndisruption, or error in loan validation. Further, if our arrangements with the designated loan processor is terminated, or if there is a lapse in service due to\nerrors, we could experience interruptions in the provision of our leases. We may also experience increased costs and difficulties in funding leases or finding\nreplacement loan providers or processors on commercially reasonable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn addition, in the event of error or interruption, we may be required to use cash to cover for any losses or uncovered leases that might occur, albeit temporarily.\nThis could reduce our available cash or cause reputational harm, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nIn December 2023, the processor for our loan provider experienced a timing error in their validation processes. We alerted them to the error, temporarily\ncovering the approved leases with our cash and the issue was resolved in January 2024. Both our loan provider and processor have since instituted changes to\ncorrect against similar interruptions in service, but there can be no assurance that a similar error will not occur in the future.\nWe rely on card issuers and payment processors. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of Visa, Mastercard or other payment processors,\nthose payment processors could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe rely on card issuers and payment processors and must pay a fee for this service. From time to time, payment processors such as Visa or Mastercard may\nincrease the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. The payment processors routinely update and modify their\nrequirements. Changes in the requirements, including changes to risk management and collateral requirements, may impact our ongoing cost of doing business\nand we may not, in every circumstance, be able to pass through such costs to our merchants or associated participants. Furthermore, if we do not comply with\nthe payment processors’ requirements (e.g., their rules, bylaws, and charter documentation), the payment processors could seek to fine us, suspend us or\nterminate our registrations that allow us to process transactions on their networks. The termination of our registration due to failure to comply with the\napplicable requirements of our payment processors, or any changes in the payment processors’ rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop\nutilizing payment services from our payment processors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition,\nand prospects.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change\", generally defined as a\ngreater than 50.0% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited or potentially significantly\ndeferred compared to such ability in the absence of an “ownership change”. The completion of the Business Combination may have triggered an “ownership\nchange” limitation. We have not completed a formal study to determine if any “ownership changes” within the meaning of IRC Section 382 have occurred. If\n“ownership changes” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code have occurred, and if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other tax credits generated since inception to offset\n39\nU.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could require us to pay U.S.\nfederal income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Our Platform\nWe utilize AI/ML, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business.\nWe use AI/ML in many aspects of our business. In particular, we use AI/ML to create models which provide data to assist in key aspects of our business,\nincluding fraud analysis, credit risk analysis, and product personalization. There are significant risks involved in utilizing AI/ML and no assurance can be\nprovided that our use of such AI/ML will enhance our products or services or produce the intended results. The AI/ML models that we use are trained using\nvarious data sets. If the AI/ML models are incorrectly designed, the data we use to train them is incomplete, inadequate, or biased in some way, or we do not\nhave sufficient rights to use the data on which our AI/ML models rely, the performance of our products, services, and business, as well as our reputation, could\nsuffer or we could incur liability through the violation of laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy, or other rights, or contracts to which\nwe are a party. AI/ML can present ethical issues and may subject us to new or heightened legal, regulatory, ethical, or other challenges; and inappropriate or\ncontroversial data practices by developers and end-users, or other factors adversely affecting public opinion of AI/ML, could impair the acceptance of AI/ML\nsolutions, including those incorporated in our products and services. If the AI/ML tools that we use are deficient, inaccurate or controversial, we could incur\noperational inefficiencies, competitive harm, legal liability, brand or reputational harm, or other adverse impacts on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, regulation of AI/ML is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies.\nThe technologies underlying AI/ML and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, data privacy and security,\nconsumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of\nexisting laws and regulations. AI/ML is the subject of ongoing review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various U.S. states and other\nforeign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, cybersecurity, and data protection laws and regulations to AI/ML or\nare considering general legal frameworks for AI/ML. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need\nto expend resources to adjust our operations or offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore,\nbecause AI/ML technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that\nmay arise relating to the use of AI/ML.\nReal or perceived software errors, failures, bugs, defects, or outages could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\nprospects.\nOur platform and our internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and our internal systems depend on the\nability of such software to store, retrieve, manage and otherwise process immense amounts of data, including personal data. As a result, undetected errors,\nfailures, bugs, or defects may be present in such software or occur in the future in such software, including open source software and other software we license\nin from third parties, especially when updates or new products or services are released.\nAny real or perceived errors, failures, bugs, defects, or outages in such software may not be found until our customers use our platform and could result in\noutages or degraded quality of service on our platform that could adversely impact our business (including through causing us not to meet contractually\nrequired service levels), as well as negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, and harm to our brand or weakening\nof our competitive position. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, to expend significant additional resources in order to correct the problem.\nAny real or perceived errors, failures, bugs, defects, or outages in the software we rely on could also subject us to liability claims, result in data security\nbreaches or other security incidents, impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, or expand their use of our products and services,\nwhich would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur results depend on continued integration and support of our platforms (both the Katapult App and our direct and/or waterfall integration technologies)\nby our merchant partners.\nWe depend on our merchant partners, which generally accept most major credit cards and other forms of payment, to present our platform as a payment option\nand to integrate our platform into their website or in their store, such as by featuring our\n40\nplatform on their websites or in their stores and at checkout. We do not have any recourse against merchant partners when they do not feature our platform as a\npayment option. The failure by our merchants to effectively present, integrate, and support our platform, or to effectively explain lease-to-own transactions to\npotential customers, would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party merchants to allow access to their stores through our mobile app.\nWe depend on third-party merchants to continue to allow our customers to utilize our platform and mobile app to access and buy goods at their stores. We do\nnot have contractual relationships with our third-party merchants, and as such there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offer access to any\nparticular third-party merchant to our customers. The loss of our ability to offer our customers access to third-party merchants would have a material and\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, which could\nincrease the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability and otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business regulations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, share and\notherwise process a wide variety of data and information, including personal data and sensitive personal data, proprietary and confidential business data, trade\nsecrets, and intellectual property. For example, we process the personal data, including sensitive personal data, of customers, including Social Security\nnumbers. We are subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations that\ngovern the processing of personal data by us or by third parties on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, regulations and rules including data breach\nnotification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) imposes specific\nrequirements relating to marketing to individuals using technology such as telephones, mobile devices, and text messages. TCPA violations can result in\nsignificant financial penalties, including penalties or criminal fines imposed by the Federal Communications Commission or fines of up to $1,500 per violation\nimposed through private litigation or by state authorities. Class action suits are the most common method for private enforcement. We are also subject to the\nrules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\nincluding with respect to data privacy and security. Moreover, the United States Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various\nproposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation, to which we may be subject if passed.\nData privacy and security are also areas of increasing state legislative focus and we are, or may in the future become, subject to various state laws and\nregulations regarding data privacy and security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) broadly defines personal information, gives\nCalifornia residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches. The CCPA is indicative of a trend towards greater state-level regulation of data privacy and security in the U.S. A number of other states have\nenacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws that share similarities with the CCPA. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally\nrequire businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to customers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. For\nadditional information on data privacy and security laws, regulations and rules we are, or may in the future become, subject to, see the section titled “Business\n—Government Regulation.”\nIn addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose, data privacy and security standards with which we are legally or\ncontractually bound to comply. For example, we may also be subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), which requires\ncompanies that process payment card data to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining\nfirewalls, adopting proper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. Noncompliance with PCI-DSS can result in\nsignificant penalties or liability, litigation, loss of access to major payment card systems, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses. We may also rely on\nvendors to process payment card data, and those vendors may be subject to PCI DSS, and our business may be negatively affected if our vendors are fined or\nsuffer other consequences as a result of PCI DSS noncompliance.\n41\nWe also make public statements about our use and disclosure of personal data through our privacy policies, information on our website and press statements.\nAlthough we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The\npublication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential\ngovernment or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our data privacy and\nsecurity practices, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nIncreasingly, some aspects of our business may be reliant on our ability to have our products and services be accepted by or compatible with a third-party\nplatform, and any inability to do so could negatively impact our business. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our products. Any of\nthese developments could impair our ability to reach new or existing customers or otherwise negatively affect our operations. In addition, the CCPA grants\nCalifornia residents the right to opt-out of a business's sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising purposes.\nOur obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective\nfuture legal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict\namong jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires significant resources and may necessitate changes to our information\ntechnologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may require us to\nchange our business model. Our business model materially depends on our ability to process personal data, so we are particularly exposed to the risks\nassociated with the rapidly changing legal landscape. For example, we may be at heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny, and any changes in the regulatory\nframework could require us to fundamentally change our business model.\nAlthough we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards, and contractual obligations, we may at times\nfail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such\nobligations, which could negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party service provider to\ncomply with applicable laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations could result in adverse effects, including inability to or interruption in our\nability to operate our business and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply\nwith data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government\nenforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class claims; damages); additional reporting\nrequirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers;\ninterruptions or stoppages in our business operations; interruptions or stoppages of data collection needed to train our algorithms; inability to process personal\ndata or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or\ninquiry; adverse publicity; or revision or restructuring of our operations.\n42\nAny significant disruption in, or errors in, service on our platform or relating to vendors, including events beyond our control, could prevent us from\nprocessing transactions on our platform or posting payments and have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, and prospects.\nWe use vendors, such as our cloud computing web services provider, virtual card processing companies, and third-party software providers, in the operation of\nour platform. The satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our technology and our underlying network and infrastructure are critical to our\noperations and reputation and the ability of our platform to attract new and retain existing merchants and customers. We rely on these vendors to protect their\nsystems, networks and facilities against damage or service interruptions from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues,\nenvironmental conditions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other attempts to harm these systems, data security breaches or other security incidents, criminal\nacts, and similar events. If our arrangement with a vendor is terminated or if there is a lapse of service or damage to its systems, networks or facilities, we could\nexperience interruptions in our ability to operate our platform. We also may experience increased costs and difficulties in replacing that vendor and replacement\nservices may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. Any interruptions or delays in our platform availability, whether as\na result of a failure to perform on the part of a vendor, any damage to one of our vendor’s systems, networks or facilities, the termination of any of our third-\nparty vendor agreements, software bugs or failures, our or our vendor’s error, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, or data security breaches\nor other security incidents, whether accidental or willful, or other factors, could harm our relationships with our merchants and customers and also harm our\nreputation.\nIn addition, we source certain information from third parties. For example, our risk scoring model is based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors and\ncurrently depend on sourcing certain information from third parties. In the event that any third-party from which we source information experiences a service\ndisruption, whether as a result of maintenance, software bugs or failures, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, or data security breaches or\nother security incidents whether accidental or willful, or other factors, the ability to score and decision lease-to-own applications through our platform may be\nadversely impacted. Additionally, there may be errors contained in the information provided by third parties. This may result in the inability to approve\notherwise qualified applicants through our platform, which may adversely impact our business by negatively impacting our reputation and reducing our\ntransaction volume.\nTo the extent we use or are dependent on any particular third-party data, technology, or software, we may also be harmed if such data, technology, or software\nbecomes non-compliant with existing laws, regulations, rules or standards, becomes subject to third-party claims of intellectual property infringement,\nmisappropriation, or other violation, or malfunctions or functions in a way we did not anticipate. Any loss of the right to use any of this data, technology, or\nsoftware could result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until equivalent or replacement data, technology, or software is either developed\nby us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, and there is no guarantee that we would be successful in developing, identifying, obtaining, or\nintegrating equivalent or similar data, technology, or software, which could result in the loss or limiting of our products, services, or features available in our\nproducts or services.\nIn addition, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster\nrecovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an\noutage. These factors could prevent us from processing transactions or posting payments on our platform, damage our brand and reputation, divert the attention\nof our employees, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause customers or merchants to abandon our platform, any of which could have a material\nand adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n43\nData security breaches or other security incidents with respect to our information technology systems, networks or data, or those of third parties upon\nwhich we rely, could result in adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties,\ndisruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, and loss of customers.\nCyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. These threats are becoming increasingly\ndifficult to detect. These threats come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or\nmisuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks,\nincluding without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war\nand other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including cyber-attacks, that\ncould materially disrupt our systems, networks and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services. The automated\nnature of our business and our reliance on digital technologies may make us an attractive target for, and potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We and the\nthird parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to: computer malware (including as a result of\nadvanced persistent threat intrusions), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), social engineering (including phishing attacks), ransomware attacks, denial-\nof-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware\nfailures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunication failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats.\nRansomware attacks, including by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and\nsevere and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may\nalleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or\nregulations prohibiting such payments. Similarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties and\ninfrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs\nthat could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems and networks (including our products or services) or the third-party\ninformation technology systems and networks that support us and our services. We are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of companies\nworldwide and, as a result, if our products are compromised, a significant number of companies could be simultaneously affected. The potential liability and\nassociated consequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event could be catastrophic and result in irreparable harm.\nCybersecurity risks may be heightened as a result of ongoing military conflicts such as military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions\nimposed by the United States and other countries or the ongoing Israel/Hamas conflict. Furthermore, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions\nor integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems and networks could be negatively affected by\nvulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems, networks and technologies.\nAny of the above identified or similar threats could cause a data security breach or other security incident. A data security breach or other security incident\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure, transfer, use or other\nprocessing of, or access to our, our customers’, our vendors’ or our merchants’ confidential, proprietary, personal or other information. A data security breach or\nother security incident could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our platform, products, or services. We may expend\nsignificant resources in connection with investigating, mitigating or remediating, or modifying our business activities to protect against, actual or perceived\ndata security breaches or other security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security\nmeasures, as well as maintain industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and networks which contain\nconfidential, proprietary, personal and other information.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against data security breaches and other security incidents, there can be no assurance that\nthese measures will be effective. We may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems and networks (including our\nproducts or services) because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, may not be detected until after a security incident\nhas occurred, and may see their frequency increased and effectiveness enhanced, by the use of AI/ML. Despite our efforts to identify and remediate\nvulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems and networks(including our products or services), our efforts may not be successful. Further, we\nmay experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\n44\nWe may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary, personal and other\ninformation in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, virtual card processing, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email, and other functions. We may share or receive confidential, proprietary, personal or other information with or from\nthird parties. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information\nsecurity measures in place. Due to applicable laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for data security\nbreaches or other security incidents attributed to our third-party service providers as they relate to the information we share with them.\nAny actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us, including those relating to data privacy and security, or any\nfailure to protect the information that we collect from our customers and merchants, including personal information, from cyber-attacks, data security breaches\nor other security incidents, or any such actual or perceived failure by our originating bank partners, may result in, among other things, revocation of required\nlicenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions,\ncivil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.\nApplicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of data\nsecurity breaches and other security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to\nadverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience, or are perceived to have experienced, a data security breach or other security\nincident, or fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators or law enforcement agencies following any such event, we may experience\nadverse consequences. These consequences may include: interruptions to our operations (including availability of data), violation of applicable data privacy\nand security laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations; litigation (including class claims), damages, an obligation to notify regulators and\naffected individuals, the triggering of indemnification and other contractual obligations, government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines,\npenalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing personal and other sensitive data; negative\npublicity; reputational damage; loss of customers and ecosystem partners; monetary fund diversions; financial loss; and other similar harms. Additionally, our\noriginating bank partners also operate in a highly regulated environment, and many laws and regulations that apply directly to our originating bank partners are\nindirectly applicable to us through our arrangements with our originating bank partners. Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where\nthey do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data\nprivacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising\nout of our data privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage\nwill pay future claims.\nWhile we take precautions to prevent customer identity fraud, it is possible that identity fraud may still occur or has occurred, which may adversely affect\nthe performance of the lease-to-own transactions facilitated through our platform.\nThere is risk of fraudulent activity associated with our platform, customers, and third parties handling customer information. Our resources, technologies, and\nfraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. We bear the risk of loss for lease-to-own transactions facilitated through our\nplatform. The level of fraud related charge-offs on the lease-to-own transactions facilitated through our platform could be adversely affected if fraudulent\nactivity were to significantly increase.\nWe bear the risk of customer fraud in a transaction involving us, a customer, and a merchant, and we generally have no recourse to the merchant to collect the\namount owed by the customer. Significant amounts of fraudulent cancellations or chargebacks and the potential cost of remediation could adversely affect our\nbusiness or financial condition. High profile fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negative\npublicity, and the erosion of trust from our customers and merchants, and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition, prospects, and cash flows.\n45\nFailure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nOur business depends on intellectual property and proprietary technology and information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We\nrely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-\ndisclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary\ntechnology, software, know-how, and brand.\nAlthough we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or\neffective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, reverse engineering, infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property\nand proprietary technology and information, including by third parties who may use our intellectual property or proprietary technology or information to\ndevelop services that compete with ours. We may not be able to register or enforce all of our trademarks and any of our trademarks or other intellectual\nproperty rights may be challenged by others.\nIn addition, we are and may in the future be subject to claims by third parties that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual\nproperty. For example, on September 30, 2024, FlexShopper filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas\nMarshall Division. The complaint alleges infringement of certain patents referenced in the complaint, and seeks, among other relief, injunctive relief and\nmonetary damages (including attorneys’ fees) and we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings. If FlexShopper prevails in this\nongoing litigation, we could be enjoined or be ordered to pay significant damages, either of which would have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we ultimately prevail in the FlexShopper litigation or other such litigation, this type of litigation is time-consuming and costly to defend, resulting in\nthe diversion of significant operational resources and changes to our business model. Our involvement in intellectual property disputes and any failure to\nadequately protect our intellectual property rights may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. In addition, during the course of\nthis kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities\nanalysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nFurther, we license certain technology, software, data and other intellectual property from third parties that are important to our business. Our business may\nsuffer if any current or future licenses or other grants of rights to us terminate, if the licensors (or other applicable counterparties) fail to abide by the terms of\nthe license or other applicable agreement, if the licensors fail to enforce the licensed intellectual property against infringing third parties or if the licensed\nintellectual property rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, which can require significant compliance costs and\nexpose us to government investigations, significant additional costs, fines or other monetary penalties or settlements, and compliance-related burdens.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and an increased risk of regulatory actions as a result of the highly regulated\nnature of our industry and the focus of state and federal enforcement agencies on the lease-to-own industry in particular. Any adverse change in applicable laws\nor regulations, the passage of unfavorable new laws or regulations, or the manner in which any applicable laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced\ncould dictate changes to our business practices that may be materially adverse to the Company. Further, our transactions are subject to various federal and state\nlaws and regulations which may result in significant compliance costs as well as expose us to litigation. In particular, our rental-purchase transactions and the\ncustomer-facing operations related thereto, such as collections and marketing, are subject to various other federal, state and/or local consumer protection laws.\nThese laws, as well as the rental-purchase statutes under which we operate, provide various remedies in connection with violations, including restitution and\nother monetary penalties and sanctions which in certain circumstances can be significant.\nWe cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any new laws or regulations will be enacted, or whether government agencies will initiate new or\ndifferent interpretations of existing laws. The impact of new laws and regulations, or modifications by regulators concerning the interpretation or enforcement\nof existing laws, on our business is not known; however, any such changes could materially and adversely impact our business.\n46\nThe laws and regulations applicable to our operations are subject to agency, administrative and/or judicial interpretation. Some of these laws and regulations\nhave been enacted only recently and/or may not yet have been interpreted or may be interpreted infrequently. As a result of non-existent or sparse\ninterpretations, ambiguities in these laws and regulations may create uncertainty with respect to the requirements of any applicable laws and regulations. Any\nambiguity under a law or regulation to which we are subject may lead to regulatory investigations, governmental enforcement actions and private causes of\naction, such as class action lawsuits, with respect to our compliance with such laws or regulations.\nFederal and state agencies have increased their focus on consumer financial products and services. State law enforcement agencies and regulators appear to\nhave increased their scrutiny of entities operating within the personal property rental-purchase, or “lease-to-own”, industry. For example, in July 2023, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a case in federal district court in Utah again Snap Finance alleging, in summary, that certain rent-to-own\ntransactions were credit transactions falling under federal law. Further, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (“DFPI”) has issued\nsubpoenas and is conducting investigations into practices of entities operating within the personal property rental-purchase industry. Similarly, state attorneys\ngeneral also appear to have increased their scrutiny of the industry. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not received investigatory demands from\nCalifornia DFPI or state attorneys general. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be included in future actions of the same or similar\nnature and, if it is, that it would not lead to an enforcement action, consent order, or substantial costs, including legal fees, fines, penalties, and remediation\nexpenses.\nFor information on data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations we are, or may in the future become, subject to, and\nthe associated risks to our business, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology and Our Platform—We are subject to stringent and\nchanging laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, which could increase the cost of doing business,\ncompliance risks and potential liability and otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business.”\nWe are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our businesses. A failure to correctly\ncalculate and pay such taxes, or an unfavorable outcome on uncertain tax positions we may record from time to time, may result in substantial tax\nliabilities and a material adverse effect on several aspects of our performance.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, continues to be a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the lease-to-own industry\ngenerally and our virtual lease-to-own business more specifically. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established\nbefore the growth of the lease-to-own industry and e-commerce and, therefore, in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business. In\naddition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to\nincrease tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. This also may result in other adverse changes in or interpretations of existing sales, income and other\ntax regulations. Further, we may fail to allocate sales tax correctly which could result in over-reporting or under-reporting revenue and sales tax expense.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. As a public reporting company subject to the rules and\nregulations established from time to time by the SEC and Nasdaq, we are required to, among other things, establish and periodically evaluate procedures with\nrespect to our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify, on an annual basis, that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective. As such, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control\nsystems.\nA control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs. Furthermore, compliance\nwith existing requirements is expensive and we may need to implement additional finance and accounting and other systems, procedures and controls to satisfy\nour reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose\n47\nconfidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties,\nand adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe have previously identified control deficiencies that in the aggregate constituted material weaknesses. We may identify additional material weaknesses in\nthe future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate\nany material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and\nprocedures our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nControl deficiencies were initially identified in 2020 and in the aggregate constituted material weaknesses. In connection with the audit of our financial\nstatements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our independent registered public accounting firm noted these control deficiencies in the\ndesign and implementation of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis. Our evaluation was based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework (2013).\nAdditional control issues were discovered during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. We\ndetermined that our revenue and sales tax payable were materially misstated in certain prior periods. Our conclusion was based on the Company’s\ndetermination that it miscalculated its sales tax payable related to certain customer lease payments going back multiple years. The Company performed an\nassessment of its sales tax liabilities across all jurisdictions for potential additional exposure and determined there was an overstatement of rental revenue and\nan understatement of sales tax payable included in accrued liabilities. As a result of the foregoing conclusion, we determined that our previously issued\nfinancial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the relevant quarterly periods and filings\ndiscussed below in the risk factor “We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and financial information\nas of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as well as for the interim financial periods for 2022 and 2023, which may adversely impact our\nbusiness” should no longer be relied upon and have been restated.\nThese control deficiencies relate to (1) an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience to create the proper\ncontrol environment for effective internal control over financial reporting and to ensure that oversight processes and procedures in applying nuanced guidance\nto complex accounting transactions for financial reporting are adequate, and (2) a lack of controls in place to review journal entries and account reconciliations,\nreconcile journal entries to underlying support and evaluate if journal entries are in compliance with GAAP before the entries are manually posted. These\nmaterial weaknesses were not remediated as of September 30, 2024 and have not been remediated as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAs part of our plan to remediate these material weaknesses, we are performing a full review of our internal control procedures. We have implemented, and plan\nto continue to implement, new controls and new processes. We cannot assure you that the measures that we have taken, and that will be taken, to remediate\nthese material weaknesses will, in fact, remedy the material weaknesses or will be sufficient to prevent future material weaknesses from occurring. We also\ncannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material weaknesses.\nIn addition to the deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that were initially identified in 2020, subsequent testing by us or our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, which has not performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, may reveal additional deficiencies in our\ninternal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline\nimposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to remediate our existing material weakness\nor identify additional material weaknesses and are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control\nover financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness\nof our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock\nexchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nTo comply with Section 404, we are investing in compliance-related resources. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely\nmanner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify\n48\ndeficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the\nSEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls\nand procedures or internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, and cause a decline in the price of\nour common stock.\nWe face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and financial information as of and for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022, as well as for the interim financial periods for 2022 and 2023, which may adversely impact our business.\nAs described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024, during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, we determined that due to the adjustment required to rental revenue and sales tax payable included in accrued liabilities, our\npreviously issued financial statements described below were materially misstated.\nAs a result of the above, we determined that our previously issued financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods\nwithin that year, as well as the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods\nwithin the year ended December 31, 2023 should no longer be relied upon and have been restated.\nAs a result of the restatement, we are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our\nfinancial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We may discover additional errors and our financial statements remain subject to the\nrisk of future restatement. We are also at risk of potential litigation or other disputes which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state\nsecurities laws, or other claims arising from the restatement. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any such disputes arising out of the\nrestatement.\nWe cannot ensure that all of the risks described above will be eliminated or that general reputational harm will not be caused due to the restatement. If one or\nmore of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nDelayed filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K has made us currently ineligible to use certain registration statements to register the offer and sale of\nsecurities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nBecause we were unable to file our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 with the SEC on a timely basis, we will not be eligible to register the\noffer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for\none year. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, we would be required to\nfile a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer than filing a\nregistration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially\nharming our financial condition.\nFurthermore, under SEC regulations, our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC resulted in the suspension of the availability of our Form S-8\nfor issuances of shares underlying equity awards subject to these plans. With the filing of our Form 10-K on April 24, 2024, we regained compliance and our\nability to use Form S-8. Although we are currently in compliance, we could fail to comply with these requirements again in the future, in which case we would\nlose our ability to use Form S-8 and our employees would not be permitted to exercise any outstanding options for unrestricted shares of our common stock and\nwe would be unable to grant other equity awards under our Form S-8 until such time that we are deemed to have filed all reports and other materials required to\nbe filed under the Exchange Act following any such future failure to timely file.\n49\nWe have previously fallen out of compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing, and any future failure to comply with Nasdaq's listing\nrequirements could result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our\nstockholders.\nOn April 21, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the\nclosing bid price for our common stock was below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing bid price required for continued listing. In accordance with\nNasdaq rules, we had 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until October 18, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price\nrequirement. In order to regain compliance, our common stock had to trade above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On July 27,\n2023, we effected a 1-for-25 Reverse Stock Split of our common stock with the intention of increasing the per share market price of our common stock to meet\nthe minimum per share price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq and we were in compliance with the minimum closing bid requirements as of August\n10, 2023. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with Nasdaq's minimum per share price requirement or other continued listing\nstandards in the future.\nOn April 18, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq indicating that, as a result of not filing our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in\na timely manner, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. The deficiency letter\nindicated that we had until June 17, 2024 to regain compliance or submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards. With the filing\nof our Form 10-K on April 24, 2024, we regained compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards and have eliminated the need to submit such a\ncompliance plan. Although we are currently in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, we could fail to comply with these requirements\nagain in the future. In that case, we would receive additional deficiency letters from Nasdaq and our common stock could be delisted from trading on the\nNasdaq Global Market, which could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect the price of our common stock. In the\nevent our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our securities, including our common\nstock, and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our securities when you wish to do so. In addition, in the event of a delisting, we can provide no\nassurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow any of our securities to become listed again, stabilize the\nmarket price or improve the liquidity of our securities or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our\nsecurities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n• a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n• reduced liquidity for our securities;\n• a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules\nand possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain\nsecurities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Since our common stock and public warrants are listed on the Nasdaq, they are covered securities.\nAlthough the states are preempted from regulating the sale of its securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a\nsuspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. If we are\nno longer listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and it would be subject to regulation in each state in which it offers its securities,\nincluding in connection with the initial business combination.\nChanges to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nContinued developments in U.S. tax reform and changes to tax laws and rates in other jurisdictions where we do business could adversely affect our results of\noperations and cash flows. It is also possible that provisions of U.S. tax reform could be subsequently amended in a way that is adverse to us.\n50\nIn addition, we may undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our income tax provisions and accruals are\nreasonable and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all\napplicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits and any related litigation, could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals. The results of a tax audit or litigation could materially affect our operating results and cash flows in the periods for which that\ndetermination is made. In addition, future period net income may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and interest assessments.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time that may seek material damages or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time that may seek material damages or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. See “Commitments and Contingencies” in Note 10 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. The costs we incur in defending ourselves or associated with settling any of these proceedings, as well\nas a material final judgment or decree against us, could materially adversely affect our financial condition by requiring the payment of the settlement amount, a\njudgment or the posting of a bond and/or such matters could otherwise materially and adversely impact our business, including resulting in additional dilution\nif we are obligated to issue shares to settle all or a portion of such legal proceedings.\nIn addition, others in our industry have defended class action lawsuits alleging various regulatory violations and have paid material amounts to settle such\nclaims. If we are named in any such class action lawsuits or other legal proceedings, significant settlement amounts or final judgments could materially and\nadversely affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nTo attempt to limit costly and lengthy customer, employee and other litigation, including class actions, we require our customers and employees to sign\narbitration agreements, including class action waivers. In addition to opt-out provisions contained in such agreements, recent judicial and regulatory actions\nhave attempted to restrict or eliminate the enforceability of such agreements and waivers. If we are not permitted to use arbitration agreements and/or class\naction waivers, or if the enforceability of such agreements and waivers is restricted or eliminated, we could incur increased costs to resolve legal actions\nbrought by customers, employees and others, as we would be forced to participate in more expensive and lengthy dispute resolution processes.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\nUncertain market and economic conditions have had, and may in the future have, serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and\nshare price.\nThe global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and\ncredit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest\nrates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, in March 2023 a global banking crisis led to significant volatility in the capital markets. Similarly,\nthe ongoing military conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine have had, and are expected to continue to have, global economic\nconsequences. Any such volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets\ndeteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on\nfavorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefit\ncosts. In addition, higher inflation could also adversely affect discretionary spending for non-prime customers, which could reduce demand for our products\nand services. Any significant increases in inflation and related increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n51\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or\nincrease our operating margins. The competitive environment in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient\noperations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our overall cost of operations, labor\nand benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, data costs, payment processing costs, cost of capital, or indirect spending could\nmaterially adversely affect our profitability.\nNegative publicity about us or our industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nNegative publicity about us or our industry, including the transparency, fairness, user experience, quality, and reliability of our platform or lease-to-own\nplatforms in general, effectiveness of our risk model, our ability to effectively manage and resolve complaints, our data privacy and security practices,\nlitigation, regulatory activity, misconduct by our employees, funding sources, service providers, or others in our industry, the experience of customers and\ninvestors with our platform or services or lease-to-own platforms in general, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in, and\nthe use of, our platform, which could harm our reputation and cause disruptions to our platform. For instance, in October 2020, a data breach broker purported\nto offer customer records from a number of companies, including us, for sale on a hacker forum. Although we determined with third party firms and our\ninternal team that the compromised data did not include confidential proprietary or personal data, we cannot guarantee that this publicity or any similar\npublicity in the future will not have a negative effect on our business or reputation. Any such reputational harm could further affect the behavior of customers,\nincluding their willingness to utilize lease-to-own programs through our platform or to make payments on their leases. As a result, our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees, vendors, and service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees, vendors, and other service providers. Our\nbusiness depends on our employees, vendors, and service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, including transactions that\ninvolve significant dollar amounts and lease-to-own transactions that involve the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and business\ninformation. We could be adversely affected if transactions were redirected, misappropriated, or otherwise improperly executed, personal and business\ninformation was disclosed to unintended recipients, or an operational breakdown or failure in the processing of other transactions occurred, whether as a result\nof human error, a purposeful sabotage or a fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. In addition, the manner in which we store and use certain\npersonal data and interact with customers and merchants through our platform is governed by various federal and state laws. If any of our employees, vendors,\nor service providers take, convert, or misuse funds, documents, or data, or fail to follow protocol when interacting with customers and merchants, we could be\nliable for damages and subject to regulatory actions and penalties. We could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation\nof funds, documents, or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. For example, our operations are subject to\ncertain laws generally prohibiting companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or\nretaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Violations by our employees, contractors\nor agents of policies and procedures we have implemented to ensure compliance with these laws could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S.\nand in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could cause us to\nincur significant legal fees, and could damage our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct or errors by employees, vendors, or\nservice providers, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses.\nAny of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers and merchants, inability to attract future\ncustomers and merchants, reputational damage, regulatory intervention, and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nThe loss of the services of any of our leadership team could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\nprospects.\nThe experience of our leadership team are valuable assets to us. Our leadership team has significant experience in the financial technology industry and would\nbe difficult to replace. Competition for senior executives in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or\nsucceed any of our leaders. Failure to retain or recruit\n52\nleadership team members could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization, in\nparticular, a highly experienced sales force, data scientists, and engineers. Competition for these types of highly skilled employees, is extremely intense.\nTrained and experienced personnel are in high demand and may be in short supply. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees\nhave greater resources than we do and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training\nour employees, which increases their value to competitors that may seek to recruit them. We may not be able to attract, develop, and maintain the skilled\nworkforce necessary to operate our business, and labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of qualified personnel. If we are unable to\nmaintain and build our highly experienced sales force, or are unable to continue to attract experienced engineering and technology personnel, as well as other\nqualified employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditional Risks Relating to Ownership of Company Securities\nThe ultimate effect of the Reverse Stock Split on the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nThe ultimate effect of the Reverse Stock Split on the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and we cannot assure you that\nthe Reverse Stock Split will result in any or all of the expected benefits for any meaningful period of time, or at all. While the Reverse Stock Split had the\neffect of increasing the market price of our common stock, we cannot assure you that it will result in permanent or sustained increase in the market price of our\ncommon stock. Further, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, our “float” or the number of shares that are available to the public for purchase has been\nsubstantially reduced which, in itself, may cause more volatility or limit the ability of potential investors from owning our stock. The market price of our\ncommon stock depends on multiple factors, many of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding, including our business and financial\nperformance, general market conditions and prospects for future success, any of which could have a counteracting effect to the Reverse Stock Split on the per\nshare price.\nThe price of our securities may change significantly in the future and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock and public warrants is likely to be volatile and the trading price of our securities have experienced extreme volatility\nand a significant decline. The securities markets have experienced significant volatility as macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation and the ongoing\ngeopolitical conflicts including those between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. Market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political\nconditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. Our operating results have been below and\ncould continue to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including:\n• results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n• results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n• factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control;\n• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts\nand investors;\n• declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n• strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n• any significant change in our management;\n• changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n• changes in business or regulatory conditions, including new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our\nbusiness;\n53\n• future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n• investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n• the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n• litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n• guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n• the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n• actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, geopolitical conflict (including the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and\nthe Israel-Hamas conflict), pandemics (including COVID-19), acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In\naddition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock or public warrants is low.\nThe majority of our management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly\ncomplex laws pertaining to public companies could be a disadvantage in that it is possible that an increasing amount of our management’s time may be devoted\nto these activities which will result in less time being devoted to our management and growth. The development and implementation of the standards and\ncontrols necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the U.S. may require costs greater than expected. It is\npossible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company which may\nincrease our operating costs in future periods.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time for\nnew compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses\nmay increase after we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations\nimpose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these\ncompliance initiatives. The increased costs will impact our financial position. These rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us\nto obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits, higher retention levels, or incur substantially higher costs\nto maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these\nrequirements.\nBecause there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment\nunless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the\nforeseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of\ndirectors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash\nand current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us\nto our stockholders or by its subsidiaries to it and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is\nlimited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by\n54\ncovenants of any future indebtedness that we incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our\ncommon stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume\ncould decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We\nwill not control these analysts. In addition, some financial analysts may have limited expertise with our model and operations. Furthermore, if one or more of\nthe analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our\nbusiness, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on it regularly, we could lose\nvisibility in the market, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or potential future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of\nour common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that it deems appropriate.\nThe lock-up agreement contained in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “A&R RRA”) with us expired and the shares of common\nstock held by the stockholders party to the A&R RRA are eligible for resale which could result in the market price of shares of our common stock dropping\nsignificantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for\nus to raise additional funds through future offerings of our common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are\nissued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, lock-up agreements and, in some cases, limitations on volume and manner of sale\napplicable to affiliates under Rule 144, as applicable. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock initially reserved for future issuance under our\n2021 equity incentive plan was 235,287. On June 6, 2023, the 2021 equity incentive plan was amended to increase the authorized shares of common stock\nreserved for issuance by 160,000. As of September 30, 2024, there were 113,263 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2021 equity\nincentive plan.\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of common stock issued in connection with an\ninvestment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in\nconnection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWarrants are exercisable for our common stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in\ndilution to our existing stockholders.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 673,300 shares of our common stock. The warrant agreement, dated as of\nOctober 31, 2019, between the Company and FinServ Acquisition Corp. entitles each warrant holder thereof to purchase one (1) share of our common stock at\na price of $287.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of common stock. In addition, on\nMarch 6, 2023, in connection with the 15th amendment of our Credit Agreement, we issued a warrant to purchase up to 80,000 shares of our common stock at\nan exercise price of $0.25 per share, which vested on September 6, 2023. On December 5, 2023, we issued a warrant to purchase an additional 80,000 shares of\nour common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share which vested on March 6, 2024. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our\ncommon stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for\nresale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n55\nThe JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to\nother public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012, which we refer to as the “JOBS Act.” As such, we will take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the\nauditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from\nsay-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in\nits periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an\nemerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2024, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which\nwe are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the\nlast business day of our prior second quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-\nyear period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or\nrevised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth\ncompany can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act\nprovides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies,\nbut any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or\nrevised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the\ntime private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is\nneither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible\nbecause of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock\nless attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Charter and Amended and Restated Bylaws have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a\nmerger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those\nattempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n• advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n• certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n• limiting the ability of stockholders to act by written consent; and\n• our board of directors have the express authority to make, alter or repeal our Amended and Restated Bylaws.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many\nof our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. These provisions could also discourage\nproxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you\ndesire.\n56\nOur Amended and Restated Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions\nand proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with\nus or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, any (1) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (2) action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder or employee to us or our stockholders, (3) action asserting a claim\narising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Amended and Restated Charter or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (4) action asserting a claim\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nor, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our\nAmended and Restated Charter described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for disputes with us or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and\nemployees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Amended and Restated Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or\nmore of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could\nadversely affect our business and financial condition.\nITEM 2.

(“Katapult” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:\nKPLT), an e-commerce-focused \u0000nancial technology company, today reported its \u0000nancial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024.\n“We are continuing to grow across key \u0000nancial and operating metrics including gross originations and revenue,\nand we believe we are laying the foundation for the long-term success of Katapult,” said Orlando Zayas, CEO of\nKatapult. “As we have grown the business, we’ve also meaningfully diversi\u0000ed our gross originations base. In fact, in\nless than four years, we have increased gross originations that exclude Wayfair from under 30% to 58% of our base,\nand this part of our business grew 37% year-over-year during the third quarter. Katapult Pay(R) (“KPay”) continues\nto be a big driver of our growth with KPay gross originations increasing 86% year-over-year and representing 31% of\ntotal gross originations during the quarter. As we head into the holiday season, we intend to leverage the power of\nour waterfall and direct merchant relationships, KPay and targeted marketing to give our customers more reasons\nto shop with us and merchants more reasons to partner with us. We are excited for a strong \u0000nish to the year.”\nOperating Progress: Recent Highlights\nLeveraged our new waterfall relationship with PayTomorrow, a premier waterfall \u0000nancing platform, to\nintegrate our lease-to-own (LTO) o\u0000ering in the checkout process with new merchants, including:\n1\nTire Agent, an online tire and wheels company that serves customers across the continental US\nBB Wheels, a tires, wheels and accessories business with customers throughout the continental US\nExtreme Customs, a tire, wheels and accessories company that has a nationwide customer base.\nExtreme Customs already has a direct integration with Katapult, which this waterfall application process\nwill complement.\nWe currently have 24 total merchants live on the PayTomorrow platform\nContinued to build momentum for KPay and our app\nKPay gross originations grew 86% year-over-year\nLaunched Blue Nile and Tire Rack in the KPay marketplace, bringing the total number of merchants on\nthe platform to 30\nLaunched a pilot of product-based search that upgrades our search functionality. Instead of performing\ncategory or merchant level searches, consumers can now search for speci\u0000c, potentially lower-priced\nproducts available in our merchants’ inventory.\nCustomer satisfaction remained high and Katapult had a Net Promoter Score of 61 as of September 30, 2024.\n60.3% of gross originations for the third quarter of 2024 came from repeat customers1.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we signed a non-binding letter of intent with a direct lender with respect to a new\nrevolving line of credit, working capital line of credit and term loan (the “Potential Credit Facility”). If we\nconsummate the Potential Credit Facility, the new revolving line of credit and term loan would re\u0000nance and\nreplace our outstanding credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will consummate this Potential\nCredit Facility or any other credit facility with this or any other lender.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n(All comparisons are year-over-year unless stated otherwise.)\nGross originations were $51.2 million, an increase of 3.3%\nTotal revenue was $60.3 million, an increase of 10.0%\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter increased 37.7%. Excluding litigation settlement expenses, total\noperating expenses increased 9.5%. Our \u0000xed cash operating expenses2, which exclude litigation settlement\nexpenses, increased approximately 8.5%.\nNet loss was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net loss of $4.1 million reported for the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted net loss2 was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.1\nmillion reported for the third quarter of 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA2 was $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA2 of $0.9 million\nin the third quarter of 2023\n2\nKatapult ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $30.3 million, which includes $4.4 million\nof restricted cash. The Company ended the quarter with $67.3 million of outstanding debt on its credit facility.\nWrite-o\u0000s as a percentage of revenue were 9.5% in the third quarter of 2024 and are within the Company’s\n8% to 10% long-term target range. This compares with 9.5% in the third quarter of 2023.\n[1] Repeat customer rate is de\u0000ned as the percentage of in-quarter originations from existing customers.\n[2] Please refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure and Certain Other Data” section and the GAAP to non-\nGAAP reconciliation tables below for more information.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Business Outlook\nThe Company is continuing to navigate a challenging macro environment particularly within the home furnishings\ncategory. Given the breadth of our merchant selection, our strategic marketing and our strong consumer o\u0000ering,\nwe believe we are well positioned heading into the holiday season. We continue to believe that we have a large\naddressable market of underserved, non-prime consumers, and it’s important to note that lease-to-own solutions\nhave historically bene\u0000ted when prime credit options become less available.\nBased on these dynamics and the operating plan in place for the full year 2024, Katapult expects to deliver the\nfollowing results for the fourth quarter of 2024:\n6 to 8% year-over-year increase in gross originations\n5 to 7% year-over-year increase in revenue\nBreakeven Adjusted EBITDA\nFor full year 2024, Katapult expects the following:\nWe expect to continue to expand our customer base and acquire new customers\nWe expect gross originations to grow 2 to 4%.\nThis outlook does not include any material impact from prime creditors tightening or loosening above us and\nassumes that there are no signi\u0000cant changes to the macro environment.\nBoth our fourth quarter and full year outlooks assume that the home furnishings category does not improve\nmaterially from our third quarter performance.\nWe also expect to maintain strong credit quality in our portfolio. This will be driven by ongoing enhancements\nto our risk modeling, onboarding high quality new merchants through integrations, and repeat customers\nengaging with Katapult Pay\n3\nRevenue growth is expected to be at least 10%\nFinally with the continued execution of our disciplined expense management strategy combined with our\ngrowing top-line, we expect to deliver approximately $5.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.\n\"We continue to execute our growth strategy and are focused on in\u0000uencing the drivers that are within our control,”\nsaid Nancy Walsh, CFO of Katapult. “Our third quarter outlook assumed that our home furnishings category would\nreturn to its normal performance, but unfortunately we faced continued headwinds in the quarter. We o\u0000set this\ndynamic by taking action that supported strong performance in our business excluding Wayfair, which grew nearly\n40% year-over-year. In addition we are maintaining an e\u0000cient expense structure, which, we believe, when coupled\nwith our continued top-line growth, positions Katapult to deliver our \u0000rst full-year of Adjusted EBITDA pro\u0000tability\nsince 2021. We are grateful for our team’s hard work and are looking forward to giving our customers and\nmerchants alike a great holiday season.”\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 8:00 AM ET on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, to discuss\nthe Company’s \u0000nancial results. Related presentation materials will be available before the call on the Company’s\nInvestor Relations page at https://ir.katapultholdings.com. The conference call will be broadcast live in listen-only\nmode and an archive of the webcast will be available for one year.\nAbout Katapult\nKatapult is a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omnichannel retailers and e-commerce\nplatforms to power the purchasing of everyday durable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers. Through\nour point-of-sale (POS) integrations and innovative mobile app featuring Katapult Pay(R), consumers who may be\nunable to access traditional \u0000nancing can shop a growing network of merchant partners. Our process is simple,\nfast, and transparent. We believe that seeing the good in people is good for business, humanizing the way\nunderserved consumers get the things they need with payment solutions based on fairness and dignity.\nContact\nJennifer Kull\nVP of Investor Relations\nir@katapult.com\nForward-Looking Statements\n4\nCertain statements included in this Press Release and on our quarterly earnings call that are not historical facts are\nforward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements are based\non various assumptions, whether or not identi\u0000ed in this Press Release, and on the current expectations of\nKatapult’s management and are not predictions of actual performance.\nThese forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, a\nguarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a de\u0000nitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and\ncircumstances are di\u0000cult or impossible to predict and will di\u0000er from assumptions. Many actual events and\ncircumstances are beyond the control of Katapult. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of\nrisks and uncertainties, including Katapult’s ability to re\u0000nance its indebtedness, the execution of Katapult’s\nbusiness strategy, launching new product o\u0000erings and new brands and expanding information and technology\ncapabilities; Katapult’s market opportunity and its ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers;\nadoption and success of our mobile application featuring Katapult Pay; the timing and impact of our growth\ninitiatives on our future \u0000nancial performance and the impact of our new executive hires and brand strategy;\nanticipated occurrence and timing of prime lending tightening and impact on our results of operations; general\neconomic conditions in the markets where Katapult operates, the cyclical nature of customer spending, and\nseasonal sales and spending patterns of customers; risks relating to factors a\u0000ecting consumer spending that are\nnot under Katapult’s control, including, among others, levels of employment, disposable consumer income,\nin\u0000ation, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, pandemics (such as COVID-19),\nconsumer con\u0000dence in future economic conditions, political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal\nwell-being and security and willingness and ability of customers to pay for the goods they lease through Katapult\nwhen due; risks relating to uncertainty of Katapult’s estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market\ngrowth; risks related to the concentration of a signi\u0000cant portion of our transaction volume with a single merchant\npartner, or type of merchant or industry; the e\u0000ects of competition on Katapult’s future business; meet future\n5\nliquidity requirements and complying with restrictive covenants related to our long-term indebtedness; the impact\nof unstable market and economic conditions such as rising in\u0000ation and interest rates; reliability of Katapult’s\nplatform and e\u0000ectiveness of its risk model; data security breaches or other information technology incidents or\ndisruptions, including cyber-attacks, and the protection of con\u0000dential, proprietary, personal and other\ninformation, including personal data of customers; ability to attract and retain employees, executive o\u0000cers or\ndirectors; e\u0000ectively respond to general economic and business conditions; obtain additional capital, including\nequity or debt \u0000nancing and servicing our indebtedness; enhance future operating and \u0000nancial results; anticipate\nrapid technological changes, including generative arti\u0000cial intelligence and other new technologies; comply with\nlaws and regulations applicable to Katapult’s business, including laws and regulations related to rental purchase\ntransactions; stay abreast of modi\u0000ed or new laws and regulations applying to Katapult’s business, including with\nrespect to rental purchase transactions and privacy regulations; maintain and grow relationships with merchants\nand partners; respond to uncertainties associated with product and service developments and market acceptance;\nthe impacts of new U.S. federal income tax laws; that Katapult has identi\u0000ed material weaknesses in its internal\ncontrol over \u0000nancial reporting which, if not remediated, could a\u0000ect the reliability of its condensed consolidated\n\u0000nancial statements; successfully defend litigation; litigation, regulatory matters, complaints, adverse publicity\nand/or misconduct by employees, vendors and/or service providers; and other events or factors, including those\nresulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions (including the con\u0000ict involving Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-\nHamas con\u0000ict), terrorism, public health crises and pandemics (such as COVID-19), or responses to such events;\nKatapult’s ability to meet the minimum requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market; the e\u0000ects\nof the reverse stock split on our common stock; and those factors discussed in greater detail in the section entitled\n“Risk Factors” in Katapult’s periodic reports \u0000led with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that Katapult \u0000led with the SEC.\nIf any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could di\u0000er materially from the\nresults implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Katapult does not presently\nknow or that Katapult currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to di\u0000er from those\ncontained in the forward-looking statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking\nstatements in this Press Release. All forward-looking statements contained herein are based on information\navailable to Katapult as of the date hereof, and Katapult does not assume any obligation to update these\nstatements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law.\nKey Performance Metrics\nKatapult regularly reviews several metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate its business, measure its\nperformance, identify trends a\u0000ecting our business, formulate \u0000nancial projections and make strategic decisions,\nwhich may also be useful to an investor: gross originations, total revenue, gross pro\u0000t, adjusted gross pro\u0000t and\n6\nadjusted EBITDA.\nGross originations are de\u0000ned as the retail price of the merchandise associated with lease-purchase agreements\nentered into during the period through the Katapult platform. Gross originations do not represent revenue earned.\nHowever, we believe this is a useful operating metric for both Katapult’s management and investors to use in\nassessing the volume of transactions that take place on Katapult’s platform.\nTotal revenue represents the summation of rental revenue and other revenue. Katapult measures this metric to\nassess the total view of pay through performance of its customers. Management believes looking at these\ncomponents is useful to an investor as it helps to understand the total payment performance of customers.\nGross pro\u0000t represents total revenue less cost of revenue, and is a measure presented in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below\nfor a description and presentation of adjusted gross pro\u0000t and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures\nutilized by management.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the \u0000nancial measures presented in this press release and related conference call or webcast in\naccordance with GAAP, the Company also presents the following non-GAAP and other measures of \u0000nancial\nperformance: adjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and \u0000xed cash operating\nexpenses. The Company believes that for management and investors to more e\u0000ectively compare core\nperformance from period to period, the non-GAAP measures should exclude items that are not indicative of our\nresults from ongoing business operations.The Company urges investors to consider non-GAAP measures only in\nconjunction with its GAAP \u0000nancials and to review the reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures\nto its comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures, which are included in this press release.\nAdjusted gross pro\u0000t represents gross pro\u0000t less variable operating expenses, which are servicing costs, and\nunderwriting fees. Management believes that adjusted gross pro\u0000t provides a meaningful understanding of one\naspect of its performance speci\u0000cally attributable to total revenue and the variable costs associated with total\nrevenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as net loss before interest expense and other fees, interest\nincome, change in fair value of warrants and loss on issuance of shares, provision for income taxes, depreciation\nand amortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, provision of impairment of leased assets,\nloss on partial extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\n7\nAdjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as net loss before change in fair value of warrants and loss\non issuance of shares, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation settlement expenses.\nFixed cash operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure that is de\u0000ned as operating expenses less depreciation and\namortization on property and equipment and capitalized software, stock-based compensation expense, litigation\nsettlement expenses and variable lease costs such as servicing costs and underwriting fees. Management believes\nthat \u0000xed cash operating expenses provides a meaningful understanding of non-variable ongoing expenses.\nAdjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are useful to an investor in evaluating the Company’s\nperformance because these measures:\nAre widely used to measure a company’s operating performance;\nAre \u0000nancial measurements that are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate the\nCompany’s credit worthiness; and\nAre used by the Company’s management for various purposes, including as measures of performance and as\na basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nManagement believes the use of non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to\ninvestors in that they eliminate items that are not part of our core operations, highly variable or do not require a\ncash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures\nwhen evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Management believes\nthat these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in\ncomparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and \u0000nancial analysts in assessing\noperating performance. However, these non-GAAP measures exclude items that are signi\u0000cant in understanding\nand assessing Katapult’s \u0000nancial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as\nalternatives to revenue, net loss, gross pro\u0000t, cash \u0000ows from operations or other measures of pro\u0000tability, liquidity\nor performance under GAAP. You should be aware that Katapult’s presentation of these measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nKATAPULT HOLDINGS, INC.
