Immediately prior to effecting the Split-Off, Liberty Media’s subsidiary Quint would be reattributed from the Formula One Group to the Liberty Live Group in exchange for certain private assets. Any cash consideration would be determined at a future date based on relative valuations at the time of the reattribution. \n\n“The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities. Following the split-off, Liberty Media will be an independent, asset-backed company holding our motorsport businesses and related sports investments,” said Greg Maffei, Liberty Media President and CEO. “Since acquiring Quint in January 2024, we have bolstered its partnership with Formula 1 and gained insights into our fans and ticket demand trends, but Quint is also complementary to our interest in Live Nation, especially as Live Nation works to grow its hospitality operations. Quint can continue to enhance its partnership with F1 and MotoGP in this new ownership structure while having the opportunity to expand its offering to additional partners.” \n\nLiberty Media will effect the Split-Off through the redemption of Liberty Media’s Liberty Live common stock in exchange for common stock of a newly formed company to be called Liberty Live, Inc. Liberty Media would redeem each outstanding share of its Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Live common stock for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of Liberty Live, Inc. As a result of the Split-Off, Liberty Media and Liberty Live, Inc. would be separate publicly traded companies, and Liberty Media would no longer have a tracking stock structure. \n\nLiberty Live, Inc. will hold approximately 69.6 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV)1 (“Live Nation”), Quint, certain private assets currently attributed to Liberty Live Group, corporate cash and debt obligations attributed to the Liberty Live Group, together with other assets as may be determined by Liberty Media prior to the Split-Off. \n\nLiberty Media will hold its subsidiaries Formula 1 and MotoGP (upon closing the acquisition), certain private assets currently attributed to Formula One Group, corporate cash and debt obligations attributed to the Formula One Group, together with other assets as may be determined by Liberty Media prior to the Split-Off. \n\nLiberty Media is expected to continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Liberty Live, Inc. common stock is expected to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or, if necessary, to be quoted on the OTC Markets. Additional information will be available at a later date. \n\nThe Split-Off is subject to various conditions including, among other things, certain requisite approvals of holders of Series A and Series B Liberty Live common stock and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel. The Split-Off is intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty Media. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions, Liberty Media expects to complete the Split-Off in the second half of 2025. \n\nLiberty Media’s President and CEO, Greg Maffei, will discuss this announcement at its previously scheduled annual Investor Meeting on Thursday, November 14, 2024 with presentations beginning at approximately 9:30 am E.T. \n\nThe Investor Meeting will be held in New York, NY and is open to shareholders, research analysts and press. Registration and livestream information is available on the Liberty Media website at <https://www.libertymedia.com/investor-day>. An archive of the webcast of the Investor Meeting and accompanying slides will also be available on <https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar> after appropriate filings have been made with the SEC. \n\n____________________________ 1 Shares of Live Nation held by Liberty Media Corporation as of September 30, 2024. \n\nAbout Liberty Media Corporation\n\nLiberty Media Corporation operates and owns interests in a broad range of media, communications, sports and entertainment businesses.

Liberty Media’s Chairman, John Malone, will assume the role of interim CEO and will work closely with the Liberty Media executive team and the Board of Directors to ensure a seamless transition. Maffei will step down at the expiration of his contract at year-end and will serve as a Senior Advisor effective January 1st to support the management transition.\n\n“On behalf of the Liberty Media board, I’d like to thank Greg for his leadership, creativity and dedication,” said Mr. Malone. “Since joining in 2005, Greg has been at the forefront of the exciting evolution in the lifecycle of Liberty. He has grown our asset base and made the company better and more valuable for shareholders, along the way overseeing as many as five separate public companies simultaneously. Especially following today’s transaction announcements, our company is simpler and more focused than ever before, which is a perfect capstone for Greg’s accomplished career at Liberty. I wish Greg continued success as he embarks on his next chapter and appreciate his continued support as an Advisor.”\n\n“The almost 20 years I have spent at the helm of Liberty Media have been incredibly rewarding, stimulating and endlessly eventful. Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside. The corporate structure is optimized, and the portfolio companies are in strong positions with talented executive teams in place. While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time,” said Mr. Maffei. “I have thoroughly enjoyed working alongside and learning from John, our board, the management teams at Liberty and across the family of companies and our shareholders.”\n\nMr. Malone continued, “Looking ahead, I am acutely focused on rationalizing the structural discounts at Liberty Media and growing our attractive, cash generative businesses. We have built a fantastic company with high-quality assets in media, communications, sports and entertainment. I look forward to working with our executive team to uncover new opportunities for shareholder value creation.”\n\nUnder Maffei’s leadership, Liberty Media has grown its leading media, communications, sports and entertainment assets. Through creative deal making, Liberty completed the acquisition and investment in preeminent businesses including the Atlanta Braves, DirecTV, SiriusXM, Live Nation Entertainment, Charter Communications and Formula 1. Over the past 19 years during Maffei’s tenure, Liberty Media’s composite value has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 17% compared to 11% for the S&P 500, representing an 18x absolute return1. While CEO, Maffei has served as the Chairman of SiriusXM, Live Nation Entertainment, Liberty TripAdvisor, Tripadvisor, Starz, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Qurate Retail, and has served as a director of Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Charter Communications, DirecTV and Barnes & Noble.

It is great to see the on-track talent of both our seasoned drivers as well as young talent who hopefully have long F1 careers ahead.” \n\nThe following table provides the operating results of Formula 1 (“F1”). \n\n3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change   \n---|---|---  \namounts in millions   \nPrimary Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  790  |  $  |  758  |  (4  |  )%   \nOther Formula 1 revenue  |  97  |  103  |  6  |  %   \nTotal Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  887  |  $  |  861  |  (3  |  )%   \nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation):   \nTeam payments  |  (432  |  )  |  (371  |  )  |  14  |  %   \nOther cost of Formula 1 revenue  |  (183  |  )  |  (190  |  )  |  (4  |  )%   \nCost of Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  (615  |  )  |  $  |  (561  |  )  |  9  |  %   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  (57  |  )  |  (79  |  )  |  (39  |  )%   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  215  |  $  |  221  |  3  |  %   \nStock-based compensation  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  %   \nDepreciation and Amortization(a) |  (82  |  )  |  (74  |  )  |  10  |  %   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  132  |  $  |  146  |  11  |  %   \nNumber of races in period  |  8  |  7   \n_________________________   \n---  \na)  |  Includes $74 million and $61 million of amortization related to purchase accounting for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively, that is excluded from calculations for purposes of team payments.   \n  \nPrimary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1’s revenue and is derived from (i) race promotion revenue, (ii) media rights fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. \n\nThere were seven races held in the third quarter of 2024, compared to eight races held in the third quarter of 2023. There are 24 events scheduled for the 2024 race calendar, compared to 22 events held in 2023. \n\nPrimary F1 revenue decreased in the third quarter due to less media rights and sponsorship revenue driven by one fewer race held in the current period which resulted in a lower proportion of season-based revenue recognized. Sponsorship revenue also decreased due to the impact of the mix of races on event specific fees, partially offset by recognition of revenue from new sponsors. The decline in media rights revenue recognized was partially offset by contractual increases in fees and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Race promotion revenue grew in the third quarter due to fees from the different mix of events held compared to the prior year period. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher licensing revenue and revenue generated from third-party events at the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, partially offset by lower hospitality income due to the mix of events in the current period. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA(2) increased in the third quarter. Team payments decreased due to the pro rata recognition of payments across the race season with one fewer race held in the current period, partially offset by the expectation of higher team payments for the full year. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with servicing Primary F1 revenue streams and higher digital costs, partially offset by lower FIA regulatory, technical, hospitality and travel costs due to the mix of events held. Other cost of F1 revenue in the third quarter was also impacted by higher costs associated with F1 Academy and lease expense for the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza which wasn’t incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased due to higher personnel, IT, property and marketing costs as well as legal and other professional fees, partially offset by foreign exchange favorability. \n\nCorporate and Other Operating Results\n\nCorporate and Other revenue increased in the second quarter due to the inclusion of Quint results and $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. In the third quarter, Quint results were primarily driven by F1 Experiences across the seven races held. Quint’s revenue is seasonal around its largest events, which are generally during the second and fourth quarters. Corporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter of 2024 includes the rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, Quint results and other corporate overhead. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Formula One Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiaries, F1 and Quint. \n\n**LIBERTY LIVE GROUP** – In the third quarter, $3 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to Liberty Live Group. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty Live Group consist of Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation and other minority investments. \n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThere were no repurchases of Liberty Media’s common stock from August 1 through October 31, 2024. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media as of November 1, 2024 is $1.1 billion and can be applied to repurchases of common shares of any of the Liberty Media tracking stocks. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Media will discuss these headlines and other matters on Liberty Media's earnings conference call that will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

The 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable senior debentures due 2050 were redeemed in September 2024 and remaining exchange obligations were settled in October 2024.   \nc)  |  Net leverage as defined in F1’s credit facilities for covenant calculations.   \n  \nLiberty Media and F1 are in compliance with their debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\nIn August, Liberty Media issued 12.2 million shares of Series C Formula One common stock for $949 million gross proceeds to increase the cash consideration related to its planned acquisition of Dorna Sports, S.L., the parent company of MotoGP. Total cash and cash equivalents attributed to Formula One Group increased $1,175 million during the third quarter primarily due to the August equity issuance and cash from operations at F1. \n\nTotal debt at Formula One Group was relatively flat in the third quarter. In September, F1 refinanced its Term Loan B and extended the maturities of its facilities. The Term Loan A and revolving credit facility have been extended to mature in September 2029 and the Term Loan B has been extended to mature in September 2031. The margin on F1’s Term Loan B was permanently reduced from 2.25% to 2.00% with the potential to permanently step down to 1.75% if a certain leverage test is met on or after the earlier of the closing or termination of the MotoGP acquisition. As part of the terms obtained under the September refinancing, F1 also raised an incremental $850 million of Term Loan B commitment in addition to the incremental $150 million Term Loan A commitment obtained in April. The incremental term loans will be used to fund a portion of the MotoGP acquisition and are conditioned upon transaction close. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Liberty Live Group decreased $18 million during the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment, interest payments and corporate overhead. Total debt attributed to Liberty Live Group decreased $12 million during the quarter due to the redemption of a portion of the 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050. In August 2024, Liberty Media issued a redemption notice for all of its 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050. Any debentures that were not so purchased or properly surrendered for exchange were redeemed in full on September 1, 2024. In October 2024, Liberty Live Group settled the $50 million principal amount of the 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050 surrendered for exchange with cash on hand. \n\n**Important Notice:** Liberty Media Corporation (Nasdaq: FWONA, FWONK, LLYVA, LLYVK) will discuss Liberty Media's earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. \n\nLiberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n**Formula One Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  107  |  $  |  110   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  86  |  88   \nStock compensation expense  |  4  |  6   \nImpairment and acquisition costs(a) |  —  |  3   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  197  |  $  |  207   \n**Liberty Live Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  (5  |  )  |  $  |  (3  |  )   \nStock compensation expense  |  1  |  1   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  (4  |  )  |  $  |  (2  |  )   \n**Braves Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  (1  |  )  |  N/A   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  3  |  N/A   \nStock compensation expense  |  1  |  N/A   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  3  |  N/A   \n**Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  101  |  $  |  107   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  89  |  88   \nStock compensation expense  |  6  |  7   \nImpairment and acquisition costs  |  —  |  3   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  196  |  $  |  205   \n_________________________   \n---  \na)  |  During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Formula One Group incurred $3 million of costs related to corporate acquisitions.   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241106993785/en/>\n\nShane Kleinstein (720) 875-5432 \n\nSource: Liberty Media Corporation\n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### Looking For\n\n[ ![Liberty Broadband](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-broadband.svg) ](https://www.libertybroadband.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Qurate Retail](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-qurate.svg) ](http://www.libertyinteractive.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-tripadvisor.svg) ](http://libertytripadvisorholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Atlanta Braves Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/AtlantaBravesHoldingsLogo.svg) ](https://bravesholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nHi!

We are seeing continued momentum both in financial performance and amplification of our fanbase, including through expanding our methods of fan engagement. We have already announced our 24-race calendar for 2025, a landmark year that will mark the 75th anniversary of the FIA Formula One World Championship,” said Stefano Domenicali, Formula 1 President & CEO. “We recently published our first ever Impact Report and are proud to highlight that we are on track to reach our net zero target by 2030 and continue to prioritize our diversity and inclusion efforts with programs like the F1 Academy Discover Your Drive, STEM Challenge Days and more.” \n\nThe following table provides the operating results of Formula 1 (“F1”). \n\n1Q23  |  1Q24  |  % Change   \n---|---|---  \namounts in millions   \nPrimary Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  314  |  $  |  463  |  47  |  %   \nOther Formula 1 revenue  |  67  |  90  |  34  |  %   \nTotal Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  381  |  $  |  553  |  45  |  %   \nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation):   \nTeam payments  |  (112  |  )  |  (163  |  )  |  (46  |  )%   \nOther cost of Formula 1 revenue  |  (94  |  )  |  (123  |  )  |  (31  |  )%   \nCost of Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  (206  |  )  |  $  |  (286  |  )  |  (39  |  )%   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  (58  |  )  |  (59  |  )  |  (2  |  )%   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  117  |  $  |  208  |  78  |  %   \nDepreciation and Amortization(a) |  (82  |  )  |  (72  |  )  |  12  |  %   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  35  |  $  |  136  |  289  |  %   \nNumber of races in period  |  2  |  3   \na)  |  Includes $74 million and $61 million of amortization related to purchase accounting for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, that is excluded from calculations for purposes of team payments.   \n---|---  \n  \nPrimary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1’s revenue and is derived from (i) race promotion revenue, (ii) media rights fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. \n\nThere were three races held in the first quarter of 2024, compared to two races held in the first quarter of 2023. There are 24 events scheduled for the 2024 race calendar. \n\nPrimary F1 revenue increased in the first quarter with growth across race promotion, media rights and sponsorship partly driven by one more race held in the current period, which resulted in a greater proportion of season-based revenue recognized. Race promotion revenue also increased due to fees from the additional race held in the period and contractual increases in fees. Media rights revenue also benefited from contractual increases in fees, higher fees from new and renewed contractual agreements and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue also increased due to recognition of revenue from new sponsors and growth in revenue from existing contracts. Other F1 revenue increased in the first quarter primarily driven by the sale of new F2 cars and associated parts at the start of the new F2 vehicle cycle, higher hospitality and experiences revenue and higher freight income driven by the additional race held in the current period. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA(2) increased in the first quarter. Team payments were higher compared to the prior year due to the pro rata recognition of payments across the race season with one more race held, as well as an expectation of increased team payments for the full year. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased due to the cost of supplying the new F2 cars and associated parts, increased commissions and partner servicing costs associated with higher Primary F1 revenue streams as well as increased freight, travel, technical, digital and FIA regulatory costs from the additional race. Other cost of F1 revenue in the first quarter was also impacted by lease costs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, the 39-acre site in Las Vegas. Selling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat during the quarter. \n\nCorporate and Other Operating Results\n\nLiberty closed the Quint acquisition on January 2nd and began consolidating Quint results within the Corporate and Other segment. Corporate and Other revenue increased in the first quarter due to the Quint acquisition and $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Quint’s revenue is seasonal around its largest events, which are generally during the second and fourth quarters with the first quarter having modest event activity. Corporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter of 2024 includes the rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, Quint results and other corporate overhead. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Formula One Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiaries, F1 and Quint. \n\n**LIBERTY LIVE GROUP** – In the first quarter, $2 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to Liberty Live Group. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty Live Group consist of Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation and other minority investments. \n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThere were no repurchases of Liberty Media’s common stock from February 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media as of May 1, 2024 is $1.1 billion and can be applied to repurchases of common shares of any of the Liberty Media tracking stocks. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Media will discuss these headlines and other matters on Liberty Media's earnings conference call that will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on May 8, 2024.

financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group, Liberty Live Group and the former Braves Group, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. \n\nLiberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. \n\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY\n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  1Q23  |  1Q24   \n---|---|---  \n**Liberty SiriusXM Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  373  |  $  |  409   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  161  |  155   \nStock compensation expense  |  48  |  48   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs(a) |  32  |  13   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  614  |  $  |  625   \n**Formula One Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  16  |  $  |  95   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  84  |  86   \nStock compensation expense  |  5  |  12   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs(b) |  —  |  9   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  105  |  $  |  202   \n**Liberty Live Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  N/A  |  $  |  (2  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  N/A  |  —   \nStock compensation expense  |  N/A  |  1   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  N/A  |  $  |  (1  |  )   \n**Braves Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  (49  |  )  |  $  |  N/A   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  15  |  N/A   \nStock compensation expense  |  3  |  N/A   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  —  |  N/A   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  (31  |  )  |  $  |  N/A   \n**Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  340  |  $  |  502   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  260  |  241   \nStock compensation expense  |  56  |  61   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  32  |  22   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  688  |  $  |  826   \na)  |  During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Sirius XM Holdings recorded $12 million associated with severance and other employee costs and $1 million of impairments, primarily related to terminated software projects. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, Sirius XM Holdings recorded $23 million associated with severance and other employee costs and $9 million primarily related to a vacated office space.   \n---|---  \nb)  |  During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Formula One Group incurred $9 million of acquisition related costs associated with the completion of the Quint acquisition and the announcement of the company’s planned acquisition of MotoGP.   \n  \nSCHEDULE 2 \n\nThis press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone net income, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense (income) as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for (if applicable): (i) loss on extinguishment of debt, (ii) share-based payment expense, (iii) impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, (iv) legal settlements/reserves and (v) other significant operating expense (income) that do not relate to the on-going performance of SiriusXM’s business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance, which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXM’s operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXM’s satellite radio system, its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves, impairment, restructuring and acquisition related costs, to the extent they occur during the period, is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXM’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate SiriusXM’s operating results after giving effect for these costs, should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXM’s unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, SiriusXM’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Three Months Ended   \nMarch 31,   \n2023  |  2024   \n($ in millions)   \nNet income:  |  $  |  233  |  $  |  265   \nAdd back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  32  |  28   \nShare-based payment expense  |  45  |  45   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  136  |  140   \nInterest expense  |  107  |  104   \nOther (income) expense  |  (3  |  )  |  (12  |  )   \nIncome tax expense  |  75  |  80   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  625  |  $  |  650   \n  \nSCHEDULE 3 \n\nThis press release includes a presentation of free cash flow of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone cash flow provided by operating activities, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM’s free cash flow is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities, net of additions to property and equipment and purchases of other investments. Free cash flow is a metric that SiriusXM’s management and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by its operations, net of capital expenditures and other investment activity. In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, SiriusXM looks at its operating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate its ability to return capital to stockholders. SiriusXM excludes from free cash flow certain items that do not relate to the on-going performance of its business, such as cash flows related to acquisitions, strategic and short-term investments, including tax efficient investments in clean energy and net loan activity with related parties and other equity investees. SiriusXM believes free cash flow is an indicator of the long-term financial stability of its business. Free cash flow, which is reconciled to \"Net cash provided by operating activities,\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions \"Additions to property and equipment\" and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" from the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. SiriusXM believes free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding its current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to determine its financial condition, and to compare its operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. Free cash flow is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Three Months Ended   \nMarch 31,   \n2023  |  2024   \n($ in millions)   \n**Cash flow information**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  350  |  $  |  308   \nNet cash used in investing activities  |  $  |  (235  |  )  |  $  |  (363  |  )   \nNet cash used in financing activities  |  $  |  (119  |  )  |  $  |  (90  |  )   \n**Free cash flow**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  350  |  $  |  308   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (205  |  )  |  (174  |  )   \nPurchases of other investments  |  (1  |  )  |  (2  |  )   \n**Free cash flow** |  **$** |  **144** |  **$** |  **132**  \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240507436710/en/>\n\n**Liberty Media Corporation** Shane Kleinstein, (720) 875-5432 \n\nSource: Liberty Media Corporation\n\nReleased May 8, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### Looking For\n\n[ ![Liberty Broadband](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-broadband.svg) ](https://www.libertybroadband.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Qurate Retail](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-qurate.svg) ](http://www.libertyinteractive.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-tripadvisor.svg) ](http://libertytripadvisorholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Atlanta Braves Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/AtlantaBravesHoldingsLogo.svg) ](https://bravesholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nHi!

In the second quarter, Formula One Group incurred $14 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense). \n\n2Q23  |  2Q24   \n---|---  \namounts in millions   \n**Formula One Group**  \n**_Revenue_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  724  |  $  |  871   \nCorporate and other  |  —  |  141   \nIntergroup elimination  |  —  |  (24  |  )   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  724  |  $  |  988   \n**_Operating Income (Loss)_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  72  |  $  |  84   \nCorporate and other  |  (20  |  )  |  (25  |  )   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  52  |  $  |  59   \n**_Adjusted OIBDA (Loss)_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  155  |  $  |  160   \nCorporate and other  |  (14  |  )  |  5   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  141  |  $  |  165   \n  \nF1 Operating Results\n\n“The F1 season is seeing phenomenal racing, with seven different winners through fourteen races and tighter gaps across the grid. Social media followers are up over 30% across F1 platforms and we had 3.7 million race attendees through the first half of the season with ten sellout crowds,” said Stefano Domenicali, Formula 1 President and CEO. “F1 Academy is off to a strong start in its first season running all events alongside F1 race weekends. Together with the Sprint and FIA F2 and F3, it is adding to the exciting on-track action and bringing added value to our fans, promoters and sponsors.” \n\nThe following table provides the operating results of Formula 1 (“F1”). \n\n2Q23  |  2Q24  |  % Change   \n---|---|---  \namounts in millions   \nPrimary Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  618  |  $  |  739  |  20  |  %   \nOther Formula 1 revenue  |  106  |  132  |  25  |  %   \nTotal Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  724  |  $  |  871  |  20  |  %   \nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation):   \nTeam payments  |  (344  |  )  |  (435  |  )  |  (26  |  )%   \nOther cost of Formula 1 revenue  |  (175  |  )  |  (210  |  )  |  (20  |  )%   \nCost of Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  (519  |  )  |  $  |  (645  |  )  |  (24  |  )%   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  (50  |  )  |  (66  |  )  |  (32  |  )%   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  155  |  $  |  160  |  3  |  %   \nStock-based compensation  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  %   \nDepreciation and Amortization(a) |  (82  |  )  |  (75  |  )  |  9  |  %   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  72  |  $  |  84  |  17  |  %   \nNumber of races in period  |  6  |  8   \n___________________________  \na)  |  Includes $74 million and $61 million of amortization related to purchase accounting for the periods ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively, that is excluded from calculations for purposes of team payments.   \n---|---  \n  \nPrimary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1’s revenue and is derived from (i) race promotion revenue, (ii) media rights fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. \n\nThere were eight races held in the second quarter of 2024, compared to six races held in the second quarter of 2023. There are 24 events scheduled for the 2024 race calendar, compared to 22 events held in 2023. \n\nPrimary F1 revenue increased in the second quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partly driven by two more races held in the current period, which resulted in a greater proportion of season-based revenue recognized, as well as contractual increases in fees. Media rights revenue also benefited from continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue also increased due to the impact of the mix of races on event specific fees and recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Race promotion revenue was relatively flat in the second quarter as fees from the additional races were offset by the different mix of events compared to the prior year period. Other F1 revenue increased in the second quarter primarily due to higher hospitality, freight, travel, technical services and F2 and F3 income driven by the additional races held in the current period. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA(2) increased in the second quarter. Team payments increased due to the pro rata recognition of payments across the race season with two more races held in the current period and the expectation of higher team payments for the full year. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with growth in Primary F1 revenue streams as well as higher hospitality, FIA regulatory, digital, technical and travel costs from the additional races held in the current period. Other cost of F1 revenue in the second quarter was also impacted by higher costs associated with F1 Academy and lease expense for the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza which wasn’t incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased due to higher personnel, IT and property costs as well as legal and other professional fees, partially offset by lower marketing costs, foreign exchange favorability and bad debt recoveries. \n\nCorporate and Other Operating Results\n\nLiberty closed the Quint acquisition on January 2nd and began consolidating Quint results within the Corporate and Other segment. Corporate and Other revenue increased in the second quarter due to the Quint acquisition and $6 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. Quint’s revenue is seasonal around its largest events, which are generally during the second and fourth quarters, and in the second quarter Quint results were primarily driven by the Kentucky Derby and F1 Experiences across the eight races held. Corporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter of 2024 includes the rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, Quint results and other corporate overhead. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Formula One Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiaries, F1 and Quint. \n\n**LIBERTY LIVE GROUP** – In the second quarter, $2 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to Liberty Live Group. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty Live Group consist of Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation and other minority investments. \n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThere were no repurchases of Liberty Media’s common stock from May 1 through July 31, 2024. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media as of August 1, 2024 is $1.1 billion and can be applied to repurchases of common shares of any of the Liberty Media tracking stocks. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Media will discuss these headlines and other matters on Liberty Media's earnings conference call that will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on August 8, 2024.

Included in the cash and cash equivalents balance attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group at June 30, 2024 is $100 million held at SiriusXM. Although SiriusXM is a consolidated subsidiary, it is a separate public company with a non-controlling interest, therefore Liberty Media does not have ready access to SiriusXM’s cash balance. Liberty SiriusXM Group received $86 million of dividends from SiriusXM during the quarter. \n\nTotal debt attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group decreased $215 million during the quarter due to net debt repayment at SiriusXM and Liberty SiriusXM Group repaying $35 million under its SiriusXM margin loan. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Formula One Group increased $258 million during the quarter due to cash from operations at F1. Total debt at Formula One Group was relatively flat in the second quarter. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Liberty Live Group increased $108 million during the second quarter primarily due to the monetization of exchange-traded funds.

release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group, Liberty Live Group and the former Braves Group, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. \n\nLiberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  2Q23  |  2Q24   \n**Liberty SiriusXM Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  452  |  $  |  471   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  154  |  156   \nStock compensation expense  |  46  |  48   \nLegal settlements and reserves  |  24  |  —   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs(a) |  18  |  4   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  694  |  $  |  679   \n**Formula One Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  52  |  $  |  59   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  84  |  89   \nStock compensation expense  |  5  |  6   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs(b) |  —  |  11   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  141  |  $  |  165   \n**Liberty Live Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  N/A  |  $  |  (2)   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  N/A  |  —   \nStock compensation expense  |  N/A  |  1   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  N/A  |  $  |  (1)   \n**Braves Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  19  |  $  |  N/A   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  19  |  N/A   \nStock compensation expense  |  3  |  N/A   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  1  |  N/A   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  42  |  $  |  N/A   \n**Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  523  |  $  |  528   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  257  |  245   \nStock compensation expense  |  54  |  55   \nLegal settlements and reserves  |  24  |  —   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  19  |  15   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  877  |  $  |  843   \n___________________________  \n(a)  |  During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Sirius XM Holdings recorded $3 million associated with severance and other employee costs and $1 million of impairments, primarily related to vacated office space. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, SiriusXM recorded impairments primarily related to terminated software projects of $10 million, severance and other related costs of $5 million and a cost-method investment impairment of $2 million.   \n---|---  \n(b)  |  During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Formula One Group incurred $11 million of costs related to corporate acquisitions.   \n  \nSCHEDULE 2 \n\nThis press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone net income, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense (income) as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for (if applicable): (i) loss on extinguishment of debt, (ii) share-based payment expense, (iii) impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, (iv) legal settlements/reserves and (v) other significant operating expense (income) that do not relate to the on-going performance of SiriusXM’s business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance, which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXM’s operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXM’s satellite radio system, its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves, impairment, restructuring and acquisition related costs, to the extent they occur during the period, is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXM’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate SiriusXM’s operating results after giving effect for these costs, should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXM’s unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, SiriusXM’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Three Months Ended   \nJune 30,   \n2023  |  2024   \n($ in millions)   \nNet income:  |  $  |  310  |  $  |  316   \nAdd back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:   \nLegal settlements and reserves  |  24  |  —   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  18  |  18   \nShare-based payment expense  |  42  |  46   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  139  |  133   \nInterest expense  |  107  |  102   \nOther (income)  |  —  |  (2  |  )   \nIncome tax expense  |  62  |  89   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  702  |  $  |  702   \n  \nSCHEDULE 3 \n\nThis press release includes a presentation of free cash flow of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone cash flow provided by operating activities, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM’s free cash flow is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities, net of additions to property and equipment and purchases of other investments. Free cash flow is a metric that SiriusXM’s management and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by its operations, net of capital expenditures and other investment activity. In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, SiriusXM looks at its operating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate its ability to return capital to stockholders. SiriusXM excludes from free cash flow certain items that do not relate to the on-going performance of its business, such as cash flows related to acquisitions, strategic and short-term investments, including tax efficient investments in clean energy and net loan activity with related parties and other equity investees. SiriusXM believes free cash flow is an indicator of the long-term financial stability of its business. Free cash flow, which is reconciled to \"Net cash provided by operating activities,\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions \"Additions to property and equipment\" and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" from the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. SiriusXM believes free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding its current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to determine its financial condition, and to compare its operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. Free cash flow is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Three Months Ended   \nJune 30,   \n2023  |  2024   \n($ in millions)   \n**Cash flow information**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  451  |  $  |  514   \nNet cash used in investing activities  |  $  |  (130  |  )  |  $  |  (194  |  )   \nNet cash used in financing activities  |  $  |  (323  |  )  |  $  |  (291  |  )   \n**Free cash flow**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  451  |  $  |  514   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (128  |  )  |  (173  |  )   \nSales of other investments  |  -  |  2   \n**Free cash flow** |  **$** |  **323** |  **$** |  **343**  \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807046199/en/>\n\nShane Kleinstein (720) 875-5432 \n\nSource: Liberty Media Corporation\n\nReleased August 8, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### Looking For\n\n[ ![Liberty Broadband](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-broadband.svg) ](https://www.libertybroadband.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Qurate Retail](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-qurate.svg) ](http://www.libertyinteractive.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-tripadvisor.svg) ](http://libertytripadvisorholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Atlanta Braves Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/AtlantaBravesHoldingsLogo.svg) ](https://bravesholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nHi!

Headlines include(1): \n\n  * Completed combination of Liberty SiriusXM Group and SiriusXM on September 9th\n  * Attributed to Formula One Group \n    * Refinanced F1 debt facilities, extending maturities and reducing margin on Term Loan B from 2.25% to 2.00% with anticipated future step down to 1.75% \n    * Secured all funding for MotoGP transaction and on track to close by year-end 2024 \n      * Completed public offering of 12.2 million FWONK shares for $949 million gross proceeds in lieu of issuing equity to sellers \n      * Raised deal-contingent incremental $850 million Term Loan B and $150 million Term Loan A commitments \n    * F1 announced several new and expanded sponsorship agreements, including LVMH and Lenovo as Global Partners and American Express and Santander as Official Partners \n    * Signed multi-year licensing deals with LEGO and Mattel Hot Wheels which will see both brands launch F1 products in scale in 2025 \n  * Attributed to Liberty Live Group \n    * Fair value of Live Nation investment was $7.6 billion as of September 30th\n\n\n\n“The third quarter was active both at the corporate level and at our operating businesses. We closed the Liberty SiriusXM merger with SiriusXM, refinanced the F1 debt facilities and secured all necessary funding for our planned acquisition of MotoGP,” said Greg Maffei, Liberty Media President and CEO. “Formula 1’s commercial progress is incredible and we were thrilled to announce a number of hallmark deals beginning in 2025, including our new multi-year partnership with LVMH. Live Nation continues to see high global demand for their events and is already positioned for a very strong 2025 with increased stadium activity.” \n\nCorporate Updates\n\nOn September 9, 2024, Liberty Media completed the split-off (the “Split-Off”) of its wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (“Liberty Sirius XM Holdings”). Liberty Sirius XM Holdings was comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group immediately prior to the Split-Off. Following the Split-Off, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings merged with and into Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (“Sirius XM Holdings”), with Sirius XM Holdings surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings. As a result of these transactions, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is an independent company separate from Liberty Media and has been renamed Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in Liberty Media’s condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**FORMULA ONE GROUP** – The following table provides the financial results attributed to Formula One Group for the third quarter of 2024. In the third quarter, Formula One Group incurred $21 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense). \n\n3Q23  |  3Q24   \n---|---  \namounts in millions   \n**Formula One Group**  \n**_Revenue_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  887  |  $  |  861   \nCorporate and other  |  —  |  70   \nIntergroup elimination  |  —  |  (20  |  )   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  887  |  $  |  911   \n**_Operating Income (Loss)_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  132  |  $  |  146   \nCorporate and other  |  (25  |  )  |  (36  |  )   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  107  |  $  |  110   \n**_Adjusted OIBDA (Loss)_**  \nFormula 1  |  $  |  215  |  $  |  221   \nCorporate and other  |  (18  |  )  |  (14  |  )   \nTotal Formula One Group  |  $  |  197  |  $  |  207   \n  \nF1 Operating Results\n\n“Our business is benefitting from excellent competitive and financial momentum. We signed a ground-breaking partnership with LVMH for 2025, expanded our relationships with Lenovo and American Express, and secured licensing agreements with LEGO and Mattel’s Hot Wheels which expand F1 beyond our race calendar into the homes of our fans,” said Stefano Domenicali, Formula 1 President and CEO. “The thrilling racing and tight championship has benefitted viewership and digital engagement as the season has progressed. Race attendance is up season-to-date at 5.8 million with sellout crowds at nearly all races. It is great to see the on-track talent of both our seasoned drivers as well as young talent who hopefully have long F1 careers ahead.” \n\nThe following table provides the operating results of Formula 1 (“F1”). \n\n3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change   \n---|---|---  \namounts in millions   \nPrimary Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  790  |  $  |  758  |  (4  |  )%   \nOther Formula 1 revenue  |  97  |  103  |  6  |  %   \nTotal Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  887  |  $  |  861  |  (3  |  )%   \nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation):   \nTeam payments  |  (432  |  )  |  (371  |  )  |  14  |  %   \nOther cost of Formula 1 revenue  |  (183  |  )  |  (190  |  )  |  (4  |  )%   \nCost of Formula 1 revenue  |  $  |  (615  |  )  |  $  |  (561  |  )  |  9  |  %   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  (57  |  )  |  (79  |  )  |  (39  |  )%   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  215  |  $  |  221  |  3  |  %   \nStock-based compensation  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  %   \nDepreciation and Amortization(a) |  (82  |  )  |  (74  |  )  |  10  |  %   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  132  |  $  |  146  |  11  |  %   \nNumber of races in period  |  8  |  7   \n_________________________   \n---  \na)  |  Includes $74 million and $61 million of amortization related to purchase accounting for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively, that is excluded from calculations for purposes of team payments.   \n  \nPrimary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1’s revenue and is derived from (i) race promotion revenue, (ii) media rights fees and (iii) sponsorship fees. \n\nThere were seven races held in the third quarter of 2024, compared to eight races held in the third quarter of 2023. There are 24 events scheduled for the 2024 race calendar, compared to 22 events held in 2023. \n\nPrimary F1 revenue decreased in the third quarter due to less media rights and sponsorship revenue driven by one fewer race held in the current period which resulted in a lower proportion of season-based revenue recognized. Sponsorship revenue also decreased due to the impact of the mix of races on event specific fees, partially offset by recognition of revenue from new sponsors. The decline in media rights revenue recognized was partially offset by contractual increases in fees and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Race promotion revenue grew in the third quarter due to fees from the different mix of events held compared to the prior year period. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher licensing revenue and revenue generated from third-party events at the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, partially offset by lower hospitality income due to the mix of events in the current period. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA(2) increased in the third quarter. Team payments decreased due to the pro rata recognition of payments across the race season with one fewer race held in the current period, partially offset by the expectation of higher team payments for the full year. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with servicing Primary F1 revenue streams and higher digital costs, partially offset by lower FIA regulatory, technical, hospitality and travel costs due to the mix of events held. Other cost of F1 revenue in the third quarter was also impacted by higher costs associated with F1 Academy and lease expense for the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza which wasn’t incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased due to higher personnel, IT, property and marketing costs as well as legal and other professional fees, partially offset by foreign exchange favorability. \n\nCorporate and Other Operating Results\n\nCorporate and Other revenue increased in the second quarter due to the inclusion of Quint results and $7 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza. In the third quarter, Quint results were primarily driven by F1 Experiences across the seven races held. Quint’s revenue is seasonal around its largest events, which are generally during the second and fourth quarters. Corporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter of 2024 includes the rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, Quint results and other corporate overhead. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Formula One Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiaries, F1 and Quint. \n\n**LIBERTY LIVE GROUP** – In the third quarter, $3 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to Liberty Live Group. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty Live Group consist of Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation and other minority investments. \n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThere were no repurchases of Liberty Media’s common stock from August 1 through October 31, 2024. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media as of November 1, 2024 is $1.1 billion and can be applied to repurchases of common shares of any of the Liberty Media tracking stocks. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Media will discuss these headlines and other matters on Liberty Media's earnings conference call that will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

The 0.5% Live Nation exchangeable senior debentures due 2050 were redeemed in September 2024 and remaining exchange obligations were settled in October 2024.   \nc)  |  Net leverage as defined in F1’s credit facilities for covenant calculations.   \n  \nLiberty Media and F1 are in compliance with their debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\nIn August, Liberty Media issued 12.2 million shares of Series C Formula One common stock for $949 million gross proceeds to increase the cash consideration related to its planned acquisition of Dorna Sports, S.L., the parent company of MotoGP. Total cash and cash equivalents attributed to Formula One Group increased $1,175 million during the third quarter primarily due to the August equity issuance and cash from operations at F1. \n\nTotal debt at Formula One Group was relatively flat in the third quarter. In September, F1 refinanced its Term Loan B and extended the maturities of its facilities. The Term Loan A and revolving credit facility have been extended to mature in September 2029 and the Term Loan B has been extended to mature in September 2031. The margin on F1’s Term Loan B was permanently reduced from 2.25% to 2.00% with the potential to permanently step down to 1.75% if a certain leverage test is met on or after the earlier of the closing or termination of the MotoGP acquisition. As part of the terms obtained under the September refinancing, F1 also raised an incremental $850 million of Term Loan B commitment in addition to the incremental $150 million Term Loan A commitment obtained in April. The incremental term loans will be used to fund a portion of the MotoGP acquisition and are conditioned upon transaction close. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Liberty Live Group decreased $18 million during the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment, interest payments and corporate overhead. Total debt attributed to Liberty Live Group decreased $12 million during the quarter due to the redemption of a portion of the 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050. In August 2024, Liberty Media issued a redemption notice for all of its 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050. Any debentures that were not so purchased or properly surrendered for exchange were redeemed in full on September 1, 2024. In October 2024, Liberty Live Group settled the $50 million principal amount of the 0.5% exchangeable senior debentures due 2050 surrendered for exchange with cash on hand. \n\n**Important Notice:** Liberty Media Corporation (Nasdaq: FWONA, FWONK, LLYVA, LLYVK) will discuss Liberty Media's earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024.

Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. \n\nLiberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24   \n**Formula One Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  107  |  $  |  110   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  86  |  88   \nStock compensation expense  |  4  |  6   \nImpairment and acquisition costs(a) |  —  |  3   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  197  |  $  |  207   \n**Liberty Live Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  (5  |  )  |  $  |  (3  |  )   \nStock compensation expense  |  1  |  1   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  (4  |  )  |  $  |  (2  |  )   \n**Braves Group**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  (1  |  )  |  N/A   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  3  |  N/A   \nStock compensation expense  |  1  |  N/A   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  3  |  N/A   \n**Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  101  |  $  |  107   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  89  |  88   \nStock compensation expense  |  6  |  7   \nImpairment and acquisition costs  |  —  |  3   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  196  |  $  |  205   \n_________________________   \n---  \na)  |  During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Formula One Group incurred $3 million of costs related to corporate acquisitions.   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241106993785/en/>\n\nShane Kleinstein (720) 875-5432 \n\nSource: Liberty Media Corporation\n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### Looking For\n\n[ ![Liberty Broadband](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-broadband.svg) ](https://www.libertybroadband.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Qurate Retail](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-qurate.svg) ](http://www.libertyinteractive.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-tripadvisor.svg) ](http://libertytripadvisorholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Atlanta Braves Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/AtlantaBravesHoldingsLogo.svg) ](https://bravesholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nHi!

For the year ended December 31, 2023, these revenue streams comprised 29.3%, 32.2% and 18.0%, respectively, of total F1 revenue. \n\nThere were 22 and 6 races held in the full years and fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, F1 directly promoted the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix and recognized the revenue (ticketing, sponsorship, hospitality) and cost related to the event. \n\nPrimary F1 revenue grew in the full year and fourth quarter with increases across all revenue streams. Race promotion revenue grew primarily due to ticketing revenue from the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix and other contractual increases in fees. Race promotion revenue in the full year and fourth quarter also benefited from the mix of races held in each period compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. Sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from the Las Vegas Grand Prix, income from new sponsors and growth in revenue from existing sponsors. Media rights revenue grew due to increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Other F1 revenue increased in the full year and fourth quarter primarily driven by higher hospitality revenue generated from the delivery of hospitality and experiences at the Las Vegas Grand Prix as well as Paddock Club growth at other events, with full year growth partially offset by lower freight income driven by the easing of freight cost inflation on billing rates. \n\nOperating income and adjusted OIBDA(2) grew in the full year and fourth quarter. Team payments increased in the full year and fourth quarter driven by the growth in F1 revenue and the associated impact on the calculation of the team payments, which are 100% variable under the 2021 Concorde Agreement. Team payments as a percent of pre-team payment adjusted OIBDA decreased from 66% in 2022 to 63% in 2023 reflecting growth in adjusted OIBDA and an associated reduction on the payout percentage under the terms of the 2021 Concorde Agreement. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and is mostly derived from servicing both Primary and Other F1 revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the full year and fourth quarter primarily driven by the costs of promoting, organizing and delivering the Las Vegas Grand Prix as well as higher hospitality costs at other events associated with increased Paddock Club attendance and cost inflation, partially offset by significantly lower freight costs. Other cost of F1 revenue also increased in both periods due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with growth in Primary F1 revenue streams and higher travel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased for the full year due to higher personnel, IT and marketing costs as well as costs associated with planning and running the Las Vegas Grand Prix, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees and foreign exchange favorability. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased in the fourth quarter as higher personnel costs were offset primarily by foreign exchange favorability. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Formula One Group during the fourth quarter of 2023 consisted of Liberty Media’s subsidiary F1 and other minority investments, and as of January 3, 2024, consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiaries F1 and Quint, and other minority investments. \n\n**LIBERTY LIVE GROUP** – Liberty Live Group was allocated $6 million and $11 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, respectively. \n\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty Live Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s interest in Live Nation and other minority investments. \n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nThere were no repurchases of Liberty Media’s common stock from November 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media as of February 1, 2024 is $1.1 billion and can be applied to repurchases of common shares of any of the Liberty Media tracking stocks. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  Liberty Media will discuss these highlights and other matters on Liberty Media’s earnings conference call which will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on February 28, 2024.

Included in the cash and cash equivalents balance attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group at December 31, 2023 is $216 million held at SiriusXM. Although SiriusXM is a consolidated subsidiary, it is a separate public company with a non-controlling interest, therefore Liberty Media does not have ready access to SiriusXM’s cash balance. Liberty SiriusXM Group received $85 million of dividends from SiriusXM during the fourth quarter and $318 million of dividends for the full year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nTotal debt attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group decreased $434 million during the fourth quarter due to debt repayments at both Liberty SiriusXM Group and SiriusXM. During the quarter, Liberty SiriusXM Group retired the remaining $199 million outstanding principal amount of its 1.375% cash convertible notes with cash on hand and settled the remaining associated bond hedge and warrants, and paid down $80 million under its SiriusXM margin loan, in part using $61 million of proceeds received through the debt-for-equity exchange of 1.8 million shares of previously held Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock. SiriusXM reduced borrowing under its revolving credit facility and retired the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Pandora convertible senior notes due 2023 with cash during the fourth quarter. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Formula One Group decreased $62 million during the fourth quarter as cash from operations at F1 was more than offset by capital expenditures primarily related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Total debt attributed to Formula One Group was relatively flat in the fourth quarter. \n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents attributed to Liberty Live Group decreased $10 million during the fourth quarter primarily due to interest payments. Total debt attributed to Liberty Live Group was flat during the quarter. \n\n**Important Notice:** Liberty Media Corporation (Nasdaq: LSXMA, LSXMB, LSXMK, FWONA, FWONK, LLYVA, LLYVK) will discuss Liberty Media's earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 10:00 a.m. (E.T.) on February 28, 2024.

\n  \n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group, Liberty Live Group and the former Braves Group, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. \n\nLiberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months and years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\n_(amounts in millions)_ |  4Q22  |  4Q23  |  2022  |  2023   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Liberty SiriusXM Group**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  529  |  $  |  455  |  $  |  1,919  |  $  |  1,808   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  150  |  164  |  611  |  624   \nStock compensation expense  |  57  |  52  |  209  |  203   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, net of recoveries  |  (2  |  )  |  10  |  68  |  66   \nLitigation settlements, net of recoveries  |  —  |  7  |  —  |  31   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  734  |  $  |  688  |  $  |  2,807  |  $  |  2,732   \n**Formula One Group**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  41  |  $  |  122  |  $  |  173  |  $  |  297   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  90  |  115  |  362  |  369   \nStock compensation expense  |  4  |  6  |  16  |  20   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  135  |  $  |  243  |  $  |  551  |  $  |  686   \n**Liberty Live Group**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  NA  |  $  |  (6  |  )  |  NA  |  $  |  (11  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  NA  |  —  |  NA  |  —   \nStock compensation expense  |  NA  |  1  |  NA  |  2   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  NA  |  $  |  (5  |  )  |  NA  |  $  |  (9  |  )   \n**Braves Group**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  (31  |  )  |  NA  |  $  |  (28  |  )  |  $  |  (31  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  14  |  NA  |  71  |  37   \nStock compensation expense  |  3  |  NA  |  12  |  7   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, net of recoveries  |  1  |  NA  |  6  |  1   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  (13  |  )  |  NA  |  $  |  61  |  $  |  14   \n**Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated)**  \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  539  |  $  |  571  |  $  |  2,064  |  $  |  2,063   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  254  |  279  |  1,044  |  1,030   \nStock compensation expense  |  64  |  59  |  237  |  232   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, net of recoveries  |  (1  |  )  |  10  |  74  |  67   \nLitigation settlements, net of recoveries  |  —  |  7  |  —  |  31   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  856  |  $  |  926  |  $  |  3,419  |  $  |  3,423   \n  \nSCHEDULE 2 \n\nThis press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone net income, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense (income) as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for (if applicable): (i) loss on extinguishment of debt; (ii) share-based payment expense; (iii) impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs; (iv) legal settlements/reserves and (v) other significant operating expense (income) that do not relate to the on-going performance of SiriusXM’s business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance, which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXM’s operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXM’s satellite radio system, its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves, impairment, restructuring and acquisition related costs, and loss on extinguishment of debt, to the extent they occur during the period, is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXM’s statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate SiriusXM’s operating results after giving effect for these costs, should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXM’s unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, SiriusXM’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Years Ended   \nDecember 31,   \n2022  |  2023   \n($ in millions)   \nNet income:  |  $  |  1,213  |  $  |  1,258   \nAdd back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:   \nLegal settlements and reserves  |  —  |  24   \nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs  |  64  |  82   \nShare-based payment expense  |  197  |  184   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  536  |  554   \nInterest expense  |  422  |  423   \nOther expense (income)  |  9  |  5   \nIncome tax (benefit) expense  |  392  |  260   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  2,833  |  $  |  2,790   \n  \nSCHEDULE 3 \n\nThis press release includes a presentation of free cash flow of SiriusXM, which is a non-GAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM, together with a reconciliation to SiriusXM's stand-alone cash flow provided by operating activities, as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM’s free cash flow is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities plus insurance recoveries on its satellites, net of additions to property and equipment and purchases of other investments. Free cash flow is a metric that SiriusXM’s management and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by its operations, net of capital expenditures and other investment activity. In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, SiriusXM looks at its operating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate its ability to return capital to stockholders. SiriusXM excludes from free cash flow certain items that do not relate to the on-going performance of its business, such as cash flows related to acquisitions, strategic and short-term investments and net loan activity with related parties and other equity investees. SiriusXM believes free cash flow is an indicator of the long-term financial stability of its business. Free cash flow, which is reconciled to \"Net cash provided by operating activities,\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the captions \"Additions to property and equipment\" and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" from the unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an alternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. SiriusXM believes free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding its current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash flows from operating and investing activities), to determine its financial condition, and to compare its operating performance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. Free cash flow is calculated as follows: \n\nUnaudited   \n---  \nFor the Years Ended   \nDecember 31,   \n($ in millions)  |  2022  |  2023   \n**Cash Flow Information**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  1,976  |  $  |  1,850   \nNet cash used in investing activities  |  (548  |  )  |  (686  |  )   \nNet cash used in financing activities  |  (1,562  |  )  |  (1,005  |  )   \n**Free Cash Flow**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  1,976  |  $  |  1,850   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (426  |  )  |  (650  |  )   \nSales of other investments  |  1  |  3   \nFree cash flow  |  $  |  1,551  |  $  |  1,203   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240227626890/en/>\n\nShane Kleinstein, (720) 875-5432 \n\nSource: Liberty Media Corporation\n\nReleased February 28, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n#### Looking For\n\n[ ![Liberty Broadband](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-broadband.svg) ](https://www.libertybroadband.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Qurate Retail](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-qurate.svg) ](http://www.libertyinteractive.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Liberty Trip Advisor Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/logo-liberty-tripadvisor.svg) ](http://libertytripadvisorholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\") [ ![Atlanta Braves Holdings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d63cbcf356d0c3ce5579bac4cd799047/libertymedia/files/theme/images/AtlantaBravesHoldingsLogo.svg) ](https://bravesholdings.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nHi!
