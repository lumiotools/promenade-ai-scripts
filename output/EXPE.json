These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the\nperformance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should\nhave access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should\nbe considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for\nor superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in\nthat they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We\nendeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP\nmeasures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain\nitems related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash. We urge investors to review the\ndetailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis and Legal Proceedings\nsections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company's annual and quarterly reports\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may\nbe calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group adjusted for:\n(1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests;\n(2) provision for income taxes;\n(3) total other expenses, net;\n(4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans;\n(5) acquisition-related impacts, including\n(i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment,\n(ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and\n(iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree;\n(6) certain other items, including restructuring;\n(7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of\nissues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and\ncharges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional\ntax proceedings;\n(8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue\nrecognized in the period; and\n(9) depreciation.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or\nbecause the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders\ncomparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure\nfor analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful\ncomparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the\nresults of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of\nour business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain\nitems, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more\nclosely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of\nthe factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital\ninvestments are made and debt is serviced.\nAdjusted EBIT is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group adjusted for:\n(1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests;\n(2) provision for income taxes;\nPage 8 of 16\n(3) total other expenses, net;\n(4) acquisition-related impacts, including\n(i) goodwill and intangible asset impairment,\n(ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and\n(iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree;\n(5) certain other items, including restructuring;\n(6) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of\nissues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and\ncharges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional\ntax proceedings; and\n(7) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue\nrecognized in the period.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBIT measure because the amount and timing of these items is\nunpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less\nmeaningful. We believe Adjusted EBIT is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-\ngoing performance as this measure allows a more comprehensive comparison of our performance with our historical\nresults from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure\ninternally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and it allows investors to gain an understanding of\nthe factors and trends affecting profitability, including the ongoing costs to operating our business, which we believe\nare inclusive of non-cash items such as stock-based compensation.\nTrailing Twelve Month Financial Information\nExpedia Group includes certain unaudited financial information for the trailing twelve months (\"TTM\") ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, which is calculated as the nine months ended September 30, 2024 plus the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 less the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This presentation is not in accordance with\nGAAP. However, we believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding its recent\nfinancial performance, and it views this presentation of the four most recently completed fiscal quarters as a key\nmeasurement period for investors to assess its historical results.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course\noperations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income (loss) attributable to\nExpedia Group plus the following items, net of tax(a):\n(1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to equity plans of certain\nsubsidiaries and equity-method investments;\n(2) acquisition-related impacts, including;\n(i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and\nintangible asset impairment;\n(ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements;\n(iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; and\n(iv) gains (losses) recognized on non-controlling investment basis adjustments when we acquire or lose\ncontrolling interests;\n(3) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash;\n(4) the changes in fair value of equity investments;\n(5) certain other items, including restructuring charges;\n(6) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of\nissues related to transactional taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy and excise taxes), related court decisions and final\nsettlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in\ncertain transactional tax proceedings, including as part of equity method investments;\n(7) discontinued operations;\n(8) the non-controlling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items; and\n(9) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) includes preferred share dividends. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to\ninvestors because it represents Expedia Group's combined results, taking into account depreciation, which\nPage 9 of 16\nmanagement believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses and items\nnot directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.\n(a) Effective January 1, 2023, we changed our methodology for the computation of the effective tax rate used in the\ncalculation of adjusted net income to a long-term projected tax rate as we believe this tax rate provides better\nconsistency across reporting periods and produces results that are reflective of Expedia Group’s long-term effective\ntax rate. This projected effective tax rate is a total tax rate, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period-\nspecific income tax items which can vary in size and frequency. We apply this tax rate to pretax income, as adjusted\ncommensurate with our Adjusted Net Income definition. Based on our long-term projections, in 2023 and 2024 we\nare applying a 21.5% effective tax rate to compute Adjusted Net Income.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding,\nwhich, when applicable, include dilution from our convertible debt instruments per the treasury stock method for\nAdjusted EPS. The treasury stock method assumes we would elect to settle the principal amount of the debt for cash\nand the conversion premium for shares. If the conversion prices for such instruments exceed our average stock price\nfor the period, the instruments generally would have no impact to adjusted weighted average shares outstanding.\nThis differs from the GAAP method for dilution from our convertible debt instruments, which include them on an\nif-converted method. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis,\nExpedia Group's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of\ndoing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense,\ntaxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not\ndirectly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS have similar\nlimitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not include all items that affect our\nnet income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these\nmeasures along with our consolidated statements of operations.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management\nbelieves Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating\nbusinesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not\ndirectly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain\ninvesting activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease\nin the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures.\nTherefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdjusted Expenses (cost of revenue, direct and indirect selling and marketing, technology and content and general\nand administrative expenses) exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted\nstock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards.\nExpedia Group excludes stock-based compensation from these measures primarily because they are non-cash\nexpenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash\noperating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the\nvariety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting\nstandards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based\ncompensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating\nresults and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial\noperational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different\nperiods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based\ncompensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of\nemployees' compensation. Therefore, it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the\nNotes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item.\nExpedia Group, Inc. (excluding trivago) In order to provide increased transparency on the transaction-based\ncomponent of the business, Expedia Group is reporting results both in total and excluding trivago.\nPage 10 of 16\nTabular Reconciliations for Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization) by Segment(1)\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nCorporate &\nB2C B2B trivago Eliminations Total\n(In millions)\nOperating income $ 879 $ 285 $ 13 $ (415) $ 762\nRealized gain (loss) on revenue hedges 16 16 — — 32\nRestructuring and related reorganization charges,\nexcluding stock-based compensation — — — 6 6\nLegal reserves, occupancy tax and other — — — 59 59\nStock-based compensation — — — 147 147\nAmortization of intangible assets — — — 14 14\nDepreciation 133 37 1 26 197\nImpairment of intangible assets — — — 33 33\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 1,028 $ 338 $ 14 $ (130) $ 1,250\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nCorporate &\nB2C B2B trivago Eliminations Total\n(In millions)\nOperating income $ 935 $ 237 $ 16 $ (581) $ 607\nRealized gain (loss) on revenue hedges (16) — — — (16)\nStock-based compensation — — — 105 105\nAmortization of intangible assets — — — 14 14\nDepreciation 137 29 2 26 194\nImpairment of goodwill — — — 297 297\nImpairment of intangible assets — — — 15 15\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 1,056 $ 266 $ 18 $ (124) $ 1,216\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA for our B2C and B2B segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and facilities, the total costs of our\nglobal travel supply organizations, the majority of platform and marketplace technology costs, and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the\nforward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue.

These travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands\nincluding: Brand Expedia®, Hotels.com®, Expedia® Partner Solutions, Vrbo®, trivago®, Orbitz®, Travelocity®, Hotwire®, Wotif®, ebookers®, CheapTickets®,\nExpedia Group™ Media Solutions, CarRentals.com™ and Expedia CruisesTM. In addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to\nExpedia Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia Group,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” in these consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese accompanying financial statements present our results of operations, financial position and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements include Expedia Group, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and\nare the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to\nexercise significant influence, using the equity method or at fair value. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.\nWe have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting. We have included all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period. These\nadjustments consist of normal recurring items. Our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected\nfor any other interim period or for the full year. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”),\npreviously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). trivago is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, therefore is\nsubject to its own reporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to Expedia Group.\nAccounting Estimates\nWe use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our estimates and\nassumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our interim unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. Our actual financial results could\ndiffer significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates underlying our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition;\nrecoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy and\nexcise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses,\ncustomer refunds and chargebacks.\nReclassifications\nWe have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.\nSeasonality\nWe generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest\nin the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter.\nSince revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue\ntypically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically, Vrbo\nhas seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue\nimpact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer\nalignment to\n8\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nbooking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter\nand highest in the third quarter.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRecent Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new guidance that modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of\nreportable segments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n(\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. In addition, the new guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies\ncircumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single\nreportable segment, and contains other disclosure requirements. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance\non our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under the new guidance, public business entities must\nannually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if\nthe effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (loss) by the applicable statutory\nincome tax rate). The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are in the process of\nevaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBelow are the significant accounting policies with interim disclosure requirements. For a comprehensive description of our accounting policies, refer to our\n2023 Form 10-K.\nRevenue\nPrepaid Merchant Bookings. We classify payments made to suppliers in advance of Vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included\nwithin prepaid and other current assets. Prepaid merchant bookings was $333 million as of September 30, 2024 and $365 million as of December 31, 2023.\nDeferred Merchant Bookings. We classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings. At December 31,\n2023, $6.9 billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $5.7 billion of which was recognized resulting in $901 million of\nrevenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the related balance was $8.5 billion.\nAt December 31, 2023, $871 million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $678 million of which was recognized\nwithin revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the related balance was $946 million.\nDeferred Revenue. At December 31, 2023, $164 million was recorded as deferred revenue, $122 million of which was recognized as revenue during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the related balance was $173 million.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions. We have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar\ncharacteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. Using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ\nmaterially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. However, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards\nprogram is defined.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for\nwhich we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nCash, Restricted Cash, and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including money market funds and term deposit investments, with maturities of\nthree months or less when purchased. Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use\nthe cash for a specific purpose. Our restricted cash\n9\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nprimarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases. The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nreported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,722 $ 4,225\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 1,324 1,436\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 6,046 $ 5,661\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. We consider accounts\noutstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. The risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools\nprimarily include the type of receivable (for example, credit card vs hotel collect), collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For each pool, we\nmake estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due,\nprevious loss history continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The provision for estimated credit losses is recorded\nas cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded approximately $29 million of\nincremental allowance for expected uncollectible accounts, offset by $15 million of write-offs.\nNote 3 – Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 are classified using the fair value hierarchy in the table\nbelow:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2\n(In millions)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 164 $ 164 $ —\nTerm deposits and certificates of deposit 93 — 93\nCorporate debt securities 32 — 32\nU.S. treasury securities 15 — 15\nCommercial paper 7 — 7\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency forward contracts 34 — 34\nCross-currency interest rate swaps 3 — 3\nInvestments:\nEquity investments 705 705 —\nCorporate debt securities 284 — 284\nU.S. treasury securities 50 — 50\nAsset-backed securities 49 — 49\nTerm deposits and certificates of deposit 8 — 8\nU.S. agency securities 3 — 3\nTotal assets $ 1,447 $ 869 $ 578\n10\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 are classified using the fair value hierarchy in the table\nbelow:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2\n(In millions)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 168 $ 168 $ —\nTerm deposits 71 — 71\nDerivatives:\nCross-currency interest rate swaps 8 — 8\nInvestments:\nTerm deposits 28 — 28\nEquity investments 584 584 —\nTotal assets $ 859 $ 752 $ 107\nLiabilities\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 9 $ — $ 9\nWe classify our cash equivalents and investments within Level 1 and Level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or\nalternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange\nrates in active markets, a Level 2 input. Valuation of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is based on foreign currency exchange rates and the current interest rate\ncurve, Level 2 inputs.\nWe hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. Term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents.\nThose with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments and those with remaining maturities of greater than one year are\nclassified within long-term investments and other assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits, certificates of deposit, money market\nfunds, and corporate debt securities with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.\nWe primarily invest in investment grade corporate debt securities, U.S. treasury securities, and asset-backed securities, all of which are classified as available-\nfor-sale. As of September 30, 2024, we had $196 million of short-term and $198 million of long-term available-for-sale investments, which generally mature within 4\nyears. The amortized cost basis of the investments approximated their fair value with gross unrealized gains and losses of less than $1 million. We review our debt\nsecurities on a regular basis for impairment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of\nour investments.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our\nloyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we were party to outstanding forward contracts\nhedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $4.6 billion. We had a net forward asset of $34 million ($60 million gross forward asset) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of $9 million ($28 million gross forward liability) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We recorded $123 million and $(43) million in net gains (losses) from foreign\ncurrency forward contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as $65 million and $(58) million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nWe maintain two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million and maturity dates of February 2026.\nThe swaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign\noperations due to movements in foreign currency. The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $3 million and an $8 million asset as of as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. The gain recognized in interest expense was $4 million during both\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nOur equity investments include our marketable equity investments in Despegar and Global Business Travel Group, Inc., both publicly traded companies, which\nare included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we\nrecognized net gains (losses) of approximately $121 million and $(73) million within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value\nchanges of these equity investments.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments for which we have not elected\nthe fair value option, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. Such fair value measurements are\nbased predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by\nobservable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $297 million related to our trivago segment. This impairment\ncharge resulted from trivago’s recent strategic shift which included intensifying its brand marketing investments with an anticipated decrease in profitability. As a\nresult, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill for our trivago segment as of September\n30, 2023, in which we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value estimate for the reporting unit was based on a blended\nanalysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows\nmodel included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical\nperformance of the reporting unit and considered the weakening of operating results, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of\nthe assessment date. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size,\ngrowth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The\nexcess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2023. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, our trivago segment had no goodwill remaining.\nIntangible Assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized intangible impairment charges of $33 million related to an\nindefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment that resulted a decline in revenue in the current year as well as trivago’s share price decline reducing its total\nmarket capitalization relative to its assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized intangible impairment charges of $15 million,\nrelated to an indefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment that resulted from a decrease in the estimated royalty rate. The indefinite-lived trade name asset,\nclassified as a Level 3 measurement, was valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including projected revenues, royalty\nrates and weighted average cost of capital.\nMinority Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values of our minority\ninvestments without readily determinable fair values totaled $315 million and $330 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold a minority\ninvestment for $15 million and recognized an immaterial gain on the transaction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no material gains or\nlosses recognized related to these minority investments. As of September 30, 2024, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments\nincluded $105 million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).\n12\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nNote 4 – Debt\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding debt:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\n6.25% senior notes due 2025 $ 1,042 $ 1,039\n5.0% senior notes due 2026 748 748\n0% convertible senior notes due 2026 995 993\n4.625% senior notes due 2027 747 746\n3.8% senior notes due 2028 997 996\n3.25% senior notes due 2030 1,240 1,238\n2.95% senior notes due 2031 494 493\nTotal debt(1) 6,263 6,253\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt (1,042) —\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities $ 5,221 $ 6,253\n_______________\n(1) Net of applicable discounts and debt issuance costs.\nOutstanding Debt\nAdditional information about our $1 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “Convertible Notes”) and our\nother outstanding senior notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”), see Note 7 – Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAll of our outstanding Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations issued by Expedia Group and guaranteed by certain domestic Expedia Group subsidiaries.\nThe Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Expedia Group and the guarantor\nsubsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Notes include covenants that limit our ability to (i) create certain liens, (ii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions and (iii) merge\nor consolidate with or into another entity or transfer substantially all of our assets. The Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the holders\nthereof, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAccrued interest related to the Senior Notes was $48 million and $73 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nEstimated Fair Value. The total estimated fair value of our Senior Notes was approximately $5.2 billion and $5.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was $954 million and $953 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. The fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Facility\nAs of September 30, 2024, Expedia Group maintained a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures in April 2027. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an index rate\nplus a margin (a) in the case of term benchmark loans, ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, depending on Expedia Group’s credit ratings, and (b) in the case of\nbase rate loans, ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum, depending on Expedia Group’s credit ratings. A fee is payable quarterly in respect of undrawn\ncommitments under the revolving credit facility at a rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.25% per annum, depending on Expedia Group’s credit ratings. The terms of the\nrevolving credit facility require Expedia Group to not exceed a specified maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.\nThe revolving credit facility has a $120 million letter of credit (“LOC”) sublimit, and the amount of LOCs issued under the facility reduced the credit amount\navailable. Outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facility were $47 million and $40 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nNote 5 – Stockholders’ Equity\nTreasury Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s treasury stock was comprised of approximately 163.1 million shares of common stock and 7.3 million Class B\nshares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s treasury stock was comprised of approximately 150.6 million shares of common stock and 7.3 million Class B\nshares.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nShare Repurchase Programs. In October 2023, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board,\nauthorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock (“2023 Share Repurchase Program”). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwe repurchased, through open market transactions, 11.2 million shares under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program for a total cost of $1.5 billion, excluding\ntransaction costs and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, representing an average repurchase price of $132.04 per share. As of September 30,\n2024, $3.4 billion remains authorized for repurchase under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Our 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not have fixed expiration\ndates and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately\nnegotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be subject to the discretion of the Company and depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding the market price of Expedia Group’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations.\nSubsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares for a total cost of $126 million, excluding transaction costs and\nexcise tax, representing an average purchase price of $155.34 per share.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe balance of AOCI as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. These translation\nadjustments include foreign currency transaction gains as of September 30, 2024 of $2 million ($3 million before tax) and $6 million ($8 million before tax) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 associated with our cross-currency interest rate swaps as described in Note 3 – Fair Value Measurements. Additionally, translation adjustments\ninclude foreign currency transaction losses of $7 million ($10 million before tax) as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 associated with previously\nsettled Euro-denominated notes that were designated as net investment hedges.\nNote 6 – Earnings Per Share\nThe following table presents our basic and diluted earnings per share:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. $ 684 $ 425 $ 935 $ 665\nEarnings per share attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. available to common\nstockholders:\nBasic $ 5.28 $ 2.98 $ 7.07 $ 4.51\nDiluted 5.04 2.87 6.75 4.37\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding (000's):\nBasic 129,758 142,228 132,393 147,253\nDilutive effect of:\nConvertible Notes 3,921 3,921 3,921 3,921\nStock-based awards 2,053 1,599 2,341 998\nDiluted 135,732 147,748 138,655 152,172\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. The earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock\nand Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards and common\nstock warrants as determined under the treasury stock method and of our Convertible Notes using the if-converted method. In periods when we recognize a net loss,\nwe exclude the impact of outstanding stock awards and the potential share settlement impact related to our Convertible Notes from the diluted loss per share\ncalculation as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 3 million shares from\noutstanding stock awards have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would\nhave been antidilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 5 million shares of outstanding stock awards were excluded.\nNote 7 - Restructuring and Related Reorganization Charges\nIn February 2024, we committed to restructuring actions to recalibrate resources as most of the Company’s organizational\n14\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nand technological transformation is now completed, which have resulted in headcount reductions. As a result, we recognized $6 million and $72 million in\nrestructuring and related reorganization charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The charges were predominately related to employee\nseverance, stock-based compensation and benefit costs and approximately $11 million was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Based on current plans which are subject to change, we expect total reorganization charges in the remainder of\n2024 to be in the range of approximately $5 million to $10 million. These costs could be higher or lower should we make additional decisions in future periods that\nimpact our reorganization efforts.\nNote 8 – Income Taxes\nOur tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate. We record any changes affecting the estimated annual\neffective tax rate in the interim period in which the change occurs, including discrete items.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared to 31.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nchange in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a nondeductible goodwill impairment and nondeductible mark-to-market charges recorded in the prior year\nperiod.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was 23.5%, compared to 34.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nchange in the effective tax rate was primarily due to discrete tax effects of the TripAdvisor audit assessment recorded in the prior year period, as described below.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state, and foreign tax\nauthorities. For tax years 2011 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries. The 2011 to 2013 adjustments would result in federal income tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. The 2014 to 2016 adjustments\nwould result in federal income tax of approximately $431 million, subject to interest. We do not agree with these adjustments and will continue to vigorously defend\nour position through administrative procedures. We are also under examination by the IRS for tax years 2017 to 2020.\nOn December 20, 2011, we completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly traded corporation. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement between\nExpedia Group and TripAdvisor, TripAdvisor is responsible for its potential income tax liabilities in connection with any consolidated income tax returns filed as a\npart of Expedia Group’s consolidated income tax return prior to or in connection with the spin-off. TripAdvisor is required to indemnify Expedia Group for any such\ntaxes, including interest, penalties, legal, and professional fees.\nIn 2023, TripAdvisor agreed in principle with the IRS to an assessed amount of $120 million, inclusive of interest and state tax effects, for transfer pricing\nadjustments with its foreign subsidiaries for the 2009 to 2011 tax years. The assessment is a tax liability for tax years when TripAdvisor was part of Expedia Group's\nconsolidated income tax return and is covered by the indemnification pursuant to the tax sharing agreement. In May 2023, Expedia Group received from the IRS the\nfinal assessment for the 2009 through 2011 tax years related to the TripAdvisor matter. Expedia Group remitted $113 million in settlement payments to the IRS, as\nthe primary obligor for this assessment, and received the reimbursement required from TripAdvisor in settlement of the indemnification receivable for this matter.\nDuring 2023, we recorded a total of $67 million of additional income tax expense and a corresponding tax indemnification adjustment in other, net in our\nconsolidated statements of operations representing the estimate of the incremental assessed payment to the IRS, including state tax effects. During the second quarter\nof 2024, we recorded an additional $6 million of income tax expense related to interest adjustments for the 2010-2011 tax years.\nNote 9 – Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity,\nresults of operations, or financial condition of Expedia Group. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax,\ntransient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with\nrespect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the\nevent that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nLitigation Relating to Occupancy Taxes. One hundred three lawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and\nother taxes. Four lawsuits are currently active. These lawsuits are in various stages and we\n15\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\ncontinue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at\nissue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes or ordinances\nat issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar\naccommodations. To date, forty-nine of these lawsuits have been dismissed. Some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the\ngovernmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Thirty-four dismissals were based on a finding that we and the\nother defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. As a result of this litigation and other\nattempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes,\nconsistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $3 million and $46 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. The reserve balance decreased $43 million as of September 30, 2024 due to the favorable resolution of two cases during the year. Our\nsettlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities\nrecorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. Changes to the settlement reserve are included\nwithin legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPay-to-Play. Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the\nordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such\ntaxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was\nmade, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nWe are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including in the City of Los Angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes,\nmay impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.\nMatters Relating to International VAT. We are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of VAT\nto our European Union related transactions. While we believe we comply with applicable VAT laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax\nauthorities may determine that we owe additional taxes.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we entered into discussions with Italian authorities to resolve issues raised in a tax audit regarding the Company’s purported\nItalian VAT obligations. While no tax assessment has been issued and we believe that Expedia Group has complied with Italian tax laws, we recorded a reserve for\nthe potential settlement of these issues, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of\n$92 million as of September 30, 2024 within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations. Our settlement reserve is based on\nour best estimate and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Italy, we may be required to “pay-to-play” any VAT assessment prior to contesting its validity.\nWhile we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably\npossible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably\npossible amount of any such payments cannot be made.\nNote 10 – Segment Information\nWe have the following reportable segments: B2C, B2B, and trivago. Our B2C segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our\nworldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, CheapTickets,\nHotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment fuels a wide range of travel and non-travel companies including airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers,\ncorporate travel management and financial institutions, who leverage our leading travel technology and tap into our diverse supply to augment their offerings and\nmarket Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel\ncompanies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.\nWe determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate\noperating performance. Our primary operating metric is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our B2C and B2B segments includes allocations of certain\nexpenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and\nthe realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We\n16\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)\nbase the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources,\ncertain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations. Our allocation methodology is\nperiodically evaluated and may change.\nOur segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our B2C\nsegment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and\ntherefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment\ntransactions is included within Corporate and Eliminations in the table below.\nCorporate and Eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses. In addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related\nimpairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items\nexcluded from segment operating performance in Corporate and Eliminations.

We believe travel is a force for good. Travel is an essential human experience that\nstrengthens connections, broadens horizons and bridges divides. We help reduce the barriers to travel, making it easier, more enjoyable, more attainable and more\naccessible. We bring the world within reach for customers and partners around the globe. We leverage our supply portfolio, platform and technology capabilities\nacross an extensive portfolio of consumer brands, and provide solutions to our business partners, to empower travelers to efficiently research, plan, book and\nexperience travel. We make available, on a stand-alone and package basis, travel services provided by numerous lodging properties, airlines, car rental companies,\nactivities and experiences providers, cruise lines, alternative accommodations property owners and managers, and other travel product and service companies. We\nalso offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on\nour websites.\nAll percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.\nTrends\nStarting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, had an\nunprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. Travel was\nseverely depressed during 2020, with reduced levels of new bookings. In 2021, we began to see a bookings recovery. In 2022, there was a strong, but uneven,\nrecovery in travel demand with different regions around the world experiencing different rates of recovery. In 2023, the overall reopening of the Asia-Pacific region\nand general recovery outside of the United States was a factor in the gross bookings year-over-year growth rate for our B2B segment, but any other lingering impacts\nof the pandemic did not have a significant impact on our businesses, and we expect that to remain the case for future periods.\nMore recently, inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy, such as interest rates and currency fluctuations and energy\nprice volatility, as well as evolving geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. Our future operational results may be\nsubject to volatility, particularly in the short-term, due to the impact of the aforementioned trends. Broad, sustained negative economic impacts could put strain on\nour suppliers, business and service partners, which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions.\nAdditionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sustained\nlevels of increased inflation, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples\n20\nTable of Contents\nof other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future.\nDespite these factors, we have witnessed a healthy but more normalized travel demand environment in the first nine months of 2024, as consumers continue to\nprioritize spend on travel and experiences over other discretionary spending.\nOnline Travel\nIncreased usage and familiarity with the internet have continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. Online penetration is higher\nin the U.S. and Western European markets with online penetration rates in some emerging markets, such as Latin America and Eastern European regions, lagging\nbehind those regions. Emerging markets continue to present an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online\ntravel. The industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we have seen continued\ninterest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as Google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, and prioritizing its own AdWords\nand metasearch products such as Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights, in search results. Competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies, including\nKayak.com (owned by Booking Holdings), trivago (in which Expedia Group owns a majority interest) as well as TripAdvisor, introduced differentiated features,\npricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. Further, airlines and\nlodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. In addition, the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy,”\naccelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. Businesses such as Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com have emerged as the\nleaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. Other competitors have arisen, including vacation rental\nproperty managers, who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com. Additionally, traditional consumer ecommerce\nplayers have expanded their local offerings by adding hotel offers to their websites. Ride sharing app Uber has added transportation and experience offerings to its\napp via partnerships with other travel providers. Our B2B business has grown significantly but faces competition from other online travel agencies (“OTAs”) with\nB2B offerings, as well as other competitors, such as independent B2B businesses.\nThe online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which\nin some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in Europe. Expedia Group facilitates both\nmerchant (Expedia Collect) and agency (Hotel Collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid\nExpedia Traveler Preference (“ETP”) program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay Expedia Group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time\nof stay.\nIn 2022, we began evolving our strategy from being largely transactionally focused, where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers through\nperformance channels, to building a direct relationship with our customers by allocating more marketing spend towards our loyalty programs, paid app downloads,\nand brand awareness. While we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands, we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands:\nExpedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo.\nLodging\nLodging includes both hotel and alternative accommodations. As a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in the third quarter of 2024, lodging accounted\nfor 82%. Room nights booked grew 9% in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to growth of 12% in 2023 and 26% in 2022. Average Daily Rates (“ADRs”)\nbooked for Expedia Group declined 2% in the first nine months of 2024 and decreased 2% in 2023 and grew 3% in 2022. While trends are normalizing, our lodging\nbusiness has seen a significant increase in ADRs compared to pre-pandemic levels, which were driven by broader industry trends, a mix shift to Vrbo and high ADR\ngeographies.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our global lodging marketplace has over 3.5 million total lodging properties available. Our Vrbo brand has over 2.5 million online\nbookable alternative accommodations listings. Our other brands have over 1 million hotels and alternative accommodations.\nHotel. We generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). Our relationships and overall\neconomics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. As we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some\ncases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. These impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater\nglobal size and scale through faster overall room night growth. Additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, discounting, and\ncouponing have contributed to declines in revenue per room night and profitability in certain cases.\nFurther, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups.\nIn the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than\nthose available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty programs, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary benefits.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAlternative Accommodations. Over the past decade, we expanded into the alternative accommodations market. Vrbo is a leader, specializing in unique whole\nhome inventory, primarily in North American leisure markets, and represents an attractive growth opportunity for Expedia Group.\nVrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and\nproperty manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. Vrbo\noffers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. It also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings.\nSince our hotel and alternative accommodation supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in ADRs has an\nimpact on the revenue we earn per room night. In the future, we could see macroeconomic factors influence ADR trends, including rising living costs due to inflation\nand higher interest rates. Other factors that could lead to moderating ADRs include growth in hotel supply and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory.\nAir\nSimilar to the rest of travel, the airlines experienced a surge in pent-up demand when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, however they continued to operate at\nreduced capacity due to staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions. In 2023, airlines focused on adding capacity back to their networks, ending the year with\nglobal air capacity nearly recovered to 2019 levels.\nIn the future, we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to\nensure local coverage in new markets.\nBooked air tickets increased 5% in the first nine months of 2024, and increased 4% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. As a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in\nthe third quarter of 2024, air accounted for 3%.\nAdvertising & Media\nOur advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, and Expedia Group Media\nSolutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, we generated $464 million of advertising revenue from Expedia Group Media Solutions, a 35% increase from the same period\nin 2023.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, we generated $249 million of third-party revenue from trivago, a 9% decrease from the same period in 2023. Since the onset of\nCOVID-19, online travel agencies, including ourselves, have reduced marketing spend on trivago. In 2023, the company adopted its marketing strategy and launched\na new logo and visual identity, part of a push to rejuvenate its brand, demonstrate the relevance of its offerings and drive long-term growth.\nAs a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in the third quarter of 2024, total advertising and media accounted for 7%.\nBusiness Strategy\nAs we endeavor to power global travel for everyone, everywhere our focus is to leverage our brand, supply and platform technology strength to provide greater\nservices and value to our travelers, suppliers and business partners, and build longer-lasting direct relationships with our customers.\nWe believe the strength of our core brand portfolio and consistent enhancements to product and service offerings, combined with our global scale and broad-\nbased supply, drive increasing value to customers and customer demand. With our significant global audience of travelers, and our deep and broad selection of travel\nproducts, we are also able to provide value to supply partners seeking to grow their business through sophisticated technology, a better understanding of travel\nretailing and reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach. Our deep product and supply footprint allows us to tailor offerings to target different types of\nconsumers and travel needs, employ geographic segmentation in markets around the world, and leverage brand differentiation, among other benefits. We also market\nto consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search, metasearch and social and digital media. In 2024, we have accelerated our investments in\nglobal market expansion beyond our core markets that were our focus in the second half of 2023.\nDuring 2020, Expedia Group unified its technology, product, data engineering and data science teams to build services and capabilities that can be leveraged\nacross our business units to provide value-add services to our travel suppliers and serve our end customers. The unified team structure enables us to deliver more\nscalable services and operate more efficiently. We have also completed the migration of our core B2C brands onto a unified Brand Expedia technology front-end\ninfrastructure, having migrated Hotels.com onto the infrastructure in 2022 and Vrbo in 2023. In 2024, we will continue to cement our leadership in the B2B segment\nas our B2B business also benefits from all the work we have done in product and technology for our B2C brands.\n22\nTable of Contents\nAs we continue to mature our shared platform infrastructure, our focus is on developing configurable technical capabilities that support various travel products\nwhile using simpler, standard architecture and common applications and frameworks. We believe this strategy will enable us to: simultaneously build pieces of\ntechnology that work in tandem; ship new capabilities and features faster; create a foundation for more innovative solutions; and achieve greater economies of scope\nand scale. Ultimately, we believe this will result in more product improvements faster and therefore better traveler experiences. In addition, over time, as we execute\non our streamlined application development framework, we believe we can unlock additional platform service opportunities beyond the scope of our internal brands\nand business travel partners. All of our transaction-based businesses now benefit from our shared platform infrastructure, including customer servicing and support,\ndata centers, search capabilities, payment processing, and fraud operations.\nWe also launched One Key in the United States in 2023, which serves as the unified loyalty program under Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo, enabling\ntravelers to cross-earn and cross-redeem rewards across these brands and our range of products such as air, hotels and alternative accommodations. In 2024, we also\nrolled out One Key in the United Kingdom. With greatly improved product driven by the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities and One\nKey, we believe we will continue to drive greater retention, repeat and direct business.\nSeasonality\nWe generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest\nin the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter.\nSince revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue\ntypically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically, Vrbo\nhas seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue\nimpact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer\nalignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the\nfirst quarter and highest in the third quarter.\nThe growth in our B2B segment, international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, among others, may also influence the typical\ntrend of seasonality in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they\nrequire that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that\nwe make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and\nother assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an\naccounting estimate to be critical if:\n• It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were\nmaking the estimate; and\n• Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nFor additional information about our other critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 as well as updates in the current fiscal year provided in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and Other Taxes\nLegal Proceedings. We are currently involved in four lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel\noccupancy and other taxes. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or\nordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide, namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations, and, therefore, that we do not owe the\ntaxes that are\n23\nTable of Contents\nclaimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels\n(or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations.\nFor additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings, see Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings.\nWe have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting\nprinciples and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $3 million and $46 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nCertain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Maryland,\nPennsylvania, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, Nebraska, Vermont, Mississippi, and Virginia, the city of New\nYork, and the District of Columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other\naccommodations and/or car rental. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to\nvoluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. We are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation\nthe states of New York, New Jersey, South Carolina, North Carolina, Minnesota, Georgia, Wyoming, West Virginia, Oregon, Rhode Island, Montana, Maryland,\nKentucky, Maine, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, Vermont, Colorado, Mississippi, and\nVirginia, the city of New York and the District of Columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.\nPay-to-Play\nCertain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances.\nThis prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and,\neven when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the\njurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. However, any significant pay-to-play payment or\nlitigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity.\nOther Jurisdictions. We are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including the City of Los Angeles regarding\nhotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.\nSegments\nWe have the following reportable segments: B2C, B2B, and trivago. Our B2C segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our\nworldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, CheapTickets,\nHotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment fuels a wide range of travel and non-travel companies including airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers,\ncorporate travel management and financial institutions, who leverage our leading travel technology and tap into our diverse supply to augment their offerings and\nmarket Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel\ncompanies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.\nOperating Metrics\nOur operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and\nevaluating us. Gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking\nreflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. Revenue margin is defined\nas revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.\nGross Bookings and Revenue Margin\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nGross bookings $ 27,498 $ 25,685 7 % $ 86,499 $ 82,407 5 %\nRevenue margin (1) 14.8 % 15.3 % 12.1 % 12.1 %\n____________________________\n24\nTable of Contents\n(1) trivago, which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transaction-based websites, does not have associated gross bookings or\nrevenue margin. However, third-party revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross bookings increased 7% and 5%, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by\nlodging gross bookings due to continued strength in our hotel business. During the third quarter of 2024, we also saw a strong recovery in our air business as well as\ncontinued acceleration at Vrbo, which returned to modest growth for the quarter. The growth in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by\nsoftness in our Vrbo business earlier in the year. Booked room nights for our lodging business increased 9% for both the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\nRevenue margin decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to unfavorable impacts of foreign\nexchange and pricing actions as well as pressure from soft Vrbo bookings in the first half of 2024 translating as stays in the third quarter, which was partially offset\nof an uplift from advertising growth. Revenue margin remained consistent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nRevenue by Segment\nB2C $ 2,780 $ 2,819 (1)% $ 7,198 $ 7,155 1 %\nB2B 1,178 995 18 % 3,060 2,524 21 %\ntrivago (Third-party revenue) 102 115 (11)% 249 273 (9)%\nTotal revenue $ 4,060 $ 3,929 3 % $ 10,507 $ 9,952 6 %\nRevenue increased 3% and 6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, on strong growth in our B2B\nsegment resulting from increased lodging revenue.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nRevenue by Service Type\nLodging $ 3,317 $ 3,233 3 % $ 8,407 $ 7,960 6 %\nAir 104 100 6 % 330 324 2 %\nAdvertising and media(1) 269 240 12 % 713 616 16 %\nOther 370 356 4 % 1,057 1,052 — %\nTotal revenue $ 4,060 $ 3,929 3 % $ 10,507 $ 9,952 6 %\n____________________________\n(1) Includes third-party revenue from trivago as well as our transaction-based websites.\nLodging revenue increased 3% and 6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by an\nincrease in room nights stayed mostly in our hotel business.\nAir revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in air tickets sold.\nAir revenue remained consistent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nAdvertising and media revenue increased 12% and 16% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due\nto an increase at Expedia Group Media Solutions, partially offset by a decline in trivago revenue.

Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a $30 million charge related to digital service\ntaxes for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 retroactively enacted by Canada in June 2024 and our donation of $20 million as part of a public-private partnership project to\nrevitalize public parks along the Elliot Bay waterfront in Seattle, partially offset by an additional net reduction of to our reserve of $9 million for the favorable\nresolution of another tax related case. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the charges primarily included changes to our reserve related to other\ntaxes.\nRestructure and Related Reorganization Charges\nIn February 2024, we committed to restructuring actions to recalibrate resources as most of the Company’s organizational and technological transformation is\nnow completed, which have resulted in headcount reductions. As a result, we recognized $6 million and $72 million in restructuring and related reorganization\ncharges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were predominately related to employee severance, stock-based compensation and\nbenefits costs. Based on current plans which are subject to change, we expect total reorganization charges in the remainder of 2024 to be in the range of\napproximately $5 million to $10 million. These costs could be higher or lower should we make additional decisions in future periods that impact our reorganization\nefforts.\nOperating Income\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nOperating income $ 762 $ 607 26 % $ 1,103 $ 929 19 %\n% of revenue 18.8 % 15.5 % 10.5 % 9.3 %\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in operating income in the current year periods was primarily due to lower\nimpairment charges in the current periods, partially offset by the legal reserve, occupancy and other charges as well as the restructuring charges discussed above.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA by Segment\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nB2C $ 1,028 $ 1,056 (3)% $ 1,897 $ 1,857 2 %\nB2B 338 266 27 % 773 605 28 %\ntrivago 14 18 (17)% — 51 N/A\nUnallocated overhead costs (Corporate) (130) (124) 6 % (379) (365) 4 %\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 1,250 $ 1,216 3 % $ 2,291 $ 2,148 7 %\n____________________________\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

Our B2C segment Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of revenue growth. Our B2B segment experienced an improvement in Adjusted EBITDA during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily as a result of strong revenue growth. Our trivago segment Adjusted\nEBITDA decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of revenue declines resulting\nfrom headwinds in its performance marketing channels. The quarter-to-date period was impacted by lower marketing costs while the year-to-date period was\nimpacted by an increase in marketing costs.\nInterest Income and Expense\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nInterest income $ 67 $ 56 21 % $ 185 $ 162 15 %\nInterest expense (61) (62) — % (184) (184) — %\nInterest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of higher rates of return.\nInterest expense remained consistent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023.\nOther, Net\nOther, net is comprised of the following:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n($ in millions)\nForeign exchange rate gains (losses), net $ 32 $ (31) $ (29) $ (79)\nGains (losses) on minority equity investments, net 74 (127) 121 (73)\nTripAdvisor tax indemnification adjustment — — 6 67\nGain on sale of businesses and investments, net 2 — 5 24\nOther (2) 1 — 1\nTotal other, net $ 106 $ (157) $ 103 $ (60)\n29\nTable of Contents\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a $67 million gain, which together with amounts recorded in a prior period, represented the\nestimate of an indemnification reimbursement due to Expedia Group from TripAdvisor. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a $6\nmillion gain related to an indemnification receivable for additional interest due to the IRS. See “Provision for Income Taxes” below for the corresponding charge to\nincome tax expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\nProvision for income taxes $ 190 $ 139 37 % $ 284 $ 295 (4)%\nEffective tax rate 21.7 % 31.2 % 23.5 % 34.8 %\nOur tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate. We record any changes affecting the estimated annual tax\nrate in the interim period in which the change occurs, including discrete items.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared to 31.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nchange in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a nondeductible goodwill impairment and nondeductible mark-to-market charges recorded in the prior year\nperiod.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was 23.5%, compared to 34.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nchange in the effective tax rate was due to discrete tax effects of the TripAdvisor audit assessment recorded in the prior year period, as discussed further in Note 8 –\nIncome Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state, and foreign tax\nauthorities. For tax years 2011 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, the IRS issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 to 2013\nadjustments would result in federal income tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. The 2014 to 2016 adjustments would result in federal income tax\nof approximately $431 million, subject to interest. We do not agree with these adjustments and will continue to vigorously defend our position through administrative\nprocedures. We are also under examination by the IRS for tax years 2017 to 2020.\nIn December 2021, the OECD released model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations (“Pillar Two”). Certain\ncountries in which we operate have enacted legislation consistent with the OECD model rules effective beginning in 2024. We considered the applicable tax laws in\nrelevant jurisdictions and concluded there is no material impact to our tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to\nevaluate the potential impact of Pillar Two on future reporting periods.\nDefinition and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA is among the primary\nmetrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have\naccess to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in\naccordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into\naccount the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure\npresented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP\nmeasure. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review\nthe detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the Legal Proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measure used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests;\n(2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary\nequity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses)\nrecognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of\nthe acquiree, if any; (6) certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in\n30\nTable of Contents\nlegal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized\nin the period; and (9) depreciation.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items\nis unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a\nuseful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and\nprojected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to\nevaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-\nbased compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and\nallows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments\nare made and debt is serviced.\nThe reconciliation of net income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. $ 684 $ 425 $ 935 $ 665\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — (120) (12) (113)\nProvision for income taxes 190 139 284 295\nTotal other (income) expense, net (112) 163 (104) 82\nOperating income 762 607 1,103 929\nGain (loss) on revenue hedges related to revenue recognized 32 (16) — (12)\nRestructuring and related reorganization charges, excluding stock-based\ncompensation 6 — 64 —\nLegal reserves, occupancy tax and other 59 — 100 6\nStock-based compensation 147 105 365 314\nDepreciation and amortization 211 208 626 599\nImpairment of goodwill — 297 — 297\nImpairment of intangible assets 33 15 33 15\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,250 $ 1,216 $ 2,291 $ 2,148\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States was $633 million ($512 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries\nand $121 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). Our revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion was essentially untapped at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nOur credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024, Moody’s rating was Baa2 with an outlook of “stable,” S&P’s rating\nwas BBB with an outlook of “stable” and Fitch’s rating was BBB- with an outlook of “positive.” Changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position,\ncapital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various\nrating agencies. Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on\nour 6.25% senior notes, 4.625% senior notes as well as our 2.95% senior notes will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt as detailed in Note 4\n– Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred\nmerchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. For most\nother merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers’ use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the\nhotel\n31\nTable of Contents\nsuppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to\nus. Typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. Generally, during the first half of the year,\nhotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year, this pattern\ntypically reverses and cash flows are typically negative.\nOur cash flows are as follows:\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change\n(In millions)\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 2,887 $ 2,928 $ (41)\nInvesting activities (901) (635) (266)\nFinancing activities (1,590) (1,599) 9\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash\nequivalents (11) (53) 42\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent with net cash provided by operating activities in\nthe prior year period.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash used in investing activities of $901 million compared to $635 million in the prior year period.\nThe change was primarily due to net purchases of investments in the current period compared to sales of investments in the prior year period, partially offset by\nlower current period capital expenditures.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities primarily included $1.6 billion of cash paid to acquire shares, including\nthe repurchased shares under the authorization discussed below and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments, partially offset by $77\nmillion of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing\nactivities primarily included $1.7 billion of cash paid to acquire shares, including the repurchased shares under repurchase programs and for treasury stock activity\nrelated to the vesting of equity instruments, partially offset by $53 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans.\nIn October 2023, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board, authorized an additional program to\nrepurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock (“2023 Share Repurchase Program”). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased, through\nopen market transactions, 11.2 million shares under 2023 Share Repurchase Program for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion, excluding transaction costs and\nexcise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of September 30, 2024, $3.4 billion remain authorized for repurchase under the 2023 Share Repurchase\nProgram. Our 2023 Share Repurchase Programs does not have fixed expiration dates and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares.\nUnder the program, shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases\nwill be subject to the discretion of the Company and depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of Expedia Group’s common stock, general market\nand economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations.\nForeign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 of $11 million compared to $53 million decrease in the prior year period reflecting higher net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the\nU.S. dollar in the prior year period.\nOther than discussed above, there have been no material changes outside the normal course of business to our contractual obligations and commercial\ncommitments since December 31, 2023.\nIn our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost\nor availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nSummarized financial information of Expedia Group, Inc.

Booked hotel room nights include both merchant and agency hotel room nights. Property nights are related to our alternative accommodation business. \n\nBooked Air Tickets : Includes both merchant and agency air bookings. \n\nGross Bookings : Generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, adjusted for cancellations and refunds. \n\nLodging Metrics : Reported on a booked basis except for revenue, which is on a stayed basis. Lodging consists of both merchant and agency model hotel and alternative accommodations. \n\nB2C : The B2C segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, Hotwire.com, and CarRentals.com. \n\nB2B : The B2B segment fuels a wide range of travel and non-travel companies including airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers, corporate travel management and financial institutions, who leverage our leading travel technology and tap into our diverse supply to augment their offerings and market Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. \n\ntrivago : The trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its localized hotel metasearch websites. \n\nCorporate : Includes unallocated corporate expenses. \n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nExpedia Group reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT Margin, Leverage Ratio, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative), all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash. We urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis and Legal Proceedings sections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n_ Adjusted EBITDA _ is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group adjusted for: (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including \n\n(i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; \n\n(6) certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation. \n\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. \n\n_ Adjusted EBIT _ is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group adjusted for: (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) acquisition-related impacts, including \n\n(i) goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; \n\n(5) certain other items, including restructuring; (6) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings; and (7) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period. \n\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBIT measure because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBIT is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more comprehensive comparison of our performance with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and it allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting profitability, including the ongoing costs to operating our business, which we believe are inclusive of non-cash items such as stock-based compensation. \n\n_ Trailing Twelve Month Financial Information _\n\nExpedia Group includes certain unaudited financial information for the trailing twelve months (\"TTM\") ended September 30, 2024, which is calculated as the nine months ended September 30, 2024 plus the year ended December 31, 2023 less the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This presentation is not in accordance with GAAP. However, we believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding its recent financial performance, and it views this presentation of the four most recently completed fiscal quarters as a key measurement period for investors to assess its historical results. \n\n_ Adjusted Net Income (Loss) _ generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group plus the following items, net of tax (a) : (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to equity plans of certain subsidiaries and equity-method investments; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including; \n\n(i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment; (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; and (iv) gains (losses) recognized on non-controlling investment basis adjustments when we acquire or lose controlling interests; \n\n(3) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash; (4) the changes in fair value of equity investments; (5) certain other items, including restructuring charges; (6) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy and excise taxes), related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings, including as part of equity method investments; (7) discontinued operations; (8) the non-controlling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items; and (9) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net. \n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) includes preferred share dividends. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors because it represents Expedia Group's combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. \n\n(a)  Effective January 1, 2023, we changed our methodology for the computation of the effective tax rate used in the calculation of adjusted net income to a long-term projected tax rate as we believe this tax rate provides better consistency across reporting periods and produces results that are reflective of Expedia Group’s long-term effective tax rate. This projected effective tax rate is a total tax rate, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period- specific income tax items which can vary in size and frequency. We apply this tax rate to pretax income, as adjusted commensurate with our Adjusted Net Income definition. Based on our long-term projections, in 2023 and 2024 we are applying a 21.5% effective tax rate to compute Adjusted Net Income. \n\n_ Adjusted EPS _ is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which, when applicable, include dilution from our convertible debt instruments per the treasury stock method for Adjusted EPS. The treasury stock method assumes we would elect to settle the principal amount of the debt for cash and the conversion premium for shares. If the conversion prices for such instruments exceed our average stock price for the period, the instruments generally would have no impact to adjusted weighted average shares outstanding. This differs from the GAAP method for dilution from our convertible debt instruments, which include them on an if-converted method. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia Group's consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not include all items that affect our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations. \n\n_ Free Cash Flow _ is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\n_ Adjusted Expenses (cost of revenue, direct and indirect selling and marketing, technology and content and general and administrative expenses) _ exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards. Expedia Group excludes stock-based compensation from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees' compensation. Therefore, it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Notes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation by line item. \n\n_ Expedia Group, Inc. (excluding trivago) _ In order to provide increased transparency on the transaction-based component of the business, Expedia Group is reporting results both in total and excluding trivago. \n\n**Tabular Reconciliations for Non-GAAP Measures**\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization) by Segment (1) _\n\n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**B2C** |  **B2B** |  **trivago** |  **Corporate &** **Eliminations** |  **Total**  \n**(In millions)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  879  |  $  |  285  |  $  |  13  |  $  |  (415  |  )  |  $  |  762   \nRealized gain (loss) on revenue hedges  |  16  |  16  |  —  |  —  |  32   \nRestructuring and related reorganization charges, excluding stock-based compensation  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  6  |  6   \nLegal reserves, occupancy tax and other  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  59  |  59   \nStock-based compensation  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  147  |  147   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  14  |  14   \nDepreciation  |  133  |  37  |  1  |  26  |  197   \nImpairment of intangible assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  33  |  33   \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $  |  1,028  |  $  |  338  |  $  |  14  |  $  |  (130  |  )  |  $  |  1,250   \n  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**B2C** |  **B2B** |  **trivago** |  **Corporate &** **Eliminations** |  **Total**  \n**(In millions)**  \nOperating income  |  $  |  935  |  $  |  237  |  $  |  16  |  $  |  (581  |  )  |  $  |  607   \nRealized gain (loss) on revenue hedges  |  (16  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (16  |  )   \nStock-based compensation  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  105  |  105   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  14  |  14   \nDepreciation  |  137  |  29  |  2  |  26  |  194   \nImpairment of goodwill  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  297  |  297   \nImpairment of intangible assets  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  15  |  15   \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $  |  1,056  |  $  |  266  |  $  |  18  |  $  |  (124  |  )  |  $  |  1,216   \n  \n_(1) Adjusted EBITDA for our B2C and B2B segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and facilities, the total costs of our global travel supply organizations, the majority of platform and marketplace technology costs, and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics.

The study provides travel industry professionals with the context to better serve the increasing number of mass-affluent[2] (meaning middle-upper income) travelers from Asia and tailor offerings to their preferences. Conducted in partnership with Atomik Research, the study surveyed 4,000 respondents across Asia (China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam).\n\n\"We've witnessed firsthand the remarkable growth of the Asian travel market and are committed to providing unparalleled insights and solutions to our partners,” stated **Greg Schulze, Chief Commercial Officer of Expedia Group.** “By leveraging our industry-leading technology, extensive global network, and deep understanding of traveler behavior, we're able to deliver personalized experiences that resonate with Asian consumers. Our innovative platform empowers partners to reach travelers at every stage of their journey, from inspiration to booking and beyond.\"\n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_downloads/2024/10/HCOM_ICA_KR_ANANTI_BECKETT_WATSON_1078_72dpi_2.jpg)\n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_downloads/2024/10/HCOM_ICA_JP_HOSHINOYA_MAKINO_0675_03_QC_V1_72dpi.jpg)\n\n**Asian travelers expected to prioritize travel spending in 2025 despite inflation pressures.**\n\nThrough deals, discounts, and packages or — for many —a tendency to prioritize travel over other forms of discretionary spending, mass-affluent Asian consumers are finding ways to alleviate the impacts of inflation and keep room in their budget for travel. These travelers plan to spend an average of 23% of their income on travel in the next 12 months, and four in five (81%) report travel is a priority despite inflation. Moreover, near two in five (39%) said they would prioritize travel over buying a new car or over upgrading electronics, and close to one in three (32%) on dining out.[3]\n\n**Asian travelers expected to invest in long-haul trips, with multiple destination stops.**\n\nWhile many mass-affluent Asian travelers plan to visit other countries in the Eastern and Southeastern Asian regions, a significant number are drawn to international destinations farther afield. Overall countries such as Japan, the United States, Canada, France, South Korea, Australia, and Germany top their lists.\n\nOn average, these travelers plan four destinations over ten days for the next international trip. Interestingly, travel length and total destinations vary significantly across regions. Indian travelers plan for longer trips, averaging 14 days compared to Vietnam's with the lowest length at 8 days. Indian travelers often plan for five or more destinations on their next international trip, while Singaporean, Chinese, Vietnamese and Indonesian travelers often report planning for four or fewer. \n\nWhen it comes to travel planning, more than one in three respondents relied on travel agents, the majority (72%) said they use platforms like Expedia when booking. They commonly cite using a travel app for booking hotels (73%), booking flights (70%) and finding activities or excursions (52%). This reliance on digital tools is further emphasized by the fact that 83%[4] of people in Asia-Pacific have a travel brand’s app installed on their device, and 36% use the app regularly.\n\n**Asian travelers seek luxury travel experiences.**\n\nThe survey found that mass-affluent Asian travelers prioritize premium amenities and high-end accommodations, making these key factors for partners across the industry. To meet this demand, Expedia Group offers a wide range of tools and resources to help partners attract and convert these discerning travelers. \n\nIn terms of premium travel experiences on their next international trip, the vast majority (93%) of travelers plan to pursue at least one or more of the following:\n\n  * 44% seek airline upgrades (lounge access, meal and drink, etc.)\n  * 42% pursue room & accommodation upgrades (cabanas, honeymoon suites, etc.)\n  * 52% book a 4- or 5- star hotel\n  * 39% book private tours or excursions\n  * 38% book a seat in first class or business class\n\n\n\nDespite regional variations, flight upgrades, premium accommodations, and exclusive experiences are top of mind. Chinese, Singaporean, and Vietnamese travelers strongly prefer gourmet dining, while Indian travelers favor first-class or business-class seats and Indonesian travelers desired private tours. Across the board, airline and accommodation upgrades emerge as the two most popular choices. All-inclusive packages are one of the most likely buys among travelers in India (61%), Indonesia (61%) and Vietnam (58%).\n\n\"The mass-affluent consumer market in Asia is rapidly emerging as one of the most crucial population segments to reach and serve,\" stated **Peter O’Connor, Co-Director of the Centre for Enterprise Dynamics in Global Economies (C-EDGE) at the University of South Australia**. \"With their inclination towards long-haul trips and a preference for luxury amenities, they are poised to significantly impact the travel economy, as indicated by this research. Expedia Group's latest insights highlight the growing demand for personalized and premium travel experiences among Asian middle-class travelers.”\n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_downloads/2024/10/BEX_NMW_SICILY_LACALLETE_THERIN_2924_V02_72dpi.jpg)\n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_downloads/2024/10/BEX_NMW_SICILY_SELINUTE_THERIN_1669_V03_72dpi.jpg)\n\n**Travel suppliers have a unique opportunity to anticipate their specific concerns and needs.**\n\nNearly half (49%) of respondents feel some level of concern about understanding standard practices regarding local transportation, dining customs (43%), proper greetings (41%), and declaring baggage at customs (40%). More than one in three (34%) report the willingness to increase their spending to stay at a hotel with staff who speak their language. With these insights, partners can differentiate offerings with resources and services for first-time visitors.\n\nWhile 75% reported seeking deals, discounts, or packages for their next trip because of inflation, they still value luxury. Higher-spend priorities were luxurious room amenities (53%), experiential excursions (52%), cultural immersion (40%), and a hotel with a Michelin chef (31%). Partners should look to promote their inflation-busting deals while touting luxury amenities.\n\nLoyalty programs remain a significant draw for travelers. A vast majority (86%) of respondents report belonging to one, with airline, hotel, and credit card loyalty programs equally popular. This presents a unique opportunity for tourism boards to promote their destinations to these loyal consumers, especially during the early planning stages, when 30% said they had no specific destination in mind, or only the country but not the city.\n\nTo learn more about our study, click **[here](https://partner.expediagroup.com/en-us/resources/blog/asian-traveler-trends?brandcid=BRAND.EXPEDIA-GLOBAL.COMMS.CORPORATE.ASIANTRAVELERS.GENERIC)**.\n\n--------**About Expedia Group**\n\nExpedia Group, Inc. brands power travel for everyone, everywhere through our global platform.

The partnerships leverage advertising opportunities on Expedia Group’s own sites, brand-new opportunities within its B2B network, and offsite offerings including out-of-home, social media and connected TV placements. \n\nThese latest partnerships reflect Expedia Group’s mission to position its travel media network as a one-stop shop for advertisers looking to reach high-intent travelers around the world. Through its owned brands and partnerships, Expedia Group provides an unmatched combination of global reach with deep traveler insights, creative capabilities, media buying power, and measurement to connect brands effectively with their target audience. \n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_news/2024/10/KayakingGalenaCountry-303-cropped.jpg)\n\n**‘Middle of Unexpected’ with the Illinois Office of Tourism**\n\nThe “Middle of Unexpected” campaign encourages travel into Illinois and generates awareness beyond well-known cities like Chicago through domestic and international efforts, including Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, Australia and New Zealand. The campaign launched in April and ran through September, with nearly $27M attributed gross bookings, 16M impressions and 40k page views in the US through June. The campaign includes: \n\n  * Custom video content across CTV and social media, driving travelers to a custom [shoppable microsite](https://www.enjoyillinois.com/middle-of-everything/). \n  * **_NEW!_** Supply optimization in partnership with Expedia Group’s hotel and activity partners in market, who participated in discounted rates during the campaign. \n  * **_NEW!_** Targeted campaigns and webinars in the U.S. and U.K. for travel agents through Expedia Group’s Travel Agent Affiliate Program (TAAP), including an in-person event in the U.K.\n\n\n\n“Illinois has so much to offer, from its scenic byways to cultural touchstones, and we’re thrilled to bring the state’s wonder to more travelers,” said Daniel Thomas, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity, Office of Tourism. “While the campaign is still underway, we have seen a huge impact on driving interest in the state. In just three months, we’ve seen nearly 100,000 attributed travelers experience Illinois for its many points of interest and diverse landscape.” \n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/757635260/files/doc_news/2024/10/04.jpeg)\n\n**‘A Somewhere for Everyone’ with Brand USA**\n\nLaunching in November in Japan and Canada, Brand USA’s “A Somewhere for Everyone” campaign ensures travelers from far and wide have easier access to plan trips that will allow them to experience the diversity of people, places and experiences across the United States. Running through early 2025, the campaign activates the following through Expedia Group’s travel media network: \n\n  * A film produced by Expedia Group’s in-house creative team, depicting a family experiencing a joyful off-the-beaten-path road trip from San Francisco to Oregon. \n  * Video content displayed on digital-out-of-home, paid social media, YouTube and connected TV. \n  * A custom microsite where travelers can auto-generate custom “tri-tineraries” featuring three destinations with their “vibe” of choice, which can then be planned and booked directly on the site. The site includes links to plan and book their trip. \n  * **_NEW!_** Brand USA is among the [first wave of destination marketing organizations](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240916112655/en/EXPEDIA-TEAMS-UP-WITH-CREATORS-CELEBS-AND-KEY-PARTNERS-TO-LAUNCH-TRAVEL-SHOPS-BRINGING-SHOPPABLE-STOREFRONTS-TO-THE-TRAVEL-INDUSTRY) using Travel Shops. This first-of-its-kind shoppable storefront allows creators and brands to share and save travel recommendations on the Expedia app to attract travelers by highlighting the must-see experiences and accommodation options the USA has to offer. \n\n\n\n“We’re thrilled to continue our long-standing collaboration with Expedia Group through this latest, data-backed campaign,” said Susan Zachar, senior director of Brand, Brand USA. “As the nation’s destination marketing organization, Brand USA leads the effort to attract international visitors while driving innovation in reaching global travelers. By optimizing existing and leveraging new technologies, we ensure that travelers have the knowledge and access to fully experience the diversity and breadth of the United States.”\n\n“Our [research](https://go2.advertising.expedia.com/path-to-purchase-2023) shows that travelers view an average of 141 pages of travel content in the 45 days before booking a trip, and nearly 3 in 5 travelers don’t have a specific destination in mind or have considered multiple destinations,” says Rob Torres, SVP of Media Solutions at Expedia Group, “With the increasingly complex travel purchase journey, we’re focused on driving campaigns that make the media buying experience simple and effective. We’re grateful for partners that trust in our travel media network and its ability to deliver compelling results by connecting them with travelers when it matters most.”\n\n**About Expedia Group** Expedia Group, Inc. brands power travel for everyone, everywhere through our global platform.
