Lockton Re will use [Verisk’s agricultural risk modeling solutions](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l8qgU9vcUnaCsRVPShQrL54KVAaz_qppNLNEBpon8g3E7FFRXrE-xi3QgtFijNy_Pq6vLECyr9PAIAkk6cKQ7OzoZhxB7Uk3vizO-7JaVEwkD406iVFZOAdOHi6Y6Qdl12ZS6N1wFAfe2BvHULfVL5FJ_0CNCTaRObAabwoIhV4=) – including Verisk's Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and Crop Hail Model for the U.S. – to understand how climate change and meteorological factors are impacting crop production and potential insured losses. \n\nGiven significant changes to premium rates and commodity rates, simply relying on historical losses to assess today’s risk is insufficient for reinsurers and insurers. Verisk’s models offer comprehensive, scientific and stochastic insights into the risks facing the U.S. crop industry today, supporting clients seeking to maximize profitability and address the challenges of actuarial pricing in the market. \n\nVerisk’s models, including the U.S. Crop Hail Model, are unique in that they simulate hailstorms based on 10,000-year stochastic event catalogs. Lockton Re will utilise Verisk’s models for the most realistic view of loss scenarios, factoring in crop genetics, yields, prices, exposure, weather data, policy conditions and management practices. \n\n\"We’re embarking on a journey to advance risk management options for the U.S. crop (re)insurance industry,” said Kris Lynn, senior broker and agriculture practice leader at Lockton Re. “By incorporating advanced climate data and understanding the global impact of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on crop production, we’re able to offer reinsurers a data-driven approach to risk transfer and product innovation that hasn't been available before. There has been slow adoption of the data and analytics necessary to keep up with changing risk landscapes. We aim to change that.\" \n\n\"Lockton Re brings a fresh, disruptive perspective to the U.S. crop market, and we’re excited to support its innovative approach,” said Oscar Vergara, business development manager, agricultural modeling solutions for Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk. “By using our crop models, Lockton Re will be able to provide more informed, data-backed solutions that account for everything from hail damage to the effects of extreme weather events fueled by climate change. Reinsurers and insurers need a robust, up-to-date risk assessment model to help maximize profit within risk tolerance level.\" \n\n**Advancing****indexed** **solutions for agriculture risk**\n\nVerisk’s crop models will support Lockton Re’s development of new indexed products that will be designed to help (re)insurers address the increasing risks of a changing climate on agriculture production. Verisk’s models provide the (re)insurance industry with a reliable solution to understand individual crop policy risks. Using tools like Verisk’s Fund Designation Service, helps portfolio risk managers use the output to analyze the marginal impact on their profitability of adding new states for which underwriting history may be limited and optimize designation alternatives. \n\nThe U.S. crop insurance market has seen significant growth in recent years, with indexed insurance products—such as those Lockton Re is developing—gaining market share. According to the National Crop Insurance Services (NCIS), parametric products accounted for as much as 12.4 percent of the MPCI premium in 2023 across the U.S., with even higher shares in key states. \n\nLynn concludes, “As climate change continues to impact crop yields globally, the collaboration between Lockton Re and Verisk will provide insurers and reinsurers with the tools and insights they need to navigate an increasingly volatile landscape. This collaboration marks a new chapter in crop insurance, driven by data, analytics, and a commitment to improving risk transfer solutions.” \n\n### \n\n**About Lockton Re:** Lockton Re is a leading global reinsurance broker, delivering comprehensive risk transfer solutions and expert advisory services.

This score supports an insurers’ ability to accurately rate and underwrite personal lines homeowners risks.\n\nLOCATION PPS builds on Verisk’s LOCATION® Public Protection Classification® (PPC), the industry standard for community-based fire protection scoring used by more than 250 insurers. LOCATION PPC tracks the response capabilities of local fire departments across more than 36,000 fire protection areas and incorporates a range of grading criteria such as emergency communications, fire department, water supply and community risk reduction.\n\nConsistent with LOCATION PPC, LOCATION PPS leverages the Fire Suppression Rating Schedule (FSRS) criteria and is enhanced with inputs such as:\n\n  * Actual expected drive times between an address and the nearest responding fire station, based on localized traffic patterns in addition to distance.\n  * A proprietary data set of property-specific characteristics.\n  * Deeper granularity in the measurement of distance to water.\n\n\n\n“Insurers want stronger predictive performance and informative insights surrounding the properties they insure, and LOCATION PPS delivers,” said Austin Grigsby, associate vice president, personal property solutions at Verisk. “As with LOCATION PPC, fire departments and communities can impact LOCATION PPS scoring by updating and maintaining their fire suppression system and criteria – in turn, building more resilient communities.”\n\nAccording to [The National Fire Protection Association](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Y4VVWsygzIPgNrJLWSWVvORsSf1A7TEEjLtK9XmLAEFkMD2vTh14E4oj6gSlz0Qrwc9e13NYurq4egAP2wSPQCdS0IVBiyB9SVqnVjVtsAD95lzN3IJf_jcnITJg8hJP0JXOsHBqiuv9orB6p7CCn1ze9JlcWuQqu1vhQlKYIlf09UFryJwdc8qJ9h9_IkBj7OzQ_RLlCYIYTZ7ZsrHB5AUu0VP7-KwncndXWz74c6PXDKNsl9vdresYVkPrYD6d) (NFPA), U.S. local fire departments responded to an estimated 1.5 million fires in 2022, resulting in an estimated $18 billion in property damage. In addition, U.S. fire departments responded to house structure fires every 88 seconds that same year, underscoring the importance of LOCATION PPS’s enhancements.\n\nJames Roche, senior vice president of property product management at Verisk, added: “LOCATION PPS’s innovative efforts can provide insurance carriers greater granularity in fire protection assessment, which is essential for assessing the relationship between fire suppression and related losses. As an industry, it’s pivotal we account for all external factors that can impact response time and capabilities – because every second matters.”\n\nLOCATION PPS is now available in select markets.

We also continued our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase activity with the completion of our $400 million accelerated share repurchase in October 2024.\"\n\n**Summary of Results (GAAP and Non-GAAP) from Continuing Operations**(in millions, except per share amounts)Note: Adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenues| $| 725| 677| 7.0| %| $| 2,146| $| 2,004| 7.1| %  \nIncome from continuing operations| 220| 187| 17.4| 747| 586| 27.5  \nAdjusted EBITDA| 401| 366| 9.4| 1,178| 1,072| 10.0  \nDiluted EPS attributable to Verisk| 1.54| 1.29| 19.4| 5.22| 3.96| 31.8  \nDiluted adjusted EPS| 1.67| 1.52| 9.9| 5.04| 4.31| 16.9  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| 296| 250| 18.4| 889| 808| 9.9  \nFree cash flow| 241| 196| 22.9| 720| 635| 13.5  \n  \n**Revenues from Continuing Operations**\n\nConsolidated and OCC revenues increased 7.0% and 6.8%, respectively, with solid growth contributions from both underwriting and claims within Insurance.\n\n**Revenues and Revenue Growth**(in millions)Note: OCC revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure.\n\n**Revenue Growth**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **September 30, 2024**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported**| **OCC**  \nUnderwriting| $| 507| $| 475| 6.7| %| 6.5| %  \nClaims| 218| 202| 7.9| 7.4  \nInsurance| $| 725| $| 677| 7.0| 6.8  \n**Revenue Growth**  \n---  \n**Nine Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **September 30, 2024**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Reported**| **OCC**  \nUnderwriting| $| 1,513| $| 1,414| 7.0| %| 6.8| %  \nClaims| 633| 590| 7.3| 6.0  \nInsurance| $| 2,146| $| 2,004| 7.1| 6.5  \n  \nInsurance revenues grew 7.0% in the third quarter and 6.8% on an OCC basis. \n\n  * Underwriting revenues increased 6.7% in the quarter and 6.5% on an OCC basis, primarily due to our forms, rules and loss cost services and extreme event solutions.

The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and cost discipline, a litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million in the prior year associated with our former Financial Services segment, and a lower effective tax rate.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 9.4%, and 7.2% on an OCC basis, primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost discipline.\n\n**Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**(in millions)Note: Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

The increase in Diluted EPS was driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million in the prior year and a lower effective tax rate. Diluted adjusted EPS increased 9.9% to $1.67 for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting revenue and profit growth, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count due to our accelerated share repurchase program. \n\n**Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow**\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $296.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 18.4%, and free cash flow was $240.7 million, up 22.9%. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nOn September 30, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of September 15, 2024.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024, to holders of record as of December 13, 2024.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we initiated a $400 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, which was completed on October 25, 2024 and resulted in a repurchase of 1,515,616 shares at an average price of $263.92.

These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.\n\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law.\n\n**Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\n\n**EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses:** EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS:** Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.\n\n**Free Cash Flow:** Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\n\n**Organic:** Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity-method investments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\n\n**Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate:** Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\n\nSee page 10for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. See page 11for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\n\nWe are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted EPS, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\n\n**Attached Financial Statements**\n\nPlease refer to the full Form 10-Q filing for the complete financial statements and related notes.\n\n**VERISK

AAllll rriigghhttss rreesseerrvveedd.. 1\n3Q 2024 Earnings Presentation\nForward-Looking Statements, Safe Harbor, and Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. These statements relate to\nfuture events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of\nactivity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these\nforward-looking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the\ndetermination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation\ndeterminations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable\nterminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that\nare, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual\nreports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our\nunderlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our\ncurrent views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations,\ngrowth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents, or otherwise except as required by applicable securities laws.\nNotes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or\nan alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures\nprovides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of\nsenior management.\n©Verisk Analytics, Inc.

AAllll rriigghhttss rreesseerrvveedd.. 17\n3Q 2024 Earnings Presentation\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nSpecified Metrics\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and\nmay be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding\ncertain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting\nand planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses\nEBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv) provision for income taxes.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow for greater transparency regarding our operating\nperformance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions\n(which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We\nbelieve these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring\nitems.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure\nof the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make\nacquisitions.\nOrganic\nOrganic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and\nequity-method investments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of\nthe acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition\n(which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S.\nGAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic\npresentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for\nwhich results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial\ninformation to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the\ncurrency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating\nperformance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\n©Verisk Analytics, Inc.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting periods. Significant estimates include acquisition purchase price allocations, the fair value of goodwill and\nintangibles, the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities, acquisition-related liabilities, fair value of stock-based compensation\nfor stock options and performance share units granted, and assets and liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results\nmay ultimately differ from those estimates.\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, to present\nfairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our operating results for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared on the same basis\nas and should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain information\nand footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or\nomitted pursuant to the rules of the SEC. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to keep the information presented from being\nmisleading.\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business. We determined that the sale of our Energy business met\nthe “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 205-20, Discontinued Operations (“ASC 205-20”) due to its relative size and strategic rationale. The\nconsolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements were\nrecast for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the Energy business, in accordance with ASC 205-20. The discussion\nin the notes to these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to our continuing operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standard Description Effective Date Effect on Consolidated Financial\nStatements or Other Significant\nMatters\nSegment Reporting (Topic This update changes the reportable ASU No. 2023-07 is The adoption of this guidance is not\n280) In November 2023, segment disclosure requirements effective for fiscal years expected to have a material impact on\nthe FASB issued requiring enhanced disclosures about beginning after our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards significant segment expenses.

Revenues:\nDisaggregated revenues by type of service and by country are provided below for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023. No individual customer or country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10.0% or more of our consolidated revenues\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInsurance:\nUnderwriting $ 506.9 $ 475.2 $ 1,512.8 $ 1,413.7\nClaims 218.4 202.4 633.3 590.5\nTotal revenues $ 725.3 $ 677.6 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nUnited States $ 604.1 $ 564.9 $ 1,778.8 $ 1,680.1\nUnited Kingdom 53.3 48.5 156.2 140.4\nOther countries 67.9 64.2 211.1 183.7\nTotal revenues $ 725.3 $ 677.6 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2\n8\nTable of Contents\nContract assets are defined as an entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has\ntransferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had no contract assets. Contract liabilities are defined as an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to\na customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. As of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had contract liabilities that primarily related to unsatisfied performance obligations to provide\ncustomers with the right to use and update the online content over the remaining contract term of $502.0 million and $375.1 million,\nrespectively. Contract liabilities, which are current and noncurrent, are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other noncurrent\nliabilities\" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of the change in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024:\nContract liabilities at December 31, 2023 $ 375.1\nAdditions to contract liabilities 2,274.7\nRevenue (2,146.1 )\nForeign currency translation adjustment (1.7 )\nContract liabilities at September 30, 2024 $ 502.0\nOur most significant remaining performance obligations relate to providing customers with the right to use and update\nthe online content over the remaining contract term. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on\nthe requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting\nthe timing of satisfying the performance obligations. These performance obligations, which are expected to be satisfied within one\nyear, comprised approximately 99% of the balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWe recognize an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefits of those costs to\nbe longer than one year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had deferred commissions of $76.8 million and\n$76.4 million, respectively, which have been included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Other noncurrent assets\" in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\n9\nTable of Contents\n4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements:\nWe have certain assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. To increase consistency and comparability of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, ASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurements, established a three-level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nASC 820-10 requires disclosures detailing the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the methods and\nassumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we\napplied the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 - Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments.\nLevel 2 - Assets or liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.\nLevel 3 - Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market; instruments\nvalued based on the best available data, some of which are internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that\nmarket participants would require.'\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term\ndebt approximate their carrying amounts, because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Our investments in registered\ninvestment companies, which are Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, was $1.2 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. Our investments in registered investment companies are valued using quoted prices in active markets\nmultiplied by the number of shares owned and were included in \"Other current assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWe elected not to carry our long-term debt at fair value. The carrying value of the long-term debt represents amortized cost,\ninclusive of unamortized premium, and net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. We assess the fair value of these financial\ninstruments based on an estimate of interest rates available to us for financial instruments with similar features, our current credit\nrating, and spreads applicable to us. The following table summarizes the carrying value and estimated fair value of these financial\ninstruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair Value Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated\nHierarchy Value Fair Value Value Fair Value\nFinancial instruments not carried at fair value:\nSenior notes (Note 10) Level 2 $ 3,020.4 $ 2,986.1 $ 2,833.7 $ 2,735.3\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had securities without readily determinable market values of $196.4\nmillion and $200.9 million, respectively, which were accounted for at cost. We do not have the ability to exercise significant influence\nover the investees’ operating and financial policies and do not hold investments in common stock or in-substance common stock in\nsuch entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had investments in private companies of $26.4 million and\n$30.5 million, respectively, accounted for in accordance with ASC 323-10-25, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in\nCommon Stock (\"ASC 323-10-25\"), as equity method investments. All such investments were included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" in\nour accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no\nprovision for credit losses related to these investments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we settled retained interests in non-\npublic companies associated with previously disposed businesses and received proceeds of $112.1 million, resulting in a net gain\nof $98.3 million. The net gain was included in \"Investment gain (loss)\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\n10\nTable of Contents\n5. Leases:\nWe have operating and finance leases for corporate offices, data centers, and certain equipment that are accounted for under\nASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\").\nThe following table presents the consolidated lease cost and cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities for finance and operating leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost (1) $ 8.3 $ 8.2 $ 25.0 $ 25.6\nSublease income (1.1 ) (0.3 ) (3.2 ) (1.0 )\nFinance lease costs:\nDepreciation of finance lease assets (2) 5.0 3.8 14.3 10.6\nInterest on finance lease liabilities (3) 0.5 0.4 1.7 0.7\nTotal lease cost $ 12.7 $ 12.1 $ 37.8 $ 35.9\nOther information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ (9.0 ) $ (8.2 ) $ (25.6 ) $ (25.9 )\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases $ (0.5 ) $ (0.4 ) $ (1.7 ) $ (0.7 )\nFinancing cash outflows from finance leases $ (13.0 ) $ (10.4 ) $ (18.9 ) $ (13.2 )\n_______________\n(1) Included in \"Cost of revenues\" and \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations\n(2) Included in \"Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations\n(3) Included in \"Interest expense\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations\nThe following table presents weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for the\nconsolidated finance and operating leases as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases (in years) 7.2 8.4\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases (in years) 3.3 3.4\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 4.1 % 3.9 %\nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases 4.2 % 4.1 %\nOur right-of-use ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for finance leases were $52.8 million and $44.0 million, respectively, as\nof September 30, 2024. Our ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases were $41.2 million and $34.5 million, respectively, as\nof December 31, 2023. Our ROU assets for finance leases were included in \"Fixed assets, net\" in our accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our lease liabilities for finance leases were included in the \"Short-term debt and current portion of long-\nterm debt\" and \"Long-term debt\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10. Debt).\nOn August 16, 2024, we early vacated two floors within our Jersey City office. This transaction was accounted for as a lease\nmodification in accordance with ASC 842. As a result of the lease modification, we reassessed the accounting for the Jersey City\nlease, resulting in a reduction of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $11.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively, and recognition of a\ngain of $1.9 million. Additionally, we recorded an impairment of $7.6 million of the remaining net book value of leasehold\nimprovements.\nMaturities of lease liabilities for the remainder of 2024 and the years through 2029 and thereafter are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nYears Ending Operating Leases Finance Leases\n2024 $ 8.4 $ 4.3\n2025 33.6 21.5\n2026 31.7 10.7\n2027 31.3 8.9\n2028 29.8 4.3\n2029 and thereafter 91.4 —\nTotal lease payments 226.2 49.7\nLess: amount representing interest (30.7 ) (5.7 )\nPresent value of total lease payments $ 195.5 $ 44.0\n11\nTable of Contents\n6. Acquisitions:\n2024 Acquisitions\nOn January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH (\"Rocket\") for a net\ncash purchase price of $10.1 million, of which $2.2 million represents a deferred payment and $0.3 million represents a holdback\npayment. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill as we did not incur any material liabilities. Rocket’s strong\nproperty claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across\nGermany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by\nVerisk in Rocket in 2022, will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company’s goal of helping insurers and claims service\nproviders leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred transaction costs of $0.2 million and $0.3 million,\nrespectively. The transaction costs were included within \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. The 2024 acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statement of\noperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore, supplemental information disclosure on\nan unaudited pro forma basis is not presented.\nAcquisition Escrows and Related Liabilities\nPursuant to the related acquisition agreements, we have funded various escrow accounts to satisfy pre-acquisition indemnity\nand tax claims arising subsequent to the applicable acquisition dates. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the current\nportion of the escrows amounted to $0.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. There were no noncurrent portions of the escrows. The\ncurrent portion of the escrows have been included in \"Other current assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the acquisition of Krug Sachverständigen GmbH ('Krug'), Mavera Holding AB ('Mavera'), and\nMorning Data Limited ('Morning Data') included acquisition-related contingent payments, for which the sellers of these acquisitions\ncould receive additional payments by achieving the specific predetermined revenue, EBITDA, and/or EBITDA margin earn-out\ntargets for exceptional performance. We believe that the liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflect\nthe best estimate of acquisition-related contingent payments. The associated current portion of the contingent payments were $0.0\nmillion and $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The associated noncurrent portion of\ncontingent payments was $2.2 million and $2.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n12\nTable of Contents\n7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations:\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business to Planet Jersey Buyer Ltd, an entity that was formed on\nbehalf of, and is controlled by, The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and its affiliated funds and entities (“Veritas Capital”), for a net\ncash sale price of $3,066.4 million paid at closing (reflecting a base purchase price of $3,100.0 million, subject to customary purchase\nprice adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital, and indebtedness of the companies as of the closing) and up to\n$200.0 million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital’s future return on its investment paid\nthrough a Class C Partnership interest.\nThe Energy business, which was part of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was classified as discontinued\noperations per ASC 205-20 as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represented a strategic shift that\nhad a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from\ncontinuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.\nAdditionally, all assets and liabilities of the Energy business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the held for sale classification, we recognized an impairment\nof $303.7 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our\nconsolidated statement of operations. Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment within shareholders’ equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment.\nWhen we closed on the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we recognized a loss of $128.4 million. As a result of closing\nadjustments in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred an additional net loss of $2.7 million.\nThe following table presents the financial results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our consolidated\nstatement of income for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ — $ — $ — $ 46.8\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) — — — 18.2\nSelling, general and administrative — — — 33.1\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets — — — —\nAmortization of intangible assets — — — —\nOther operating loss, net — — — 135.3\nTotal operating expenses — — — 186.6\nOperating loss — — — (139.8 )\nOther expense:\nInvestment loss and others, net — — — (5.5 )\nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes — — — (145.3 )\nIncome tax expense — — — (0.2 )\nLoss from discontinued operations $ — $ — $ — $ (145.5 )\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows have not been adjusted to separately disclose cash flows related to discontinued\noperations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:\nThe following is a summary of the change in goodwill from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024, for our\nInsurance operating segment:\nInsurance\nGoodwill at December 31, 2023 $ 1,760.8\nAcquisitions(1) 10.6\nPurchase accounting reclassifications 0.3\nForeign currency translation adjustment 21.1\nGoodwill at September 30, 2024 $ 1,792.8\n_______________\n(1) See Note 6. Acquisitions for more information.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for\nimpairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or “Step Zero” impairment test, to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and\nmarket considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do\nnot perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amounts of our reporting units\nexceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If\nthe carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As\nof June 30, 2024, we completed our step zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was not more likely than not\nthat the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did not recognize any additional impairment charges\nrelated to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to\nmonitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did not identify any such events.\nImpairments to long lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $7.6 million. There were no\nimpairments to long lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During August 2024, we early vacated two\nfloors at our Jersey City, New Jersey, corporate headquarters. As a result, we assessed the related long-lived assets at the site\nfor impairment and recognized $7.6 million of impairment charges, primarily related to the write-off the remaining net book value\nof leasehold improvements.\nOur intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of the following:\nWeighted\nAverage Useful Accumulated\nLife (in years) Cost Amortization Net\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTechnology-based 8 $ 375.0 $ (286.2 ) $ 88.8\nMarketing-related 6 43.6 (40.8 ) 2.8\nContract-based 6 5.0 (5.0 ) —\nCustomer-related 13 549.4 (224.3 ) 325.1\nDatabase-based 8 15.4 (9.5 ) 5.9\nTotal intangible assets $ 988.4 $ (565.8 ) $ 422.6\nDecember 31, 2023\nTechnology-based 8 $ 370.2 $ (261.2 ) $ 109.0\nMarketing-related 6 42.7 (38.7 ) 4.0\nContract-based 6 5.0 (5.0 ) —\nCustomer-related 13 542.1 (190.7 ) 351.4\nDatabase-based 8 15.2 (7.9 ) 7.3\nTotal intangible assets $ 975.2 $ (503.5 ) $ 471.7\n14\nTable of Contents\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.3 million\nand $19.6 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 was $55.0 million and $56.1 million, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the remainder of 2024 and the years\nthrough 2029 and thereafter for intangible assets subject to amortization is as follows:\nYears Ending Amount\n2024 $ 17.5\n2025 63.6\n2026 61.7\n2027 53.4\n2028 46.2\n2029 and thereafter 180.2\nTotal $ 422.6\n15\nTable of Contents\n9. Income Taxes:\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.9% and 21.6% compared to the\neffective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 25.0% and 25.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to nondeductible litigation accruals recorded in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to tax charges\nincurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax benefits resulting from the Company's\nrecognition of capital gains arising from the settlement of our investment in non-public companies in the second\nquarter. The difference between statutory tax rates and our effective tax rate is primarily due to state and local taxes, partially offset\nby tax benefits attributable to equity compensation.\nA number of jurisdictions have begun to enact legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment’s 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024.

Leases\nSenior Notes\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of\n$3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million outstanding, respectively, and were in compliance with our financial and other covenants.\nOn June 5, 2024, we completed an issuance of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due\n2034 (the \"2034 Senior Notes\"). The 2034 Senior Notes will mature on June 5, 2034 and accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per\nannum. Interest is payable semiannually on June 5th and December 5th of each year, beginning December 5th,\n2024. The 2034 Senior Notes were issued at a discount of $9.8 million and we incurred debt issuance costs of $5.6 million. The\noriginal issuance discount and debt issuance costs were recorded in \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets and these costs will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over\nthe life of the 2034 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Senior Notes were utilized partially for the tender\noffer of 4.00% senior notes due in 2025 (\"2025 Senior Notes\") and general corporate purposes. The indenture governing\nthe 2034 Senior Notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and\nconsolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person\nor entity.\nOn June 7, 2024, we completed a cash tender offer for $400.0 million, or 44.4%, of the aggregate principal amount of the\n2025 Senior Notes. The consideration offered for each $1,000.0 principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes was $987.09 (the\n\"Purchase Price\"). Net cash proceeds of the 2034 Senior Notes were used to pay the Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest. This reduced the outstanding balance to $500.0 million. We recognized a $3.6 million net gain on debt extinguishment\ncomprised of $5.2 million for the discount paid below par, partially offset by $1.6 million of costs charged to expense on early debt\nmodification, which were recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nCredit Facilities\nWe have a syndicated revolving credit facility (\"Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility\") with a borrowing capacity of\n$1,000.0 million with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National\nAssociation, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust\nCompany. The Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and\ncapital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"). As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under our Syndicated Revolving Credit\nFacility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was\n$995.5 million and $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.5 million and $4.6 million,\nrespectively.\n17\nTable of Contents\n11. Stockholders’ Equity:\nWe have 2,000,000,000 shares of authorized common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our common\nshares have rights to any dividend declared by the board of directors (the \"Board\"), subject to any preferential or other rights of any\noutstanding preferred stock, and voting rights to elect all current members of the Board. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the adjusted closing price of our common stock was $267.96 and $238.86 per share, respectively.\nWe have 80,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The preferred shares have preferential\nrights over the common shares with respect to dividends and net distribution upon liquidation. We did not issue any preferred shares\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOn February 14, 2024, April 24, 2024, and July 24, 2024, our Board approved a cash dividend of $0.39 per share of common\nstock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of March 15, 2024, June 15, 2024, and September 15, 2024, respectively. Cash\ndividends of $166.6 million and $147.9 million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.\nOn October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and\noutstanding. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024, to holders of record as of December 13, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn December 2023, March 2024, and June 2024, we entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements (the\n\"December 2023 ASR Agreement\", \"March 2024 ASR Agreement\", and \"June 2024 ASR Agreement\") to repurchase shares of\nour common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million, $200.0 million, and $150.0 million, with Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Citibank, N.A, respectively. All ASR agreements are accounted for as a treasury stock\ntransaction and forward stock purchase agreement indexed to our common stock. The forward stock purchase agreements\nare classified as equity instruments under ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (\"ASC 815-40\") and deemed to have a fair\nvalue of zero at the respective effective date. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to stockholder's equity in our\ncondensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholder's equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon payment\nof the aggregate purchase price on December 14, 2023, March 13, 2024, and June 13, 2024, we received initial deliveries of\n873,479, 714,046, and 483,761 shares of our common stock, respectively. Upon the final settlement of the December 2023 ASR\nAgreement, the March 2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement, in February 2024, April 2024, and July 2024, we\nreceived 178,227, 148,286, and 68,645 additional shares as determined based on the volume weighted average share price of our\ncommon stock, less a discount, of $237.71, $231.93, and $271.54 during the term of the December 2023 ASR Agreement, the March\n2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement, respectively. These repurchases for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and\ndiluted earnings per share (\"EPS\").\nIn August 2024, we entered into an additional ASR agreement (the \"August 2024 ASR Agreement\") to repurchase shares of\nour common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. Upon payment of the aggregate\npurchase price on August 7, 2024, we received an initial delivery of 1,302,981 shares of our common stock. The initial share\ndelivery reduced our outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS.\nUpon the final settlement of the August 2024 ASR Agreement in October 2024, we received 212,635 additional shares, as determined\nbased on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock, less a discount, of $263.92 during the term of the August\n2024 ASR Agreement.\nWe utilized cash received from operations for these repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, we had $891.5 million available\non our authorization to repurchase shares.\nThrough the third quarter of 2024, we recorded total excise tax of $30.0 million, which has been included within treasury\nstock, as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased, and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTreasury Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, our treasury stock consisted of 402,606,293 shares of common stock, carried at cost. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we transferred 983,962 shares of common stock from the treasury shares at a weighted\naverage treasury stock price of $23.25 per share.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Verisk by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator\nis increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding, using the treasury stock method, if\nthe dilutive potential common shares, including vested and nonvested stock options, nonvested restricted stock awards, nonvested\nrestricted stock units, nonvested performance share units (\"PSU\"), and nonvested deferred stock units, had been issued.\nThe following is a presentation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator used in basic and diluted

Equity Compensation Plans:\nAll of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, deferred stock units, and PSUs are covered under our 2021\nIncentive Plan or our 2013 Incentive Plan. Awards under our 2021 Incentive Plan may include one or more of the following types:\n(i) stock options (both nonqualified and incentive stock options), (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) restricted stock, (iv) restricted\nstock units, (v) performance awards, (vi) other share-based awards, and (vii) cash. Employees, non-employee directors, and\nconsultants are eligible for awards under our 2021 Incentive Plan. We transferred common stock under these plans from our treasury\nshares. As of September 30, 2024, there were 12,811,487 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our\n2021 Incentive Plan. Cash received from stock option exercises for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 was $110.6 million and $134.3 million, respectively.\nWe grant equity awards to our key employees. The nonqualified stock options have an exercise price equal to the adjusted\nclosing price of our common stock on the grant date, with a ten-year contractual term. The fair value of the restricted stock is\ndetermined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock is not assignable or transferable until it\nbecomes vested. PSUs vest at the end of a three-year performance period, subject to the recipient’s continued service. Each PSU\nrepresents the right to receive one share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain\nmarket and financial performance criteria and may range from 0% to 200% of the recipient’s target levels of 100% established on the\ngrant date. The fair value of PSUs based on market conditions is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation\nmodel. The fair value of PSUs based on financial performance conditions is determined using the closing price of our common stock\non the grant date. We recognize the expense of the equity awards ratably over the vesting period, which could be up to four years.\nIn January 2024, we granted 199,776 nonqualified stock options, 129,789 shares of restricted stock, and 47,838 PSUs to key\nemployees. The nonqualified stock options and restricted stock have a graded service vesting period of four years. The PSUs granted\nconsisted of 29,929 PSUs that are based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return as compared to the companies that\ncomprise the S&P 500 index (\"TSR-based PSUs\") and 17,909 PSUs that are tied to the achievement of certain financial performance\nconditions, namely incremental return on invested capital (“ROIC-based PSUs”). Each of the TSR-based PSUs and ROIC-based PSUs\nhave a three-year performance period, subject to the recipients' continued service. The grant date fair value of the ROIC-based PSUs is\ndetermined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The related performance condition is driven by the\nincremental return on invested capital based on net operating profit. The ultimate realization of the PSUs may range from 0% to 200%\nof the recipient’s target levels established on the grant date.\nA summary of the status of the stock options, restricted stock, and PSUs awarded under our 2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans as\nof December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 and changes during the interim period are presented below:\nStock Option Restricted Stock PSU\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nWeighted Grant Grant\nAverage Aggregate Date Fair Date Fair\nNumber of Exercise Intrinsic Number of Value Per Number of Value Per\nShares Price Value Shares Share Shares Share\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 2,712,510 $ 143.91 $ 257.6 291,039 $ 186.28 181,236 $ 199.62\nGranted 203,884 $ 237.10 151,242 $ 237.11 47,838 $ 265.94\nDividend reinvestment — $ — — $ — 825 N/A\nExercised or lapsed (873,272 ) $ 126.50 $ 110.0 (104,359 ) $ 187.80 (47,821 ) $ 210.07\nCanceled, expired or forfeited (24,530 ) $ 202.41 (15,732 ) $ 206.87 (1,870 ) $ 210.07\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 2,018,592 $ 160.13 $ 217.7 322,190 $ 208.87 180,208 $ 205.10\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 1,428,502 $ 141.31 $ 180.9\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 1,947,253 $ 127.43 $ 217.0\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 590,090 322,190 180,208\nExpected to vest at September 30, 2024 484,269 278,938 241,864 (1)\n(1) Includes estimated performance achievement\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of the stock options granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the weighted\naverage assumptions noted in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\nOption pricing model Black-Scholes Black-Scholes\nWeighted average grant price $237.10 $185.01\nExpected volatility 23.51 % 27.27 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.89 % 3.77 %\nExpected term in years 3.7 4.0\nDividend yield 0.66 % 0.66 %\nWeighted average grant date fair value per stock option $53.45 $48.05\nThe expected term for the stock options granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected\nexercise behavior. However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was\nestimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a\nmaturity equal to the expected term of the equity award. The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the\nmost recent period commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards. The expected dividend yield was based on\nour expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.\nIntrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the adjusted closing\nprice of our common stock as of the reporting date. Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were recorded as income tax\nbenefit in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of\noptions exercised and restricted stock lapsed in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes. The weighted\naverage remaining contractual terms were 6.0 years and 5.0 years for the outstanding and exercisable stock options, respectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was $88.2 million of total unrecognized compensation costs, exclusive\nof the impact of vesting upon retirement eligibility, related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under our\n2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.\nOur U.K. Sharesave Plan offers qualifying employees in the United Kingdom the opportunity to own shares of our common\nstock. Employees who elect to participate are granted stock options, of which the exercise price is equal to the average of the closing\nprice on the five trading days immediately preceding the plan invitation date discounted by 5%, and enter into a savings contract, the\nproceeds of which are then used to exercise the options upon the three-year maturity of the savings contract. As of September 30,\n2024, there were 442,221 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our U.K. Sharesave Plan.\nOur ESPP offers eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount of its fair market\nvalue at the time of purchase. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we issued 13,139 and 14,698 shares of\ncommon stock at a weighted discounted price of $243.31 and $205.07 for the ESPP, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there\nwere 1,164,119 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our ESPP.\n22\nTable of Contents\n13. Pension and Postretirement Benefits:\nWe maintain a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees through membership in our Pension Plan\nfor Insurance Organizations (the \"Pension Plan\"), a multiple-employer trust. We also apply a cash balance formula to determine future\nbenefits. Under the cash balance formula, each participant has an account, which is credited annually based on the interest earned on\nthe previous year-end cash balance. We also have a frozen non-qualified supplemental cash balance plan (\"SERP\") for certain\nemployees. The SERP is funded from our general assets. During the first quarter of 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, the investment\nguidelines on our Pension Plan assets targeted an investment allocation of 40% to equity securities and 60% to debt securities. We also\nprovide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to certain qualifying active and retired employees. Our Postretirement Health and\nLife Insurance Plan (the \"Postretirement Plan\"), which has been frozen, is contributory, requiring participants to pay a stated\npercentage of the premium for coverage.\nThe components of net periodic (benefit) cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nsummarized below:\nPension Plan and SERP Postretirement Plan\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 3.8 $ 4.4 $ — $ —\nExpected return on plan assets (6.2 ) (6.0 ) — —\nAmortization of prior service cost — 0.1 — —\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 0.8 1.2 0.1 —\nNet periodic (benefit) cost $ (1.6 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 0.1 $ —\nEmployer contributions, net $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2\nPension Plan and SERP Postretirement Plan\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 11.4 $ 13.1 $ 0.1 $ —\nExpected return on plan assets (18.8 ) (18.2 ) (0.1 ) —\nAmortization of prior service cost 0.2 0.2 — —\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 2.5 3.9 0.4 —\nNet periodic (benefit) cost $ (4.7 ) $ (1.0 ) $ 0.4 $ —\nEmployer contributions, net $ 0.5 $ 1.5 $ 0.7 $ 1.0\nThe expected contributions to the Pension Plan, SERP, and Postretirement Plan for the year ending December 31, 2024 are\nconsistent with the amounts previously disclosed as of December 31, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\n14. Segment Reporting:\nASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (“ASC 280-10”), establishes standards for\nreporting information about operating segments. ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive\ninformation about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial\ninformation is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate\nresources and in assessing performance. Our President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") is identified as the CODM as defined by\nASC 280-10.\nEach of the reportable segments, Insurance, and Energy and Specialized Markets, has a portion of its revenue from more than\none of the three revenue types described within our revenue recognition policy. Below is the overview of the solutions offered within\neach reportable segment.\nInsurance: We are the leading provider of statistical, actuarial, and underwriting data for the U.S. P&C insurance industry.\nOur databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and\nproperty risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants, and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities. We use this\ndata to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost\nestimates used to price insurance policies, which are accessed via a hosted platform. We also develop solutions that our customers use\nto analyze key processes in managing risk. Our combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates our proprietary data to\ngenerate solutions. We also help businesses and governments better anticipate and manage climate and weather-related risks. In most\ncases, our customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas, or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss\nevents, ranging from hurricanes to earthquakes. We develop catastrophe and extreme event models and offer solutions covering\nnatural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism. We further develop solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss\nevents occur. Our multitier, multispectral terrestrial imagery and data acquisition, processing, analytics, and distribution system using\nthe remote sensing and machine learning technologies help gather, store, process, and deliver geographic and spatially referenced\ninformation that supports uses in many markets. Additionally, we offer fraud-detection solutions including review of data on claim\nhistories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance sector. Our\nunderwriting, insurance anti-fraud claims, catastrophe modeling, and loss quantification solutions are included in this segment.\nEnergy and Specialized Markets: On February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy segment. We determined that\nthe transaction met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the financial operations of Energy are excluded\nfrom the segment disclosure. See Note 7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion. Prior to the sale, we were a\nleading provider of data analytics via hosted platform for the global energy, chemicals, and metals and mining industries. Our research\nand consulting solutions focused on exploration strategies and screening, asset development and acquisition, commodity markets, and\ncorporate analysis in the areas of business environment, business improvement, business strategies, commercial advisory, and\ntransaction support. We gathered and managed proprietary information, insight, and analysis on oil and gas fields, mines, refineries,\nand other assets across the interconnected global energy sectors to advise customers in making asset investment and portfolio\nallocation decisions. Our analytical tools measured and observed environmental properties and translated those measurements into\nactionable information based on customer needs. In addition, we provided market and cost intelligence to energy companies to\noptimize financial results.\nAs of February 1, 2023, we have determined that we have one operating segment and one reportable segment, Insurance, on\na prospective basis. The segment is based on financial information that is utilized by the Company’s CODM, who is the Company’s\nCEO, to assess performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis. We have included the results of our disposed of segments\nbelow for comparability purposes. We use EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing\noperations. EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and\nintangible assets. EBITDA is the measure of operating results used to assess corporate performance and optimal utilization of debt and\nacquisitions. Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees,\nconsulting, travel, and third-party information services. We do not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since\nthese items are not considered in evaluating the segment’s overall operating performance. In addition, our CODM does not evaluate\nthe financial performance of each segment based on assets. See Note 3. Revenues for information on disaggregated revenues by type\nof service and by country.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide our revenue and EBITDA by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, and the reconciliation of EBITDA to income before income taxes as shown in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nInsurance Total Insurance Total\nRevenues $ 725.3 $ 725.3 677.6 $ 677.6\nExpenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) (223.4 ) (223.4 ) (217.2 ) (217.2 )\nSelling, general and administrative (114.0 ) (114.0 ) (111.6 ) (111.6 )\nInvestment gain (loss) 5.9 5.9 (2.0 ) (2.0 )\nEBITDA $ 393.8 $ 393.8 $ 346.8 $ 346.8\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets (58.1 ) (48.1 )\nAmortization of intangible assets (18.3 ) (19.6 )\nInterest expense (32.1 ) (29.4 )\nIncome before income taxes $ 285.3 $ 249.7\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nInsurance Total Insurance Total\nRevenues $ 2,146.1 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2 $ 2,004.2\nExpenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) (670.6 ) (670.6 ) (650.3 ) (650.3 )\nSelling, general and administrative (308.4 ) (308.4 ) (277.4 ) (277.4 )\nNet gain on the early extinguishment of debt 3.6 3.6 — —\nInvestment gain (loss) 102.4 102.4 (9.3 ) (9.3 )\nEBITDA $ 1,273.1 $ 1,273.1 $ 1,067.2 1,067.2\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets (174.5 ) (139.2 )\nAmortization of intangible assets (55.0 ) (56.1 )\nInterest expense (90.1 ) (87.4 )\nIncome before income taxes $ 953.5 $ 784.5\nLong-lived assets by country are provided below:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLong-lived assets:\nU.S. $ 2,341.9 $ 2,455.7\nU.K. 630.5 597.9\nOther countries 498.2 502.4\nTotal long-lived assets $ 3,470.6 $ 3,556.0\n25\nTable of Contents\n15. Related Parties:\nWe consider our stockholders that own more than 5.0% of the outstanding stock within the class to be related parties as\ndefined within ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no material\ntransactions with related parties owning more than 5.0% of the entire class of stock.\n26\nTable of Contents\n16. Commitments and Contingencies:\nWe are a party to legal proceedings, investigations, examinations, subpoenas, third party requests, government requests,\nregulatory proceedings and other claims with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including the matters\ndescribed below (collectively, “Ongoing Matters”). With respect to Ongoing Matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine\nthe ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to Ongoing Matters or the impact\nthese matters may have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Although we believe we have strong defenses\nand have appealed adverse rulings to us, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nTelematics Litigation\nAs of April 19, 2024, various Plaintiffs filed a total of 20 separate putative class action lawsuits, sixteen against General\nMotors LLC (“GM”), OnStar LLC (“OnStar”), LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc. (“LexisNexis”) and Verisk in the United States\nDistrict Courts for the Northern District of Georgia, the Eastern District of Michigan, Central District of California, District of New\nJersey, Southern District of New York, Northern District of Alabama, Northern District of Illinois and District of South Carolina, and\nfour against Hyundai Motor America (“Hyundai”) and Verisk in the Central District of California and District of New Jersey, three of\nwhich have been dismissed to date. The Complaints generally allege that the auto manufacturer Defendants collected consumers’\ndriver behavior data through vehicle software, transmitted it to LexisNexis and Verisk, and that LexisNexis and Verisk shared the data\nwith auto insurance companies, without the individuals’ knowledge or consent. Plaintiffs seek certification of both nationwide classes\nof individuals and subclasses of various state residents who had their vehicle’s driving data collected by Defendants and shared with a\nthird party without their consent. The Plaintiffs also seek actual, statutory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, as well as\nreasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. On June 7, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all GM-related lawsuits\nto the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (In Re: Consumer Vehicle Driving Data Tracking Litigation, MDL Case\nNo. 1:24-md-03115-TWT). All discovery proceedings have been stayed. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the\nliability related to these matters, as they are still in their early stages.\nIndemnification Claim\nIn December 2023, we received a Notice of Indemnification claim from the current owner of our former healthcare data\nanalytics subsidiary, which was divested in 2016, relating to an ongoing tax investigation by the Nepalese tax authorities. Pursuant to\nthe 2016 sale agreement, we are subject to indemnification obligations with respect to certain pre-closing tax liabilities of the divested\nentity. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as it is still in its early stages.\nCommercial Litigation\nOn February 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, DDS Striker Holdings LLC and Data Driven Holdings LLC against Verisk\nAnalytics, Inc. and Insurance Service Office, in the Superior Court of Delaware, Case No. N24C-02-130 VLM CCLD. Plaintiffs\nallege claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, common\nlaw fraud, and civil conspiracy in connection with their inability to meet the post-closing earn-out targets negotiated as part of our\nacquisition of Data Driven Safety, LLC. Plaintiffs seek rescissory, out-of-pocket and punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees,\ncosts and other expenses. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, which was fully briefed as of June 21, 2024, and was\npartially denied on August 29, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case\nis still in its early stages.\n27\nTable of Contents\nData Privacy Litigation\nOn or about February 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, Atlas Data Privacy Corp., et al. v. Verisk Analytics, Inc., et al., in the\nSuperior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, Case No. MID-L-000903-24, alleging violations of Daniel’s Law. Atlas claims to\nbe an “assignee” of claims of approximately 19,640 individuals who are “covered persons” under Daniel’s Law, allegedly enacted to\nprovide judicial and law enforcement officers and their family members with the right to prevent disclosure of their personal\ninformation and to enforce those rights against uncooperative data brokers. It is alleged that Defendants have violated Daniel’s Law by\nfailing to respond and comply with their written request to Defendants to cease publicly disclosing or re-disclosing their protected\ninformation. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in the amount of $1,000 per violation under the statute, punitive damages, injunctive relief\nordering compliance with Daniel’s Law, permanent injunctive relief, including the appointment of a qualified independent expert to\nensure compliance with Daniel’s Law, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. On June 21, 2024, the court issued a “lack of\nprosecution” warning to Atlas, advising that the case will be dismissed without prejudice if service is not effectuated by August 20,\n2024. The case was dismissed without prejudice on August 26, 2024. On October 11, 2024, Plaintiffs served Verisk with the\nSummons and Complaint, indicating their intent to revise the lawsuit. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability\nrelated to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\nOn January 30, 2023, Plaintiffs Justin Ahringer and Michael Donner filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States\nDistrict Court, Central District of California, titled Ahringer et al. v. LoanDepot, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya,\nCase No.: 8:23-cv-00186. Plaintiffs assert violations of California’s Invasion of Privacy Act, Unfair Competition Law, and a violation\nof class members’ privacy rights under the California Constitution. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants recorded visitors’ electronic\ncommunications without their consent. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of individuals who visited LoanDepot.com and\nprovided personal information on the website’s forms to receive a quote or apply for a loan. They allege that the aggregate claims of\nall members of the proposed class exceeds $5.0 million. Plaintiffs seek compensatory, statutory or punitive damages or restitution, as\nwell as reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims on April 13, 2023. The parties\nengaged in jurisdictional discovery in response to the court’s demand to Plaintiff to demonstrate why this case should not be dismissed\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found jurisdiction is proper and partially denied our motion on February 7, 2024. We\nfiled our Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint on February 22, 2024. The parties have agreed to a settlement in principle.\nOn June 27, 2022, Plaintiff Loretta Williams brought a putative class action against Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya\n(“we,” “our,” or “us”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Williams v. DDR Media, LLC\nand Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-03789. The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code 631 (“CIPA”) and invaded Plaintiff’s and class members’ privacy rights when\nDefendants purportedly recorded visitors’ visits to the scrappyrent2own.com website without prior express consent. It is further\nalleged that this conduct constitutes a violation of the California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code Section 17200 et\nseq. and the California Constitution. The Complaint seeks class certification, injunctive relief, statutory damages in the amount of\n$5,000 for each violation, attorneys fees and other litigation costs. Our motion to compel arbitration was fully briefed as of January\n27, 2023. It was denied on February 28, 2023. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on April 13, 2023. On August 18,\n2023 the court granted our motion, dismissing Plaintiff’s claims without prejudice, but giving Plaintiff an opportunity to amend her\nclaims by September 20, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on September 20, 2023. Our motion to dismiss\nthe SAC was fully briefed on December 18, 2023. It was denied on January 30, 2024. The court held an initial case management\nconference for February 9, 2024 and allowed the parties to engage in limited discovery. Our renewed motion to dismiss was filed on\nJuly 19, 2024 and oral argument was held on September 20, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability\nrelated to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\nOn December 15, 2021, Plaintiff Jillian Cantinieri brought a putative class action against Verisk Analytics, Insurance\nServices Office and ISO Claims Services, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York, titled Cantinieri v. Verisk Analytics Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 2:21-cv-6911. The Complaint alleges that we failed to\nsafeguard the personally identifiable information (PII) of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed classes from a purported breach of\nour databases by unauthorized entities. Plaintiff and class members allege actual and imminent injuries, including theft of their PII,\nfraudulent activity on their financial accounts, lowered credit scores, and costs associated with detection and prevention of identity\ntheft and fraud. They seek to recover compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, disgorgement of earnings and profits, and\nattorney’s fees and costs. We filed our motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on April 22, 2022. On March 30, 2023, the court denied\nour motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing us an opportunity to re-file the motion once limited jurisdictional discovery has\nbeen completed. Our renewed motion to dismiss was fully briefed on February 16, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to\nreasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes\nincluded in our annual report on Form 10-K (\"2023 10-K\") dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on\nFebruary 21, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including\nbut not limited to those listed under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" in our 2023 Form 10-\nK and those listed under Item 1A in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are a leading data analytics provider serving clients in the insurance markets. Using advanced technologies to collect and\nanalyze billions of records, we draw on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide innovations that may be integrated\ninto client workflows. We offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to clients in rating, underwriting, claims,\ncatastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, and many other fields. In the U.S., and around the world, we help clients protect\npeople, property, and financial assets.\nOur clients use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline. We\nrefer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our clients\nto purchase components or the comprehensive package. These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models, or\ntailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. We believe our solutions for analyzing risk\npositively impact our clients’ revenues and help them better manage their costs.\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business. The Energy business was classified as discontinued\noperations per the guidance in ASC 205-20 in the fourth quarter of 2022, as we determined that this transaction represented a strategic\nshift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed\nfrom continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and assets and\nliabilities held for sale for all periods presented. See Note 7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion.\n29\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nKey Performance Metrics\nRevenue growth. We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on\nour ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or\nexpanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.\nWe use year-over-year EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-\nGAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation\nand amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective\nnearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income,\nnet income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in\nconjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We\nbelieve these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater\ntransparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in\nthe use of EBITDA are:\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to\nbe replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nEBITDA growth. We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost\nmanagement and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance\nand facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nEBITDA margin. We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our\nbusiness. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.\nRevenues\nWe earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions,\nrecurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in\nfull upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. As a result,\nthe timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be\nhigher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our\ncustomers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the\nsubscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 81% and 80% of our insurance revenues were derived from hosted subscriptions through\nagreements (generally one to five years) for our solutions, respectively.\nWe also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their\nsubscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring.\nFor example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a\npolicy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or\nuse our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\napproximately 19% and 20% of our insurance revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions,\nrespectively.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nPersonnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPersonnel expenses, which represented approximately 57% and 59% of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to\ndispositions) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation,\nequity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.\nWe assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense,\nbased on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues,\nand all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources,\nand administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as\nfacilities and communications, is also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses based on\nthe nature of the work being performed.\nWhile we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the\neconomies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically,\nour EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in\nexpenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin\nexpansion.\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses\nassociated with the acquisition, disposition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development\nand enhancement of our next-generation solutions.

See Note 11. of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this interim report\non Form 10-Q.\n(2) EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. \"EBITDA\" is defined as\nnet income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible\nassets. See Note 14. of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nAlthough EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in\ntheir evaluation of companies. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a\nsubstitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flows from operating activities reported under GAAP.\nManagement uses EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of\ncompany performance. Some of these limitations are:\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments;\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have\nto be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\n33\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues\nRevenues for our Insurance segment were $725.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$677.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $47.7 million or 7.0%.

Our underwriting revenue increased $31.8 million\nor 6.7%, primarily due to an annual increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the models and content of the solutions\nwithin our forms, rules and loss cost services, as well as selling expanded solutions to new and existing customers within extreme\nevent solutions. In addition, specialty business and life solutions contributed to the growth. Our claims revenue\nincreased $15.3 million or 7.6%, primarily due to solid growth in anti-fraud solutions and property estimating solutions.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues was $223.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $217.2 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $6.2 million or 2.9%. Our recent acquisition accounted for an increase of\n$0.4 million in cost of revenues. The remaining increase of $5.8 million or 2.7% was primarily due to increase in salaries and\nemployee benefits of $5.1 million, professional consulting fees of $4.0 million, information technology expenses of $2.8 million,\ntravel expenses of $0.6 million, and bad debt expense of $0.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in data costs of $2.5\nmillion, $1.5 million gain primarily related to our Jersey City lease modification, office expense of $0.6 million, and other operating\ncosts of $2.4 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $114.0 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $111.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $2.4 million or 2.2%. Our recent\nacquisition accounted for an increase of $0.3 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The remaining increase of\n$2.1 million or 2.0% was primarily due to professional consulting fees of $8.1 million, a $6.9 million loss on the disposal of assets\nprimarily due to a write-off of leasehold improvements related to our lease modification, salaries and employee benefits of $3.0\nmillion, data costs of $1.5 million, travel expenses of $1.0 million, rent expense of $0.8 million, bad debt expense of $0.5 million, and\nother operating costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by a prior year litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million related to our former\nFinancial Services segment, and a decrease in information technology expenses of $0.9 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets were $58.1 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $48.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $10.0 million or 20.8%.

The effective tax\nrate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30,\n2023 primarily due to nondeductible litigation accruals recorded in the prior period. The difference between statutory tax rates and our\neffective tax rate is primarily due to state and local taxes, partially offset by tax benefits attributable to equity compensation.\nNet Income Margin\nThe net income margin was 30.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.7% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

Our recent\nacquisitions, inclusive of our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), accounted for an increase of $20.8 million in selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses. This increase was primarily due to our earn-out credit of $22.0 million in the prior year that did not recur in\nthe current period. The remaining increase of $10.2 million or 3.5% was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of\n$10.1 million, salaries and employee benefits of $9.9 million, a loss of $6.9 million primarily due to the disposal of certain leasehold\nimprovements related to our lease modification, increases in insurance costs of $1.7 million, data costs of $1.4 million, and travel\nexpenses of $1.0 million, partially offset by a prior year litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million related to our former Financial\nServices segment, decreases in fees and membership costs of $1.2 million, and other operating costs of $0.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets were $174.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $139.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $35.3 million or 25.4%.

The effective tax rate for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax\nbenefits resulting from the Company's recognition of capital gains arising from the settlement of our investment in non-public\ncompanies in the second quarter. The difference between statutory tax rates and our effective tax rate is primarily due to state and\nlocal taxes, partially offset by tax benefits attributable to equity compensation.\nNet Income Margin\nThe net income margin was 34.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.0% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and\npresented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. On February 1, 2023, we\ncompleted the sale of our Energy business.\nAs a result of these sale transactions, we have excluded the Energy and Specialized Markets from our management's\ndiscussion and analysis of the results of operations by segment.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities\ntotaling $459.2 million and $303.9 million, respectively. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in higher credit quality financial\ninstitutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a vast majority of our\ndomestic cash and cash equivalents is with TD Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase N.A. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and\ngenerally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is\nusually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated\nsignificant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Credit Facility, we\nexpect that we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans.\nWe have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer\nour solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or\nannually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and\ncash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is\ndeferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the\nservices. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash\nas a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of\ncash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.\nWe have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased $750.0 million (inclusive of $60.0 million in treasury stock not yet\nsettled) and $2,549.8 million (inclusive of $500.0 million in treasury stock then not yet settled), respectively, of our common stock.\nThe repurchase of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 was funded using cash from operations. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, we also paid dividends of $166.6 million and $147.9 million, respectively.\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\nWe had total debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs\nof $3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and we were in compliance\nwith our financial and other covenants. The debt at September 30, 2024, primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2024, 2023, 2020,\n2019, and 2015. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\nwere recorded as \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in\nthe accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-Q over the life of the respective senior note. The\nindenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback\ntransactions, and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into,\nany other person or entity. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations,\nwhich may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any\nsuch repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or\notherwise. See Note 10. for additional information on our financing activities.\nWe have a $1,000.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP\nMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs\nBank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an\ninterest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the\nend of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0. At our election, the maximum\nconsolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more\nthan once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition.

The increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit.\nDividend\nOn September 30, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the\nholders of record as of September 15, 2024.\nOn October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued\nand outstanding. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024, to holders of record as of December 13, 2024.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we initiated a $400 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, which was\ncompleted on October 25, 2024 and resulted in a repurchase of 1,515,616 shares at an average price of $263.92. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $892 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\n2024 Financial Guidance\n5\nThe Company's financial outlook for 2024 remains unchanged and is as follows:\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nLow High\nRevenue $ 2,840 $ 2,900\nAdjusted EBITDA 1,540 1,600\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 54.0% 55.0%\nDiluted adjusted EPS $ 6.30 $ 6.60\nFixed asset depreciation & amortization 210 240\nIntangible amortization 75 75\nEffective tax rate 23.0% 25.0%\nCapital expenditures 240 260\nConference Call\nOur management team will host a live audio webcast to discuss the financial results and business highlights on\nWednesday, October 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. EDT (5:30 a.m. PDT, 12:30 p.m. GMT).

These\nstatements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties,\nand other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially\ndifferent from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-\nlooking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common\nstock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings,\nfinancial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and\nuncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the\nnegative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking\nstatements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases,\nbeyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in\nour quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions\nprove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this\nrelease reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to\npublicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future\n7\nevents, or otherwise except as required by law.\nNotes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP\nmeasures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful\ninformation to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial\nresults, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i)\ndepreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv)\nprovision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-\nouts), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA\nexpenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because\nthey help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating\nperformance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i)\namortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from\ndispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted\nadjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures\nare useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax\neffect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.\nFree Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with\nGAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash\ngenerated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth\nthrough new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\nOrganic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which\ninclude businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity-method\ninvestments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar\nquarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its\ncurrent-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic\ngrowth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar\n8\nquarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a\ndisposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also\nexcluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the\nbusiness without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent\ndispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and\nadjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the\nunderlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\nwe present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results\nat the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and\nmeaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to\nfacilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate\nmovements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\nSee page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted\nEBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and\na reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to\nfree cash flow.\nWe are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted\nEPS to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability\nof estimating certain items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted\nAdjusted EPS, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other\nnon-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAttached Financial Statements\nPlease refer to the full Form 10-Q filing for the complete financial statements and related notes.\nVERISK ANALYTICS,

Organization:\nVerisk Analytics, Inc. ('Company') is a strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry. We\nempower clients to strengthen operating efficiency, improve underwriting and claims outcomes, combat fraud and make informed\ndecisions about global risks, including climate change, extreme events, sustainability, and political issues.

We trade under the ticker symbol \"VRSK\" on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nOur accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting\nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting periods. Significant estimates include acquisition purchase price allocations, the fair value of goodwill and\nintangibles, the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities, acquisition-related liabilities, fair value of stock-based compensation\nfor stock options and performance share units granted, and assets and liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results\nmay ultimately differ from those estimates.\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, to present\nfairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our operating results for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared on the same basis\nas and should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain information\nand footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or\nomitted pursuant to the rules of the SEC. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to keep the information presented from being\nmisleading.\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business. We determined that the sale of our Energy business met\nthe “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 205-20, Discontinued Operations (“ASC 205-20”) due to its relative size and strategic rationale. The\nconsolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements were\nrecast for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the Energy business, in accordance with ASC 205-20.

Revenues:\nDisaggregated revenues by type of service and by country are provided below for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023. No individual customer or country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10.0% or more of our consolidated revenues\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInsurance:\nUnderwriting $ 506.9 $ 475.2 $ 1,512.8 $ 1,413.7\nClaims 218.4 202.4 633.3 590.5\nTotal revenues $ 725.3 $ 677.6 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nUnited States $ 604.1 $ 564.9 $ 1,778.8 $ 1,680.1\nUnited Kingdom 53.3 48.5 156.2 140.4\nOther countries 67.9 64.2 211.1 183.7\nTotal revenues $ 725.3 $ 677.6 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2\n8\nTable of Contents\nContract assets are defined as an entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has\ntransferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had no contract assets. Contract liabilities are defined as an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to\na customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. As of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had contract liabilities that primarily related to unsatisfied performance obligations to provide\ncustomers with the right to use and update the online content over the remaining contract term of $502.0 million and $375.1 million,\nrespectively. Contract liabilities, which are current and noncurrent, are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other noncurrent\nliabilities\" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of the change in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024:\nContract liabilities at December 31, 2023 $ 375.1\nAdditions to contract liabilities 2,274.7\nRevenue (2,146.1 )\nForeign currency translation adjustment (1.7 )\nContract liabilities at September 30, 2024 $ 502.0\nOur most significant remaining performance obligations relate to providing customers with the right to use and update\nthe online content over the remaining contract term. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on\nthe requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting\nthe timing of satisfying the performance obligations. These performance obligations, which are expected to be satisfied within one\nyear, comprised approximately 99% of the balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWe recognize an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefits of those costs to\nbe longer than one year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had deferred commissions of $76.8 million and\n$76.4 million, respectively, which have been included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Other noncurrent assets\" in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\n9\nTable of Contents\n4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements:\nWe have certain assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. To increase consistency and comparability of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, ASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurements, established a three-level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nASC 820-10 requires disclosures detailing the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the methods and\nassumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we\napplied the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 - Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments.\nLevel 2 - Assets or liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.\nLevel 3 - Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market; instruments\nvalued based on the best available data, some of which are internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that\nmarket participants would require.'\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term\ndebt approximate their carrying amounts, because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Our investments in registered\ninvestment companies, which are Level 1 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, was $1.2 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. Our investments in registered investment companies are valued using quoted prices in active markets\nmultiplied by the number of shares owned and were included in \"Other current assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWe elected not to carry our long-term debt at fair value. The carrying value of the long-term debt represents amortized cost,\ninclusive of unamortized premium, and net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. We assess the fair value of these financial\ninstruments based on an estimate of interest rates available to us for financial instruments with similar features, our current credit\nrating, and spreads applicable to us. The following table summarizes the carrying value and estimated fair value of these financial\ninstruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair Value Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated\nHierarchy Value Fair Value Value Fair Value\nFinancial instruments not carried at fair value:\nSenior notes (Note 10) Level 2 $ 3,020.4 $ 2,986.1 $ 2,833.7 $ 2,735.3\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had securities without readily determinable market values of $196.4\nmillion and $200.9 million, respectively, which were accounted for at cost. We do not have the ability to exercise significant influence\nover the investees’ operating and financial policies and do not hold investments in common stock or in-substance common stock in\nsuch entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had investments in private companies of $26.4 million and\n$30.5 million, respectively, accounted for in accordance with ASC 323-10-25, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in\nCommon Stock (\"ASC 323-10-25\"), as equity method investments. All such investments were included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" in\nour accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no\nprovision for credit losses related to these investments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we settled retained interests in non-\npublic companies associated with previously disposed businesses and received proceeds of $112.1 million, resulting in a net gain\nof $98.3 million. The net gain was included in \"Investment gain (loss)\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\n10\nTable of Contents\n5. Leases:\nWe have operating and finance leases for corporate offices, data centers, and certain equipment that are accounted for under\nASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\").\nThe following table presents the consolidated lease cost and cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities for finance and operating leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost (1) $ 8.3 $ 8.2 $ 25.0 $ 25.6\nSublease income (1.1 ) (0.3 ) (3.2 ) (1.0 )\nFinance lease costs:\nDepreciation of finance lease assets (2) 5.0 3.8 14.3 10.6\nInterest on finance lease liabilities (3) 0.5 0.4 1.7 0.7\nTotal lease cost $ 12.7 $ 12.1 $ 37.8 $ 35.9\nOther information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ (9.0 ) $ (8.2 ) $ (25.6 ) $ (25.9 )\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases $ (0.5 ) $ (0.4 ) $ (1.7 ) $ (0.7 )\nFinancing cash outflows from finance leases $ (13.0 ) $ (10.4 ) $ (18.9 ) $ (13.2 )\n_______________\n(1) Included in \"Cost of revenues\" and \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations\n(2) Included in \"Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations\n(3) Included in \"Interest expense\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations\nThe following table presents weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for the\nconsolidated finance and operating leases as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases (in years) 7.2 8.4\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases (in years) 3.3 3.4\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 4.1 % 3.9 %\nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases 4.2 % 4.1 %\nOur right-of-use ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for finance leases were $52.8 million and $44.0 million, respectively, as\nof September 30, 2024. Our ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases were $41.2 million and $34.5 million, respectively, as\nof December 31, 2023. Our ROU assets for finance leases were included in \"Fixed assets, net\" in our accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our lease liabilities for finance leases were included in the \"Short-term debt and current portion of long-\nterm debt\" and \"Long-term debt\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10. Debt).\nOn August 16, 2024, we early vacated two floors within our Jersey City office. This transaction was accounted for as a lease\nmodification in accordance with ASC 842. As a result of the lease modification, we reassessed the accounting for the Jersey City\nlease, resulting in a reduction of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $11.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively, and recognition of a\ngain of $1.9 million. Additionally, we recorded an impairment of $7.6 million of the remaining net book value of leasehold\nimprovements.\nMaturities of lease liabilities for the remainder of 2024 and the years through 2029 and thereafter are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nYears Ending Operating Leases Finance Leases\n2024 $ 8.4 $ 4.3\n2025 33.6 21.5\n2026 31.7 10.7\n2027 31.3 8.9\n2028 29.8 4.3\n2029 and thereafter 91.4 —\nTotal lease payments 226.2 49.7\nLess: amount representing interest (30.7 ) (5.7 )\nPresent value of total lease payments $ 195.5 $ 44.0\n11\nTable of Contents\n6. Acquisitions:\n2024 Acquisitions\nOn January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH (\"Rocket\") for a net\ncash purchase price of $10.1 million, of which $2.2 million represents a deferred payment and $0.3 million represents a holdback\npayment. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill as we did not incur any material liabilities. Rocket’s strong\nproperty claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across\nGermany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by\nVerisk in Rocket in 2022, will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company’s goal of helping insurers and claims service\nproviders leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred transaction costs of $0.2 million and $0.3 million,\nrespectively. The transaction costs were included within \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. The 2024 acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated statement of\noperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore, supplemental information disclosure on\nan unaudited pro forma basis is not presented.\nAcquisition Escrows and Related Liabilities\nPursuant to the related acquisition agreements, we have funded various escrow accounts to satisfy pre-acquisition indemnity\nand tax claims arising subsequent to the applicable acquisition dates. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the current\nportion of the escrows amounted to $0.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. There were no noncurrent portions of the escrows. The\ncurrent portion of the escrows have been included in \"Other current assets\" in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the acquisition of Krug Sachverständigen GmbH ('Krug'), Mavera Holding AB ('Mavera'), and\nMorning Data Limited ('Morning Data') included acquisition-related contingent payments, for which the sellers of these acquisitions\ncould receive additional payments by achieving the specific predetermined revenue, EBITDA, and/or EBITDA margin earn-out\ntargets for exceptional performance. We believe that the liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflect\nthe best estimate of acquisition-related contingent payments. The associated current portion of the contingent payments were $0.0\nmillion and $10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The associated noncurrent portion of\ncontingent payments was $2.2 million and $2.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n12\nTable of Contents\n7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations:\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business to Planet Jersey Buyer Ltd, an entity that was formed on\nbehalf of, and is controlled by, The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and its affiliated funds and entities (“Veritas Capital”), for a net\ncash sale price of $3,066.4 million paid at closing (reflecting a base purchase price of $3,100.0 million, subject to customary purchase\nprice adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital, and indebtedness of the companies as of the closing) and up to\n$200.0 million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital’s future return on its investment paid\nthrough a Class C Partnership interest.\nThe Energy business, which was part of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was classified as discontinued\noperations per ASC 205-20 as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represented a strategic shift that\nhad a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from\ncontinuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.\nAdditionally, all assets and liabilities of the Energy business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the held for sale classification, we recognized an impairment\nof $303.7 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our\nconsolidated statement of operations. Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment within shareholders’ equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment.\nWhen we closed on the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we recognized a loss of $128.4 million. As a result of closing\nadjustments in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred an additional net loss of $2.7 million.\nThe following table presents the financial results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our consolidated\nstatement of income for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ — $ — $ — $ 46.8\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) — — — 18.2\nSelling, general and administrative — — — 33.1\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets — — — —\nAmortization of intangible assets — — — —\nOther operating loss, net — — — 135.3\nTotal operating expenses — — — 186.6\nOperating loss — — — (139.8 )\nOther expense:\nInvestment loss and others, net — — — (5.5 )\nLoss from discontinued operations before income taxes — — — (145.3 )\nIncome tax expense — — — (0.2 )\nLoss from discontinued operations $ — $ — $ — $ (145.5 )\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows have not been adjusted to separately disclose cash flows related to discontinued\noperations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:\nThe following is a summary of the change in goodwill from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024, for our\nInsurance operating segment:\nInsurance\nGoodwill at December 31, 2023 $ 1,760.8\nAcquisitions(1) 10.6\nPurchase accounting reclassifications 0.3\nForeign currency translation adjustment 21.1\nGoodwill at September 30, 2024 $ 1,792.8\n_______________\n(1) See Note 6. Acquisitions for more information.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for\nimpairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or “Step Zero” impairment test, to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and\nmarket considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do\nnot perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amounts of our reporting units\nexceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If\nthe carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As\nof June 30, 2024, we completed our step zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was not more likely than not\nthat the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did not recognize any additional impairment charges\nrelated to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to\nmonitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did not identify any such events.\nImpairments to long lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $7.6 million. There were no\nimpairments to long lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During August 2024, we early vacated two\nfloors at our Jersey City, New Jersey, corporate headquarters. As a result, we assessed the related long-lived assets at the site\nfor impairment and recognized $7.6 million of impairment charges, primarily related to the write-off the remaining net book value\nof leasehold improvements.\nOur intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of the following:\nWeighted\nAverage Useful Accumulated\nLife (in years) Cost Amortization Net\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTechnology-based 8 $ 375.0 $ (286.2 ) $ 88.8\nMarketing-related 6 43.6 (40.8 ) 2.8\nContract-based 6 5.0 (5.0 ) —\nCustomer-related 13 549.4 (224.3 ) 325.1\nDatabase-based 8 15.4 (9.5 ) 5.9\nTotal intangible assets $ 988.4 $ (565.8 ) $ 422.6\nDecember 31, 2023\nTechnology-based 8 $ 370.2 $ (261.2 ) $ 109.0\nMarketing-related 6 42.7 (38.7 ) 4.0\nContract-based 6 5.0 (5.0 ) —\nCustomer-related 13 542.1 (190.7 ) 351.4\nDatabase-based 8 15.2 (7.9 ) 7.3\nTotal intangible assets $ 975.2 $ (503.5 ) $ 471.7\n14\nTable of Contents\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.3 million\nand $19.6 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 was $55.0 million and $56.1 million, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the remainder of 2024 and the years\nthrough 2029 and thereafter for intangible assets subject to amortization is as follows:\nYears Ending Amount\n2024 $ 17.5\n2025 63.6\n2026 61.7\n2027 53.4\n2028 46.2\n2029 and thereafter 180.2\nTotal $ 422.6\n15\nTable of Contents\n9. Income Taxes:\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.9% and 21.6% compared to the\neffective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 25.0% and 25.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to nondeductible litigation accruals recorded in the prior period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to tax charges\nincurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax benefits resulting from the Company's\nrecognition of capital gains arising from the settlement of our investment in non-public companies in the second\nquarter. The difference between statutory tax rates and our effective tax rate is primarily due to state and local taxes, partially offset\nby tax benefits attributable to equity compensation.\nA number of jurisdictions have begun to enact legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment’s 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes do not have a material impact on\nour condensed consolidated financial statements.\n16\nTable of Contents\n10.

Leases\nSenior Notes\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of\n$3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million outstanding, respectively, and were in compliance with our financial and other covenants.\nOn June 5, 2024, we completed an issuance of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due\n2034 (the \"2034 Senior Notes\"). The 2034 Senior Notes will mature on June 5, 2034 and accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per\nannum. Interest is payable semiannually on June 5th and December 5th of each year, beginning December 5th,\n2024. The 2034 Senior Notes were issued at a discount of $9.8 million and we incurred debt issuance costs of $5.6 million. The\noriginal issuance discount and debt issuance costs were recorded in \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets and these costs will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over\nthe life of the 2034 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Senior Notes were utilized partially for the tender\noffer of 4.00% senior notes due in 2025 (\"2025 Senior Notes\") and general corporate purposes. The indenture governing\nthe 2034 Senior Notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and\nconsolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person\nor entity.\nOn June 7, 2024, we completed a cash tender offer for $400.0 million, or 44.4%, of the aggregate principal amount of the\n2025 Senior Notes. The consideration offered for each $1,000.0 principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes was $987.09 (the\n\"Purchase Price\"). Net cash proceeds of the 2034 Senior Notes were used to pay the Purchase Price, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest. This reduced the outstanding balance to $500.0 million. We recognized a $3.6 million net gain on debt extinguishment\ncomprised of $5.2 million for the discount paid below par, partially offset by $1.6 million of costs charged to expense on early debt\nmodification, which were recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nCredit Facilities\nWe have a syndicated revolving credit facility (\"Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility\") with a borrowing capacity of\n$1,000.0 million with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National\nAssociation, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust\nCompany. The Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and\ncapital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"). As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under our Syndicated Revolving Credit\nFacility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was\n$995.5 million and $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.5 million and $4.6 million,\nrespectively.\n17\nTable of Contents\n11. Stockholders’ Equity:\nWe have 2,000,000,000 shares of authorized common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our common\nshares have rights to any dividend declared by the board of directors (the \"Board\"), subject to any preferential or other rights of any\noutstanding preferred stock, and voting rights to elect all current members of the Board. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the adjusted closing price of our common stock was $267.96 and $238.86 per share, respectively.\nWe have 80,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The preferred shares have preferential\nrights over the common shares with respect to dividends and net distribution upon liquidation. We did not issue any preferred shares\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOn February 14, 2024, April 24, 2024, and July 24, 2024, our Board approved a cash dividend of $0.39 per share of common\nstock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of March 15, 2024, June 15, 2024, and September 15, 2024, respectively. Cash\ndividends of $166.6 million and $147.9 million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.\nOn October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and\noutstanding. The dividend is payable on December 31, 2024, to holders of record as of December 13, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn December 2023, March 2024, and June 2024, we entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements (the\n\"December 2023 ASR Agreement\", \"March 2024 ASR Agreement\", and \"June 2024 ASR Agreement\") to repurchase shares of\nour common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million, $200.0 million, and $150.0 million, with Goldman Sachs & Co.\nLLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Citibank, N.A, respectively. All ASR agreements are accounted for as a treasury stock\ntransaction and forward stock purchase agreement indexed to our common stock. The forward stock purchase agreements\nare classified as equity instruments under ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (\"ASC 815-40\") and deemed to have a fair\nvalue of zero at the respective effective date. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to stockholder's equity in our\ncondensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholder's equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon payment\nof the aggregate purchase price on December 14, 2023, March 13, 2024, and June 13, 2024, we received initial deliveries of\n873,479, 714,046, and 483,761 shares of our common stock, respectively. Upon the final settlement of the December 2023 ASR\nAgreement, the March 2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement, in February 2024, April 2024, and July 2024, we\nreceived 178,227, 148,286, and 68,645 additional shares as determined based on the volume weighted average share price of our\ncommon stock, less a discount, of $237.71, $231.93, and $271.54 during the term of the December 2023 ASR Agreement, the March\n2024 ASR Agreement, and the June 2024 ASR Agreement, respectively. These repurchases for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and\ndiluted earnings per share (\"EPS\").\nIn August 2024, we entered into an additional ASR agreement (the \"August 2024 ASR Agreement\") to repurchase shares of\nour common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. Upon payment of the aggregate\npurchase price on August 7, 2024, we received an initial delivery of 1,302,981 shares of our common stock. The initial share\ndelivery reduced our outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS.\nUpon the final settlement of the August 2024 ASR Agreement in October 2024, we received 212,635 additional shares, as determined\nbased on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock, less a discount, of $263.92 during the term of the August\n2024 ASR Agreement.\nWe utilized cash received from operations for these repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, we had $891.5 million available\non our authorization to repurchase shares.\nThrough the third quarter of 2024, we recorded total excise tax of $30.0 million, which has been included within treasury\nstock, as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased, and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTreasury Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, our treasury stock consisted of 402,606,293 shares of common stock, carried at cost. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we transferred 983,962 shares of common stock from the treasury shares at a weighted\naverage treasury stock price of $23.25 per share.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Verisk by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator\nis increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding, using the treasury stock method, if\nthe dilutive potential common shares, including vested and nonvested stock options, nonvested restricted stock awards, nonvested\nrestricted stock units, nonvested performance share units (\"PSU\"), and nonvested deferred stock units, had been issued.\nThe following is a presentation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator used in basic and diluted

Employees, non-employee directors, and\nconsultants are eligible for awards under our 2021 Incentive Plan. We transferred common stock under these plans from our treasury\nshares. As of September 30, 2024, there were 12,811,487 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our\n2021 Incentive Plan. Cash received from stock option exercises for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 was $110.6 million and $134.3 million, respectively.\nWe grant equity awards to our key employees. The nonqualified stock options have an exercise price equal to the adjusted\nclosing price of our common stock on the grant date, with a ten-year contractual term. The fair value of the restricted stock is\ndetermined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock is not assignable or transferable until it\nbecomes vested. PSUs vest at the end of a three-year performance period, subject to the recipient’s continued service. Each PSU\nrepresents the right to receive one share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain\nmarket and financial performance criteria and may range from 0% to 200% of the recipient’s target levels of 100% established on the\ngrant date. The fair value of PSUs based on market conditions is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation\nmodel. The fair value of PSUs based on financial performance conditions is determined using the closing price of our common stock\non the grant date. We recognize the expense of the equity awards ratably over the vesting period, which could be up to four years.\nIn January 2024, we granted 199,776 nonqualified stock options, 129,789 shares of restricted stock, and 47,838 PSUs to key\nemployees. The nonqualified stock options and restricted stock have a graded service vesting period of four years. The PSUs granted\nconsisted of 29,929 PSUs that are based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return as compared to the companies that\ncomprise the S&P 500 index (\"TSR-based PSUs\") and 17,909 PSUs that are tied to the achievement of certain financial performance\nconditions, namely incremental return on invested capital (“ROIC-based PSUs”). Each of the TSR-based PSUs and ROIC-based PSUs\nhave a three-year performance period, subject to the recipients' continued service. The grant date fair value of the ROIC-based PSUs is\ndetermined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The related performance condition is driven by the\nincremental return on invested capital based on net operating profit. The ultimate realization of the PSUs may range from 0% to 200%\nof the recipient’s target levels established on the grant date.\nA summary of the status of the stock options, restricted stock, and PSUs awarded under our 2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans as\nof December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 and changes during the interim period are presented below:\nStock Option Restricted Stock PSU\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nWeighted Grant Grant\nAverage Aggregate Date Fair Date Fair\nNumber of Exercise Intrinsic Number of Value Per Number of Value Per\nShares Price Value Shares Share Shares Share\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 2,712,510 $ 143.91 $ 257.6 291,039 $ 186.28 181,236 $ 199.62\nGranted 203,884 $ 237.10 151,242 $ 237.11 47,838 $ 265.94\nDividend reinvestment — $ — — $ — 825 N/A\nExercised or lapsed (873,272 ) $ 126.50 $ 110.0 (104,359 ) $ 187.80 (47,821 ) $ 210.07\nCanceled, expired or forfeited (24,530 ) $ 202.41 (15,732 ) $ 206.87 (1,870 ) $ 210.07\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 2,018,592 $ 160.13 $ 217.7 322,190 $ 208.87 180,208 $ 205.10\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 1,428,502 $ 141.31 $ 180.9\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 1,947,253 $ 127.43 $ 217.0\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 590,090 322,190 180,208\nExpected to vest at September 30, 2024 484,269 278,938 241,864 (1)\n(1) Includes estimated performance achievement\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of the stock options granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the weighted\naverage assumptions noted in the following table for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\nOption pricing model Black-Scholes Black-Scholes\nWeighted average grant price $237.10 $185.01\nExpected volatility 23.51 % 27.27 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.89 % 3.77 %\nExpected term in years 3.7 4.0\nDividend yield 0.66 % 0.66 %\nWeighted average grant date fair value per stock option $53.45 $48.05\nThe expected term for the stock options granted was estimated based on studies of historical experience and projected\nexercise behavior. However, for certain awards granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exists, the expected term was\nestimated using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a\nmaturity equal to the expected term of the equity award. The volatility factor is calculated using historical daily closing prices over the\nmost recent period commensurate with the expected term of the stock option awards. The expected dividend yield was based on\nour expected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.\nIntrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the adjusted closing\nprice of our common stock as of the reporting date. Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were recorded as income tax\nbenefit in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of the intrinsic value of\noptions exercised and restricted stock lapsed in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes. The weighted\naverage remaining contractual terms were 6.0 years and 5.0 years for the outstanding and exercisable stock options, respectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was $88.2 million of total unrecognized compensation costs, exclusive\nof the impact of vesting upon retirement eligibility, related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under our\n2021 and 2013 Incentive Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.\nOur U.K. Sharesave Plan offers qualifying employees in the United Kingdom the opportunity to own shares of our common\nstock. Employees who elect to participate are granted stock options, of which the exercise price is equal to the average of the closing\nprice on the five trading days immediately preceding the plan invitation date discounted by 5%, and enter into a savings contract, the\nproceeds of which are then used to exercise the options upon the three-year maturity of the savings contract. As of September 30,\n2024, there were 442,221 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our U.K. Sharesave Plan.\nOur ESPP offers eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount of its fair market\nvalue at the time of purchase. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we issued 13,139 and 14,698 shares of\ncommon stock at a weighted discounted price of $243.31 and $205.07 for the ESPP, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there\nwere 1,164,119 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance under our ESPP.\n22\nTable of Contents\n13. Pension and Postretirement Benefits:\nWe maintain a frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees through membership in our Pension Plan\nfor Insurance Organizations (the \"Pension Plan\"), a multiple-employer trust. We also apply a cash balance formula to determine future\nbenefits. Under the cash balance formula, each participant has an account, which is credited annually based on the interest earned on\nthe previous year-end cash balance. We also have a frozen non-qualified supplemental cash balance plan (\"SERP\") for certain\nemployees. The SERP is funded from our general assets. During the first quarter of 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, the investment\nguidelines on our Pension Plan assets targeted an investment allocation of 40% to equity securities and 60% to debt securities. We also\nprovide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to certain qualifying active and retired employees. Our Postretirement Health and\nLife Insurance Plan (the \"Postretirement Plan\"), which has been frozen, is contributory, requiring participants to pay a stated\npercentage of the premium for coverage.\nThe components of net periodic (benefit) cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nsummarized below:\nPension Plan and SERP Postretirement Plan\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 3.8 $ 4.4 $ — $ —\nExpected return on plan assets (6.2 ) (6.0 ) — —\nAmortization of prior service cost — 0.1 — —\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 0.8 1.2 0.1 —\nNet periodic (benefit) cost $ (1.6 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 0.1 $ —\nEmployer contributions, net $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2\nPension Plan and SERP Postretirement Plan\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 11.4 $ 13.1 $ 0.1 $ —\nExpected return on plan assets (18.8 ) (18.2 ) (0.1 ) —\nAmortization of prior service cost 0.2 0.2 — —\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 2.5 3.9 0.4 —\nNet periodic (benefit) cost $ (4.7 ) $ (1.0 ) $ 0.4 $ —\nEmployer contributions, net $ 0.5 $ 1.5 $ 0.7 $ 1.0\nThe expected contributions to the Pension Plan, SERP, and Postretirement Plan for the year ending December 31, 2024 are\nconsistent with the amounts previously disclosed as of December 31, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\n14. Segment Reporting:\nASC 280-10, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (“ASC 280-10”), establishes standards for\nreporting information about operating segments. ASC 280-10 requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive\ninformation about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial\ninformation is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate\nresources and in assessing performance. Our President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") is identified as the CODM as defined by\nASC 280-10.\nEach of the reportable segments, Insurance, and Energy and Specialized Markets, has a portion of its revenue from more than\none of the three revenue types described within our revenue recognition policy. Below is the overview of the solutions offered within\neach reportable segment.\nInsurance: We are the leading provider of statistical, actuarial, and underwriting data for the U.S. P&C insurance industry.\nOur databases include cleansed and standardized records describing premiums and losses in insurance transactions, casualty and\nproperty risk attributes for commercial buildings and their occupants, and fire suppression capabilities of municipalities. We use this\ndata to create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost\nestimates used to price insurance policies, which are accessed via a hosted platform. We also develop solutions that our customers use\nto analyze key processes in managing risk. Our combination of algorithms and analytic methods incorporates our proprietary data to\ngenerate solutions. We also help businesses and governments better anticipate and manage climate and weather-related risks. In most\ncases, our customers integrate the solutions into their models, formulas, or underwriting criteria in order to predict potential loss\nevents, ranging from hurricanes to earthquakes. We develop catastrophe and extreme event models and offer solutions covering\nnatural and man-made risks, including acts of terrorism. We further develop solutions that allow customers to quantify costs after loss\nevents occur. Our multitier, multispectral terrestrial imagery and data acquisition, processing, analytics, and distribution system using\nthe remote sensing and machine learning technologies help gather, store, process, and deliver geographic and spatially referenced\ninformation that supports uses in many markets. Additionally, we offer fraud-detection solutions including review of data on claim\nhistories, analysis of claims to find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of suspicious claims in the insurance sector. Our\nunderwriting, insurance anti-fraud claims, catastrophe modeling, and loss quantification solutions are included in this segment.\nEnergy and Specialized Markets: On February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy segment. We determined that\nthe transaction met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the financial operations of Energy are excluded\nfrom the segment disclosure. See Note 7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion. Prior to the sale, we were a\nleading provider of data analytics via hosted platform for the global energy, chemicals, and metals and mining industries. Our research\nand consulting solutions focused on exploration strategies and screening, asset development and acquisition, commodity markets, and\ncorporate analysis in the areas of business environment, business improvement, business strategies, commercial advisory, and\ntransaction support. We gathered and managed proprietary information, insight, and analysis on oil and gas fields, mines, refineries,\nand other assets across the interconnected global energy sectors to advise customers in making asset investment and portfolio\nallocation decisions. Our analytical tools measured and observed environmental properties and translated those measurements into\nactionable information based on customer needs. In addition, we provided market and cost intelligence to energy companies to\noptimize financial results.\nAs of February 1, 2023, we have determined that we have one operating segment and one reportable segment, Insurance, on\na prospective basis. The segment is based on financial information that is utilized by the Company’s CODM, who is the Company’s\nCEO, to assess performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis. We have included the results of our disposed of segments\nbelow for comparability purposes. We use EBITDA as the profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing\noperations. EBITDA is net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of fixed and\nintangible assets. EBITDA is the measure of operating results used to assess corporate performance and optimal utilization of debt and\nacquisitions. Operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees,\nconsulting, travel, and third-party information services. We do not allocate interest expense and provision for income taxes, since\nthese items are not considered in evaluating the segment’s overall operating performance. In addition, our CODM does not evaluate\nthe financial performance of each segment based on assets. See Note 3. Revenues for information on disaggregated revenues by type\nof service and by country.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide our revenue and EBITDA by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, and the reconciliation of EBITDA to income before income taxes as shown in our accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nInsurance Total Insurance Total\nRevenues $ 725.3 $ 725.3 677.6 $ 677.6\nExpenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) (223.4 ) (223.4 ) (217.2 ) (217.2 )\nSelling, general and administrative (114.0 ) (114.0 ) (111.6 ) (111.6 )\nInvestment gain (loss) 5.9 5.9 (2.0 ) (2.0 )\nEBITDA $ 393.8 $ 393.8 $ 346.8 $ 346.8\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets (58.1 ) (48.1 )\nAmortization of intangible assets (18.3 ) (19.6 )\nInterest expense (32.1 ) (29.4 )\nIncome before income taxes $ 285.3 $ 249.7\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nInsurance Total Insurance Total\nRevenues $ 2,146.1 $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2 $ 2,004.2\nExpenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) (670.6 ) (670.6 ) (650.3 ) (650.3 )\nSelling, general and administrative (308.4 ) (308.4 ) (277.4 ) (277.4 )\nNet gain on the early extinguishment of debt 3.6 3.6 — —\nInvestment gain (loss) 102.4 102.4 (9.3 ) (9.3 )\nEBITDA $ 1,273.1 $ 1,273.1 $ 1,067.2 1,067.2\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets (174.5 ) (139.2 )\nAmortization of intangible assets (55.0 ) (56.1 )\nInterest expense (90.1 ) (87.4 )\nIncome before income taxes $ 953.5 $ 784.5\nLong-lived assets by country are provided below:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLong-lived assets:\nU.S. $ 2,341.9 $ 2,455.7\nU.K. 630.5 597.9\nOther countries 498.2 502.4\nTotal long-lived assets $ 3,470.6 $ 3,556.0\n25\nTable of Contents\n15. Related Parties:\nWe consider our stockholders that own more than 5.0% of the outstanding stock within the class to be related parties as\ndefined within ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no material\ntransactions with related parties owning more than 5.0% of the entire class of stock.\n26\nTable of Contents\n16. Commitments and Contingencies:\nWe are a party to legal proceedings, investigations, examinations, subpoenas, third party requests, government requests,\nregulatory proceedings and other claims with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business, including the matters\ndescribed below (collectively, “Ongoing Matters”). With respect to Ongoing Matters, we are unable, at the present time, to determine\nthe ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to Ongoing Matters or the impact\nthese matters may have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Although we believe we have strong defenses\nand have appealed adverse rulings to us, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nTelematics Litigation\nAs of April 19, 2024, various Plaintiffs filed a total of 20 separate putative class action lawsuits, sixteen against General\nMotors LLC (“GM”), OnStar LLC (“OnStar”), LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc. (“LexisNexis”) and Verisk in the United States\nDistrict Courts for the Northern District of Georgia, the Eastern District of Michigan, Central District of California, District of New\nJersey, Southern District of New York, Northern District of Alabama, Northern District of Illinois and District of South Carolina, and\nfour against Hyundai Motor America (“Hyundai”) and Verisk in the Central District of California and District of New Jersey, three of\nwhich have been dismissed to date. The Complaints generally allege that the auto manufacturer Defendants collected consumers’\ndriver behavior data through vehicle software, transmitted it to LexisNexis and Verisk, and that LexisNexis and Verisk shared the data\nwith auto insurance companies, without the individuals’ knowledge or consent. Plaintiffs seek certification of both nationwide classes\nof individuals and subclasses of various state residents who had their vehicle’s driving data collected by Defendants and shared with a\nthird party without their consent. The Plaintiffs also seek actual, statutory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, as well as\nreasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. On June 7, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all GM-related lawsuits\nto the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (In Re: Consumer Vehicle Driving Data Tracking Litigation, MDL Case\nNo. 1:24-md-03115-TWT). All discovery proceedings have been stayed. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the\nliability related to these matters, as they are still in their early stages.\nIndemnification Claim\nIn December 2023, we received a Notice of Indemnification claim from the current owner of our former healthcare data\nanalytics subsidiary, which was divested in 2016, relating to an ongoing tax investigation by the Nepalese tax authorities. Pursuant to\nthe 2016 sale agreement, we are subject to indemnification obligations with respect to certain pre-closing tax liabilities of the divested\nentity. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as it is still in its early stages.\nCommercial Litigation\nOn February 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, DDS Striker Holdings LLC and Data Driven Holdings LLC against Verisk\nAnalytics, Inc. and Insurance Service Office, in the Superior Court of Delaware, Case No. N24C-02-130 VLM CCLD. Plaintiffs\nallege claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, common\nlaw fraud, and civil conspiracy in connection with their inability to meet the post-closing earn-out targets negotiated as part of our\nacquisition of Data Driven Safety, LLC. Plaintiffs seek rescissory, out-of-pocket and punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees,\ncosts and other expenses. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, which was fully briefed as of June 21, 2024, and was\npartially denied on August 29, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case\nis still in its early stages.\n27\nTable of Contents\nData Privacy Litigation\nOn or about February 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, Atlas Data Privacy Corp., et al. v. Verisk Analytics, Inc., et al., in the\nSuperior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, Case No. MID-L-000903-24, alleging violations of Daniel’s Law. Atlas claims to\nbe an “assignee” of claims of approximately 19,640 individuals who are “covered persons” under Daniel’s Law, allegedly enacted to\nprovide judicial and law enforcement officers and their family members with the right to prevent disclosure of their personal\ninformation and to enforce those rights against uncooperative data brokers. It is alleged that Defendants have violated Daniel’s Law by\nfailing to respond and comply with their written request to Defendants to cease publicly disclosing or re-disclosing their protected\ninformation. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in the amount of $1,000 per violation under the statute, punitive damages, injunctive relief\nordering compliance with Daniel’s Law, permanent injunctive relief, including the appointment of a qualified independent expert to\nensure compliance with Daniel’s Law, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. On June 21, 2024, the court issued a “lack of\nprosecution” warning to Atlas, advising that the case will be dismissed without prejudice if service is not effectuated by August 20,\n2024. The case was dismissed without prejudice on August 26, 2024. On October 11, 2024, Plaintiffs served Verisk with the\nSummons and Complaint, indicating their intent to revise the lawsuit. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability\nrelated to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\nOn January 30, 2023, Plaintiffs Justin Ahringer and Michael Donner filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States\nDistrict Court, Central District of California, titled Ahringer et al. v. LoanDepot, Inc. and Verisk Analytics, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya,\nCase No.: 8:23-cv-00186. Plaintiffs assert violations of California’s Invasion of Privacy Act, Unfair Competition Law, and a violation\nof class members’ privacy rights under the California Constitution. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants recorded visitors’ electronic\ncommunications without their consent. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of individuals who visited LoanDepot.com and\nprovided personal information on the website’s forms to receive a quote or apply for a loan. They allege that the aggregate claims of\nall members of the proposed class exceeds $5.0 million. Plaintiffs seek compensatory, statutory or punitive damages or restitution, as\nwell as reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims on April 13, 2023. The parties\nengaged in jurisdictional discovery in response to the court’s demand to Plaintiff to demonstrate why this case should not be dismissed\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found jurisdiction is proper and partially denied our motion on February 7, 2024. We\nfiled our Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint on February 22, 2024. The parties have agreed to a settlement in principle.\nOn June 27, 2022, Plaintiff Loretta Williams brought a putative class action against Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya\n(“we,” “our,” or “us”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Williams v. DDR Media, LLC\nand Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya, Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-03789. The Complaint alleges that the Defendants violated the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code 631 (“CIPA”) and invaded Plaintiff’s and class members’ privacy rights when\nDefendants purportedly recorded visitors’ visits to the scrappyrent2own.com website without prior express consent. It is further\nalleged that this conduct constitutes a violation of the California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code Section 17200 et\nseq. and the California Constitution. The Complaint seeks class certification, injunctive relief, statutory damages in the amount of\n$5,000 for each violation, attorneys fees and other litigation costs. Our motion to compel arbitration was fully briefed as of January\n27, 2023. It was denied on February 28, 2023. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on April 13, 2023. On August 18,\n2023 the court granted our motion, dismissing Plaintiff’s claims without prejudice, but giving Plaintiff an opportunity to amend her\nclaims by September 20, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on September 20, 2023. Our motion to dismiss\nthe SAC was fully briefed on December 18, 2023. It was denied on January 30, 2024. The court held an initial case management\nconference for February 9, 2024 and allowed the parties to engage in limited discovery. Our renewed motion to dismiss was filed on\nJuly 19, 2024 and oral argument was held on September 20, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the liability\nrelated to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\nOn December 15, 2021, Plaintiff Jillian Cantinieri brought a putative class action against Verisk Analytics, Insurance\nServices Office and ISO Claims Services, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York, titled Cantinieri v. Verisk Analytics Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 2:21-cv-6911. The Complaint alleges that we failed to\nsafeguard the personally identifiable information (PII) of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed classes from a purported breach of\nour databases by unauthorized entities. Plaintiff and class members allege actual and imminent injuries, including theft of their PII,\nfraudulent activity on their financial accounts, lowered credit scores, and costs associated with detection and prevention of identity\ntheft and fraud. They seek to recover compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, disgorgement of earnings and profits, and\nattorney’s fees and costs. We filed our motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on April 22, 2022. On March 30, 2023, the court denied\nour motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing us an opportunity to re-file the motion once limited jurisdictional discovery has\nbeen completed. Our renewed motion to dismiss was fully briefed on February 16, 2024. At this time, it is not possible to\nreasonably estimate the liability related to this matter, as the case is still in its early stages.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes\nincluded in our annual report on Form 10-K (\"2023 10-K\") dated and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on\nFebruary 21, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including\nbut not limited to those listed under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" in our 2023 Form 10-\nK and those listed under Item 1A in Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are a leading data analytics provider serving clients in the insurance markets.

The Energy business was classified as discontinued\noperations per the guidance in ASC 205-20 in the fourth quarter of 2022, as we determined that this transaction represented a strategic\nshift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed\nfrom continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and assets and\nliabilities held for sale for all periods presented. See Note 7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations for further discussion.\n29\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nKey Performance Metrics\nRevenue growth. We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on\nour ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or\nexpanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.\nWe use year-over-year EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-\nGAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation\nand amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective\nnearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income,\nnet income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in\nconjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We\nbelieve these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater\ntransparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in\nthe use of EBITDA are:\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to\nbe replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nEBITDA growth. We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost\nmanagement and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance\nand facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nEBITDA margin. We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our\nbusiness. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.\nRevenues\nWe earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions,\nrecurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in\nfull upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. As a result,\nthe timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be\nhigher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our\ncustomers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the\nsubscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 81% and 80% of our insurance revenues were derived from hosted subscriptions through\nagreements (generally one to five years) for our solutions, respectively.\nWe also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their\nsubscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring.\nFor example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a\npolicy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or\nuse our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\napproximately 19% and 20% of our insurance revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions,\nrespectively.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nPersonnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPersonnel expenses, which represented approximately 57% and 59% of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to\ndispositions) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation,\nequity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.\nWe assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense,\nbased on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues,\nand all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources,\nand administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as\nfacilities and communications, is also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses based on\nthe nature of the work being performed.\nWhile we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the\neconomies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically,\nour EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in\nexpenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin\nexpansion.\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses\nassociated with the acquisition, disposition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development\nand enhancement of our next-generation solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of\npersonnel costs. A portion of the other costs such as facilities, insurance, and communications are also allocated to selling, general and\nadministrative expenses based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Our selling, general and administrative\nexpenses exclude depreciation and amortization.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Percentage September 30, Percentage\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(in millions, except for share and per share data)\nStatement of income data:\nRevenues:\nInsurance $ 725.3 $ 677.6 7.0 % $ 2,146.1 $ 2,004.2 7.1 %\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of\nitems shown separately below) 223.4 217.2 2.9 % 670.6 650.3 3.1 %\nSelling, general and administrative 114.0 111.6 2.2 % 308.4 277.4 11.2 %\nDepreciation and amortization of\nfixed assets 58.1 48.1 20.8 % 174.5 139.2 25.4 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 18.3 19.6 (6.6 )% 55.0 56.1 (2.0 )%\nTotal operating expenses, net 413.8 396.5 4.4 % 1,208.5 1,123.0 7.6 %\nOperating income 311.5 281.1 10.8 % 937.6 881.2 6.4 %\nOther income (expense):\nNet gain on early extinguishment\nof debt — — — % 3.6 — 100.0 %\nInvestment gain (loss) 5.9 (2.0 ) 395.0 % 102.4 (9.3 ) 1,201.1 %\nInterest expense, net (32.1 ) (29.4 ) 9.2 % (90.1 ) (87.4 ) 3.1 %\nTotal other (expense) income,\nnet (26.2 ) (31.4 ) (16.6 )% 15.9 (96.7 ) (116.4 )%\nIncome from continuing\noperations before income taxes 285.3 249.7 14.3 % 953.5 784.5 21.5 %\nProvision for income taxes (65.3 ) (62.3 ) 4.8 % (206.3 ) (198.4 ) 4.0 %\nIncome from continuing\noperations 220.0 187.4 17.4 % 747.2 586.1 27.5 %\nLoss from discontinued operations\nnet of tax expense of $0.0, $0.0,\n$0.0, and $0.2, respectively (Note\n7) — — — % — (145.5 ) (100.0 )%\nNet income 220.0 187.4 17.4 % 747.2 440.6 69.6 %\nLess: Net loss attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests 0.1 — — % 0.6 — — %\nNet income attributable to\nVerisk $ 220.1 $ 187.4 17.4 % $ 747.8 $ 440.6 69.7 %\nBasic net income per share\nattributable to Verisk:\nIncome from continuing\noperations $ 1.55 $ 1.29 20.2 % $ 5.24 $ 3.98 31.7 %\nLoss from discontinued operations — — — % — (0.99 ) (100.0 )%\nBasic net income per share\nattributable to Verisk: $ 1.55 $ 1.29 20.2 % $ 5.24 $ 2.99 75.3 %\nDiluted net income per share\nattributable to Verisk:\nIncome from continuing\noperations $ 1.54 $ 1.29 19.4 % $ 5.22 $ 3.96 31.8 %\nLoss income from discontinued\noperations - - — % $ — $ (0.98 ) (100.0 )%\nDiluted net income per share\nattributable to Verisk: $ 1.54 $ 1.29 19.4 % $ 5.22 $ 2.98 75.2 %\nCash dividends declared per share (1): $ 0.39 $ 0.34 14.7 % $ 1.17 $ 1.02 14.7 %\nWeighted average shares\noutstanding:\nBasic 141,778,551 145,011,020 (2.2 )% 142,594,074 147,292,590 (3.2 )%\nDiluted 142,511,476 145,742,519 (2.2 )% 143,259,411 147,983,986 (3.2 )%\nThe financial operating data below\nsets forth the information we\nbelieve is useful for investors in\nevaluating our overall financial\nperformance:\nOther data:\nEBITDA(2) $ 393.8 $ 346.8 13.6 % $ 1,273.1 $ 1,067.2 19.3 %\nThe following is a reconciliation of\nnet income to EBITDA:\nNet income $ 220.0 $ 187.4 17.4 % $ 747.2 $ 440.6 69.6 %\nLess: Loss from discontinued\noperations — — — % — 145.5 (100.0 )%\nIncome from continuing\noperations 220.0 187.4 17.4 % 747.2 586.1 27.5 %\nDepreciation and amortization of\nfixed assets and intangible assets 76.4 67.7 12.9 % 229.5 195.3 17.5 %\nInterest expense 32.1 29.4 9.2 % 90.1 87.4 3.1 %\nProvision for income taxes 65.3 62.3 4.8 % 206.3 198.4 4.0 %\nEBITDA $ 393.8 $ 346.8 13.6 % $ 1,273.1 $ 1,067.2 19.3 %\n32\nTable of Contents\n(1) Cash dividends declared per share is calculated by the aggregate cash dividends declared in a fiscal quarter divided by the\nshares issued and outstanding. See Note 11. of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this interim report\non Form 10-Q.\n(2) EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. \"EBITDA\" is defined as\nnet income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible\nassets. See Note 14. of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nAlthough EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in\ntheir evaluation of companies. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a\nsubstitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flows from operating activities reported under GAAP.\nManagement uses EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of\ncompany performance. Some of these limitations are:\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual\ncommitments;\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n• Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have\nto be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\n33\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues\nRevenues for our Insurance segment were $725.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$677.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $47.7 million or 7.0%.

Our recent\nacquisitions, inclusive of our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), accounted for an increase of $20.8 million in selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses. This increase was primarily due to our earn-out credit of $22.0 million in the prior year that did not recur in\nthe current period. The remaining increase of $10.2 million or 3.5% was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of\n$10.1 million, salaries and employee benefits of $9.9 million, a loss of $6.9 million primarily due to the disposal of certain leasehold\nimprovements related to our lease modification, increases in insurance costs of $1.7 million, data costs of $1.4 million, and travel\nexpenses of $1.0 million, partially offset by a prior year litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million related to our former Financial\nServices segment, decreases in fees and membership costs of $1.2 million, and other operating costs of $0.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets were $174.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $139.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $35.3 million or 25.4%.

We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in higher credit quality financial\ninstitutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a vast majority of our\ndomestic cash and cash equivalents is with TD Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase N.A. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and\ngenerally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is\nusually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated\nsignificant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Credit Facility, we\nexpect that we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans.\nWe have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer\nour solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or\nannually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and\ncash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is\ndeferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the\nservices. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash\nas a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of\ncash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.\nWe have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased $750.0 million (inclusive of $60.0 million in treasury stock not yet\nsettled) and $2,549.8 million (inclusive of $500.0 million in treasury stock then not yet settled), respectively, of our common stock.\nThe repurchase of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 was funded using cash from operations. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, we also paid dividends of $166.6 million and $147.9 million, respectively.\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\nWe had total debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs\nof $3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and we were in compliance\nwith our financial and other covenants. The debt at September 30, 2024, primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2024, 2023, 2020,\n2019, and 2015. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\nwere recorded as \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in\nthe accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-Q over the life of the respective senior note. The\nindenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback\ntransactions, and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into,\nany other person or entity. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations,\nwhich may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any\nsuch repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or\notherwise. See Note 10. for additional information on our financing activities.\nWe have a $1,000.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP\nMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs\nBank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an\ninterest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the\nend of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0. At our election, the maximum\nconsolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more\nthan once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate\npurposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. As\nof September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was $995.5\nmillion and $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nPercentage Percentage\n2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change\n(in millions) (in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 296.2 $ 250.1 18.4 % $ 888.6 $ 808.3 9.9 %\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing\nactivities $ (52.6 ) $ (55.3 ) 4.9 % $ (76.4 ) $ 2,803.5 (102.7 )%\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (421.3 ) $ (89.6 ) 370.2 % $ (658.2 ) $ (3,491.4 ) 81.1 %\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $296.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared\nto $250.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $46.1 million or 18.4%.

Net cash used in financing activities of $89.6 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the repurchase of common stock of $49.8 million and dividends paid of\n$49.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised of $19.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $658.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven\nby the funding of $750.0 million of accelerated share repurchase programs, the payment on the early extinguishment of debt of $396.4\nmillion, and dividends paid of $166.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of original\ndiscount, of $590.2 million, and proceeds from stock options exercised of $110.6 million.

These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to\nacquisition purchase price allocations, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits,\nstock-based compensation, income taxes, and allowance for doubtful accounts. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or\nconditions.

We also continued our\ncommitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase activity with the completion of\nour $400 million accelerated share repurchase in October 2024.\"\nSummary of Results (GAAP and Non-GAAP) from Continuing Operations\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNote: Adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenues $ 725 677 7.0% $ 2,146 $ 2,004 7.1%\nIncome from continuing operations 220 187 17.4 747 586 27.5\nAdjusted EBITDA 401 366 9.4 1,178 1,072 10.0\nDiluted EPS attributable to Verisk 1.54 1.29 19.4 5.22 3.96 31.8\nDiluted adjusted EPS 1.67 1.52 9.9 5.04 4.31 16.9\nNet cash provided by operating activities 296 250 18.4 889 808 9.9\nFree cash flow 241 196 22.9 720 635 13.5\nRevenues from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated and OCC revenues increased 7.0% and 6.8%, respectively, with solid growth contributions from both\nunderwriting and claims within Insurance.\nRevenues and Revenue Growth\n(in millions)\nNote: OCC revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure.\nRevenue Growth\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, 2024\n2024 2023 Reported OCC\nUnderwriting $ 507 $ 475 6.7% 6.5%\nClaims 218 202 7.9 7.4\nInsurance $ 725 $ 677 7.0 6.8\n3\nRevenue Growth\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, 2024\n2024 2023 Reported OCC\nUnderwriting $ 1,513 $ 1,414 7.0% 6.8%\nClaims 633 590 7.3 6.0\nInsurance $ 2,146 $ 2,004 7.1 6.5\nInsurance revenues grew 7.0% in the third quarter and 6.8% on an OCC basis.\nUnderwriting revenues increased 6.7% in the quarter and 6.5% on an OCC basis, primarily due to our forms,\nrules and loss cost services and extreme event solutions. Specialty business and life solutions also\ncontributed to the growth.\nClaims revenues increased 7.9% in the quarter and 7.4% on an OCC basis, primarily due to growth in our\nanti-fraud solutions and property estimating solutions.\nIncome and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations\nDuring third-quarter 2024, income from continuing operations was $220 million, an increase of 17.4%. The increase in\nincome from continuing operations was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and cost discipline, a litigation reserve\nexpense of $19.2 million in the prior year associated with our former Financial Services segment, and a lower effective tax\nrate.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 9.4%, and 7.2% on an OCC basis, primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost\ndiscipline.\nSegment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(in millions)\nNote: Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

The increase in Diluted EPS\nwas driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense of $19.2 million in the prior year and a lower\neffective tax rate. Diluted adjusted EPS increased 9.9% to $1.67 for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting revenue and profit\ngrowth, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count due to our accelerated share repurchase program.\nCash Flow and Free Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $296.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 18.4%, and free cash flow\nwas $240.7 million, up 22.9%. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit.\nDividend\nOn September 30, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the\nholders of record as of September 15, 2024.\nOn October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued\nand outstanding.

These\nstatements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties,\nand other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially\ndifferent from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-\nlooking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common\nstock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings,\nfinancial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and\nuncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the\nnegative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking\nstatements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases,\nbeyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in\nour quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions\nprove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this\nrelease reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to\npublicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future\n7\nevents, or otherwise except as required by law.\nNotes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP\nmeasures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful\ninformation to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial\nresults, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i)\ndepreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv)\nprovision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-\nouts), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA\nexpenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because\nthey help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating\nperformance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i)\namortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from\ndispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted\nadjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures\nare useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax\neffect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.\nFree Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with\nGAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash\ngenerated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth\nthrough new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\nOrganic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which\ninclude businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity-method\ninvestments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar\nquarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its\ncurrent-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic\ngrowth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar\n8\nquarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a\ndisposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also\nexcluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the\nbusiness without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent\ndispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and\nadjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the\nunderlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\nwe present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results\nat the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and\nmeaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to\nfacilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate\nmovements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\nSee page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted\nEBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and\na reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to\nfree cash flow.\nWe are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted\nEPS to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability\nof estimating certain items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted\nAdjusted EPS, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other\nnon-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAttached Financial Statements\nPlease refer to the full Form 10-Q filing for the complete financial statements and related notes.\nVERISK ANALYTICS,

These statements relate to\nfuture events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of\nactivity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these\nforward-looking statements. This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the\ndetermination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation\ndeterminations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable\nterminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that\nare, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual\nreports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our\nunderlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our\ncurrent views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations,\ngrowth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents, or otherwise except as required by applicable securities laws.\nNotes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or\nan alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures\nprovides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of\nsenior management.\n©Verisk Analytics, Inc. All rights reserved. 2\n3Q 2024 Earnings Presentation\nBusiness and Financial Highlights\n• Organic constant currency (OCC) revenue grew 6.8%, with 6.5% growth\nin Underwriting and 7.4% growth in Claims.\n• OCC subscription revenue grew 9.1%, with broad-based growth across\nmost of our businesses including Forms, Rules and Loss Costs, Anti-\nFraud, Extreme Event Solutions, and Property Estimating Solutions.\n• OCC transactional revenue declined 2.5%, primarily driven by the\nongoing conversions to subscriptions and lower auto-related\ntransactional activity.\n• OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.2% was driven by leverage on the\ncontinued revenue growth and cost discipline, partially offset by\ninvestments in growth initiatives.\n• Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points to 55.2% in the\nquarter and 130 bps to 54.6% on trailing twelve months basis reflecting\nstrong operational leverage, cost discipline and a benefit from FX\ntranslation.\n• Returned $55 million in dividends and initiated a new $400 million ASR\nthat was completed in October.\n©Verisk Analytics, Inc.

AAllll rriigghhttss rreesseerrvveedd.. 17\n3Q 2024 Earnings Presentation\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nSpecified Metrics\nWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and\nmay be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding\ncertain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting\nand planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses\nEBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv) provision for income taxes.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow for greater transparency regarding our operating\nperformance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions\n(which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We\nbelieve these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring\nitems.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure\nof the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make\nacquisitions.\nOrganic\nOrganic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and\nequity-method investments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of\nthe acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition\n(which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S.\nGAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic\npresentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for\nwhich results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial\ninformation to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the\ncurrency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating\nperformance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\n©Verisk Analytics, Inc.
