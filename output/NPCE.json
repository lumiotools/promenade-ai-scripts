(Nasdaq: NPCE), a medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people living with epilepsy, today announced Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submission of three-year safety and effectiveness data from its prospective Post-Approval Study (PAS) of the RNS System in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The study enrolled more than three hundred patients from more than thirty leading Level 4 Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers in the United States, making it the largest prospectively enrolled trial in the field of neuromodulation for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\n\n“We are excited to have completed the prospective three-year follow up of patients enrolled in this important study and to have submitted the data to the FDA,“ said Joel Becker, NeuroPace’s Chief Executive Officer. “As the leader in the field of responsive neurostimulation to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, we are committed to studying the impact of RNS System treatment over time in order to continue generating high-quality clinical evidence. This study is a key part of our ongoing commitment to provide physicians the information they need to confidently select and treat their patients with the RNS System.”\n\nFocal epilepsy, in which seizures originate from specific areas of the brain, is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy. It is typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and often results in a lifetime of seizures. Further consequences from uncontrolled seizures include poor cognitive outcomes, depression, decreased social interaction with peers, increased seizure frequency, and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\n\nThis RNS System PAS study is a five-year prospective, multicenter study required by FDA to gather additional data on the safety and effectiveness of the RNS System as an adjunctive therapy for adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The pre-specified primary effectiveness endpoint is at three years of treatment.\n\n“We are excited to reach this important follow up milestone and look forward to FDA review, as well as future peer reviewed publication and presentation of this rigorously collected clinical data,” said Martha Morrell, M.D., NeuroPace’s Chief Medical Officer. “The RNS System is the only neuromodulation device that provides stimulation and monitors their response over time. The power of this approach was demonstrated in the randomized controlled and long-term treatment trials. Information from the Post-approval Study will further support physicians as they seek to optimize care for drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients,” added Dr. Morrell.\n\nThe RNS PAS study is planned to continue to a five-year follow-up endpoint as part of the RNS System’s initial FDA approval.\n\n**About NeuroPace, Inc.** Based in Mountain View, Calif., NeuroPace is a medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people living with epilepsy by reducing or eliminating the occurrence of debilitating seizures. Its novel and differentiated RNS System is the first and only commercially available, brain-responsive platform that delivers personalized, real-time treatment at the seizure source. This platform can drive a better standard of care for patients living with drug-resistant epilepsy and has the potential to offer a more personalized solution and improved outcomes to the large population of patients suffering from other brain disorders.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** _This press release may contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
