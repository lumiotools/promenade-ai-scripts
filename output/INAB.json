The survival data along with histopathology and radiographic data are indicative of positive treatment effects, which highlight the potential of IN8bio’s genetically modified, chemotherapy-resistant gamma-delta T cells as a potential first-in-class therapy for patients with solid tumor cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM).\n\n“As the clinical trial data continues to mature, this novel immuno-cell therapy leveraging gamma-delta T cells is highly feasible with a well-tolerated safety profile and biological evidence of improved immune surveillance in glioblastoma patients,” said Burt Nabors, M.D., Division Director, Neuro-Oncology at the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\n“This novel treatment leverages the DNA damage induced by chemotherapy combined with genetically engineered gamma-delta T cells and we believe it represents a significant advancement in the treatment of solid tumor cancers such as GBM,” said William Ho, co-founder and CEO of IN8bio. “Glioblastomas are often classified as cold, immune desert tumors due to their limited immune cell infiltration. For the first time, we have confirmed the infiltration of gamma-delta T cells into these tumors through paired tissue biopsies following treatment with INB-200. We are encouraged by the patient follow-up with repeat dose patients demonstrating a 79% increase in median PFS as compared to 6.9 months as reported by the Stupp regimen and an almost 50% increase in median PFS as compared to the 8.3 months in the three patients treated with only a single dose of INB-200 in Cohort 1. The addition of IN8bio’s DeltEx drug resistant immunotherapy (DRI) gamma-delta T cells show the potential for extending PFS in this difficult-to-treat patient population when INB-200 was administered in combination with the current standard-of-care used to treat newly diagnosed GBM patients.”\n\nThe Phase 1 trial assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of the addition of DeltEx DRI gamma-delta T cells to maintenance therapy with TMZ. The trial assessed the administration of 1x107 cells per dose across three different dosing regimens increasing from a single dose in Cohort 1, three doses in Cohort 2, and six doses in Cohort 3. A total of 13 patients have been enrolled and treated with INB-200, including three patients in Cohort 1, four patients in Cohort 2 and six patients in Cohort 3.\n\nKey findings from the INB-200 Phase 1 trial:\n\n  * 92% of evaluable patients treated with INB-200 for GBM surpassed a median standard-of-care (Stupp regimen) PFS of 6.9 months, with a majority exceeding their expected PFS based on their age and the MGMT status of their tumors.\n  * One patient with an IDH-mutant glioma remains alive and progression free at over 40.5 months; IDH-mutant patients in a recently published clinical trial demonstrated a median PFS of 11.1 months in the control arm and 27.7 months in the experimental arm.\n  * No treatment-related serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, infusion reactions, or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome have been reported in any cohort.\n  * The most common treatment emergent adverse events were Grade 1-2 toxicities consisting of white blood cell and platelet count decreases related to standard-of-care TMZ.\n  * Gamma-delta T cells and other immune subsets such as CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were found in relapsed tumor biopsies in two patients after treatment with INB-200, pointing to persistence of DRI gamma-delta T cells.\n  * Gamma-delta T cells were within the normal range post-resection and remained stable with repeated doses (Cohorts 2 and 3), whereas the gamma-delta T cells in Cohort 1 continued to drop after the maintenance cycles with TMZ were initiated. This implies that repeat dosing of gamma-delta T cells may globally benefit the peripheral immune environment.\n  * T cells were low prior to surgery, rose after resection and during the cell collection for the product, were below normal during chemotherapy, and in Cohorts 2 and 3 returned to the normal range following treatment.\n  * Radiographic evaluation pre- and post-treatment included resolution of midline shift in one patient with evidence of changes in enhancement attributed to treatment effect in multiple patients. One subject was found to have a 36% decrease in a lesion attributed to positive treatment effect.\n\n\n\n**About IN8bio** IN8bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gamma-delta T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer patients.

(Nasdaq: INAB)** , a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative gamma-delta T cell therapies for cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate highlights.\n\n“This past quarter marked a critical moment for IN8bio. We streamlined our operations and refined our pipeline to focus our resources. This strategic realignment enhances our capacity to deliver on the potential of gamma-delta T cell therapies, which are increasingly gaining recognition for their significant contributions to immunity.” said William Ho, CEO and co-founder of IN8bio. “INB-100 is our allogeneic therapy in development for the treatment of patients with leukemias. The FDA’s guidance received in a Type B meeting over the summer provides a clear path forward for a potential registrational trial. We’ve secured additional funding to advance INB-100 through the ongoing expansion cohort in the Phase 1 study that will provide additional data to further de-risk the program. With a leaner, more focused organization, we are advancing INB-100 and seeking opportunities to potentially partner assets in our pipeline.”\n\n**Corporate Highlights and Recent Developments**\n\n  * IN8bio will present updated clinical trial results from INB-200 in a Plenary Oral Presentation at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) in November 2024.\n  * A poster presentation updating patient data from the INB-100 trial will be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2024. \n  * Secured net proceeds of $11.6 million from a private placement that is expected to provide cash runway into the first quarter of 2026. \n    * Funding is expected to be used to continue to advance development of INB-100, future product candidates and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n    * Focusing on continued enrollment in the Phase 1 expansion cohort of up to approximately 25 patients at the RP2D of INB-100, with plans to potentially add additional centers and include a parallel observational arm to provide control data.\n  * Received FDA guidance in a Type B meeting, on the registrational path for INB-100 in AML, an allogeneic gamma-delta T cell therapy demonstrating early signs of activity in high-risk leukemia patients. \n    * All AML patients treated with INB-100 have remained in CR as of August 31, 2024.\n    * Older, high-risk leukemia patients receiving non-myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), have exceeded the expected one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of approximately 40-50% post-haploidentical transplantation.\n    * These data continue to demonstrate the broad clinical potential of gamma-delta T cells for difficult-to-treat cancers and provides support for the advancement of these therapies into pivotal trials.\n    * Significant dose-dependent in vivo expansion and long-term persistence of circulating gamma-delta T cells has been observed up to 365 days.\n  * IN8bio implemented a plan to optimize resource allocation through pipeline prioritization and a strategic workforce reduction that was completed in the third quarter of 2024. IN8bio also suspended enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial of INB-400 for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) but will continue monitoring previously treated GBM patients in both the Phase 2 INB-400 and the Phase 1 INB-200 clinical trials to assess progression-free and overall survival. Updated data to be presented at future medical meetings.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) expenses: **R&D expenses were $3.3 million, compared to $3.8 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease of $0.5 million was primarily due to a decrease of $0.6 million in personnel expenses, including salaries and stock-based compensation (SBC) as a result of our workforce reduction and a decrease of $0.1 million in facility-related and other expenses primarily due to decreases in R&D activities in connection with our pipeline prioritization, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in direct costs related to our clinical trials, primarily related to the INB-400 program. As part of the Company's pipeline prioritization announced in September 2024, further clinical development on INB-400 has been suspended.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) expenses:** G&A expenses were $2.7 million, compared to $3.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease of $0.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and bonus expense in connection with our workforce reduction and cost savings related to directors' and officers' insurance premiums, partially offset by an increase in professional services.\n\n**Severance and related charges:** Severance and related charges were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to zero for the comparable prior year period. The increase of $1.1 million was due to one-time costs related to the September 2024 workforce reduction, including SBC expense of $0.8 million resulting from acceleration in full of outstanding unvested stock options at the separation date for the impacted employees, and $0.3 million related to severance payments.\n\n**Net loss:** Net loss was $7.1 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share, for the comparable prior year period.\n\n**Cash position:** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $4.0 million, compared to $10.2 million, as of June 30, 2024. Subsequently in October 2024 closed a Private Placement of $11.6 Million in net proceeds.\n\n**About IN8bio**\n\nIN8bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gamma-delta T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer patients.
