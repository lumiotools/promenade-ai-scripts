Our year-to-date performance – a 13.8% unannualized economic return – reflects both the benefits of our active portfolio management and the increasingly positive macroeconomic conditions. \"The long-awaited monetary policy pivot by the Fed occurred at its September meeting with an initial 50 basis point rate cut. Consistent with historical experience, the Fed is expected to return the federal funds rate to a neutral level over the next 12 to 24 months, which would typically be accompanied by a steepening of the yield curve and growing demand for high quality fixed income instruments such as Agency MBS. Although the path of financial markets is never perfectly linear and periods of volatility are inevitable, the outlook for Agency MBS today is decidedly better than it was in 2022 and 2023 as a result of the positive direction of the broader economy, the accommodative Fed monetary policy stance, and the stability of Agency MBS spreads at these historically favorable levels.\"\"AGNC's 9.3% economic return on tangible common equity in the third quarter was comprised of $0.36 of dividends per common share and a $0.42 increase in tangible net book value per common share,\" said Bernice Bell, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"During the third quarter, we issued $781 million in common stock through our ATM program at a considerable premium to our tangible net book value, providing substantial accretion for our stockholders and new capital to fund investments in Agency MBS at attractive levels. AGNC also generated $0.43 per common share of net spread and dollar roll income in the quarter. Finally, our leverage declined modestly to 7.2x at the end of the third quarter (from 7.4x the prior quarter), and we concluded the quarter with $6.2 billion of unencumbered cash and Agency MBS, or 68% of our tangible equity.\"\n\n**TANGIBLE NET BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE** As of September 30, 2024, the Company's tangible net book value per common share was $8.82 per share, an increase of 5.0% for the quarter compared to $8.40 per share as of June 30, 2024.

Tangible net book value per common share excludes preferred stock liquidation preference and goodwill.\n  2. Table includes non-GAAP financial measures and/or amounts derived from non-GAAP measures. Refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for additional discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\n  3. \"Catch-up\" premium amortization cost/benefit is reported in interest income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n  4. Amount reported in gain (loss) on derivatives instruments and other securities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n  5. Dollar roll income represents the price differential, or \"price drop,\" between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement. Amount includes dollar roll income (loss) on long and short TBA securities. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments.\n  6. Represents periodic interest rate swap settlements. Amount excludes interest rate swap termination fees, mark-to-market adjustments and price alignment interest income (expense) on margin deposits.\n  7. Other interest income (expense), net includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents, price alignment interest income (expense) on margin deposits, and other miscellaneous interest income (expense).\n  8. Investment securities include Agency MBS, CRT and non-Agency securities. Amounts exclude TBA and forward settling securities accounted for as derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.\n  9. The average implied asset yield for TBA dollar roll transactions is extrapolated by adding the average TBA implied funding cost (Note 10) to the net dollar roll yield. The net dollar roll yield is calculated by dividing dollar roll income (Note 5) by the average net TBA balance (cost basis) outstanding for the period.\n  10. The implied funding cost/benefit of TBA dollar roll transactions is determined using the \"price drop\" (Note 5) and market-based assumptions regarding the \"cheapest-to-deliver\" collateral that can be delivered to satisfy the TBA contract, such as the anticipated collateral's weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity and projected 1-month CPR. The average implied funding cost/benefit for all TBA transactions is weighted based on the Company's daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period.\n  11. Amount calculated on a weighted average basis based on average balances outstanding during the period and their respective asset yield/funding cost.\n  12. Represents interest rate swap periodic cost/income measured as a percent of total mortgage funding (Investment Securities Repo, other debt and net TBA securities (at cost)).\n  13. Cost of funds excludes other supplemental hedges used to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate risk (such as swaptions, SOFR futures, and U.S. Treasury positions) and U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  14. Non-Agency MBS, at fair value, excludes $61 million, $60 million, $59 million, $44 million and $45 million of other mortgage credit investments held as of September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2024 and December 31 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  15. Includes TBA dollar roll position and, if applicable, forward settling securities accounted for as derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Amount is net of short TBA securities.\n  16. Average repurchase agreements and other debt excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  17. Average stockholders' equity calculated as the average month-ended stockholders' equity during the quarter.\n  18. Average tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of the daily weighted average Investment Securities Repo, other debt, and TBA and forward settling securities (at cost) outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  19. Tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under Investment Securities Repo, other debt, net TBA position and forward settling securities (at cost), and net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities outstanding by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  20. Average TBA coupon is for the long TBA position only.\n  21. Includes forward starting swaps not yet in effect as of reported period-end.\n  22. Economic return (loss) on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared on common stock during the period over the beginning tangible net book value per common share.\n\n\n\n**STOCKHOLDER CALL** AGNC invites stockholders, prospective stockholders and analysts to attend the AGNC stockholder call on October 22, 2024 at 8:30 am ET.

Forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management of the Company at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements or from our historic performance due to a variety of important factors, including, without limitation, changes in monetary policy and other factors that affect interest rates, MBS spreads to benchmark interest rates, the forward yield curve, or prepayment rates; the availability and terms of financing; changes in the market value of the Company's assets; general economic or geopolitical conditions; liquidity and other conditions in the market for Agency securities and other financial markets; and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Company. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements are included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION** In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company's results of operations discussed in this release include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \"net spread and dollar roll income\"; \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense\"; and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as \"cost of funds\" and \"net interest spread.\"\n\nNet spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders is measured as comprehensive income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders (GAAP measure) adjusted to: (i) exclude gains/losses on investment securities recognized through net income or other comprehensive income and gains/losses on derivative instruments and other securities (GAAP measures), (ii) exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost due to changes in projected CPR estimates and (iii) include interest rate swap periodic income/cost, TBA dollar roll income and other miscellaneous interest income/expense. As defined, net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders represents net interest income/expense (GAAP measure) adjusted to exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost due to changes in projected CPR estimates and to include TBA dollar roll income, interest rate swap periodic income/cost and other miscellaneous interest income/expense, less total operating expense (GAAP measure) and dividends on preferred stock (GAAP measure).\n\nBy providing users of the Company's financial information with such measures in addition to the related GAAP measures, the Company believes users have greater transparency into the information used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that it is important for users of its financial information to consider information related to the Company's current financial performance without the effects of certain transactions that are not necessarily indicative of its current investment portfolio performance and operations.\n\nSpecifically, the Company believes the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income in its non-GAAP measures is meaningful as TBAs are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements but are recognized under GAAP in gain/loss on derivative instruments in the Company's statement of operations. Similarly, the Company believes that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measures, which are recognized under GAAP in gain/loss on derivative instruments, is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument the Company uses to economically hedge against fluctuations in the Company's borrowing costs and inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements is more indicative of the Company's total cost of funds than interest expense alone. Finally, the Company believes the exclusion of \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such \"catch-up\" cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP comprehensive income (loss) to non-GAAP \"net spread and dollar roll income\" is included in this release.\n\nCONTACT:_Investors_ - (301) 968-9300 _Media_ - (301) 968-9303\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH34271&sd=2024-10-21) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-302282185.html>\n\nSOURCE AGNC Investment Corp.\n"

Prior to the fourth quarter 2023, this measure was referred to as \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization cost/benefit, per common share.\" Please refer to the _Reconciliation of GAAP Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Spread and Dollar Roll Income_ and _Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information_ included in this release for additional information.  \n---|---  \n2.| Please refer to _Net Interest Spread Components by Funding Source_ included in this release for additional information regarding the Company's annualized net interest spread.  \n  \n**MANAGEMENT REMARKS** \"AGNC generated a very strong economic return of 9.3% in the third quarter, driven by significant book value growth and our compelling monthly dividend, which has remained stable at $0.12 per common share for 55 consecutive months\" said Peter Federico, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a levered and hedged investor in Agency MBS, AGNC's return opportunities are most favorable when Agency MBS spreads to benchmark rates are wide and stable and interest rates and monetary policy are less volatile. Our year-to-date performance – a 13.8% unannualized economic return – reflects both the benefits of our active portfolio management and the increasingly positive macroeconomic conditions. \"The long-awaited monetary policy pivot by the Fed occurred at its September meeting with an initial 50 basis point rate cut. Consistent with historical experience, the Fed is expected to return the federal funds rate to a neutral level over the next 12 to 24 months, which would typically be accompanied by a steepening of the yield curve and growing demand for high quality fixed income instruments such as Agency MBS. Although the path of financial markets is never perfectly linear and periods of volatility are inevitable, the outlook for Agency MBS today is decidedly better than it was in 2022 and 2023 as a result of the positive direction of the broader economy, the accommodative Fed monetary policy stance, and the stability of Agency MBS spreads at these historically favorable levels.\"\"AGNC's 9.3% economic return on tangible common equity in the third quarter was comprised of $0.36 of dividends per common share and a $0.42 increase in tangible net book value per common share,\" said Bernice Bell, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"During the third quarter, we issued $781 million in common stock through our ATM program at a considerable premium to our tangible net book value, providing substantial accretion for our stockholders and new capital to fund investments in Agency MBS at attractive levels. AGNC also generated $0.43 per common share of net spread and dollar roll income in the quarter. Finally, our leverage declined modestly to 7.2x at the end of the third quarter (from 7.4x the prior quarter), and we concluded the quarter with $6.2 billion of unencumbered cash and Agency MBS, or 68% of our tangible equity.\"\n\n**TANGIBLE NET BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE** As of September 30, 2024, the Company's tangible net book value per common share was $8.82 per share, an increase of 5.0% for the quarter compared to $8.40 per share as of June 30, 2024. The Company's tangible net book value per common share excludes $526 million, or $0.62 and $0.69 per share, of goodwill as of September 30 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\n\n**INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO** As of September 30, 2024, the Company's investment portfolio totaled $73.1 billion, comprised of:\n\n  * $72.1 billion of Agency MBS and TBA securities, including:\n    * $70.7 billion of fixed-rate securities, comprised of:\n      * $66.0 billion 30-year MBS,\n      * $4.1 billion 30-year TBA securities, net,\n      * $0.1 billion 15-year MBS, and\n      * $0.5 billion 20-year MBS; and\n    * $1.4 billion of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), adjustable-rate and other Agency securities; and\n  * $1.0 billion of CRT and non-Agency securities and other mortgage credit investments.\n\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate Agency MBS and TBA securities represented 96% and less than 1%, respectively, of the Company's investment portfolio, unchanged from June 30, 2024.As of September 30, 2024, the Company's fixed-rate Agency MBS and TBA securities' weighted average coupon was 4.90%, compared to 4.95% as of June 30, 2024, comprised of the following weighted average coupons:\n\n  * 4.92% for 30-year fixed-rate securities;\n  * 2.72% for 15-year fixed-rate securities; and\n  * 3.11% for 20-year fixed-rate securities.\n\n\n\nThe Company accounts for TBA securities and other forward settling securities as derivative instruments and recognizes TBA dollar roll income in other gain (loss), net on the Company's financial statements.

Tangible net book value per common share excludes preferred stock liquidation preference and goodwill.\n  2. Table includes non-GAAP financial measures and/or amounts derived from non-GAAP measures. Refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for additional discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\n  3. \"Catch-up\" premium amortization cost/benefit is reported in interest income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n  4. Amount reported in gain (loss) on derivatives instruments and other securities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n  5. Dollar roll income represents the price differential, or \"price drop,\" between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement. Amount includes dollar roll income (loss) on long and short TBA securities. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments.\n  6. Represents periodic interest rate swap settlements. Amount excludes interest rate swap termination fees, mark-to-market adjustments and price alignment interest income (expense) on margin deposits.\n  7. Other interest income (expense), net includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents, price alignment interest income (expense) on margin deposits, and other miscellaneous interest income (expense).\n  8. Investment securities include Agency MBS, CRT and non-Agency securities. Amounts exclude TBA and forward settling securities accounted for as derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.\n  9. The average implied asset yield for TBA dollar roll transactions is extrapolated by adding the average TBA implied funding cost (Note 10) to the net dollar roll yield. The net dollar roll yield is calculated by dividing dollar roll income (Note 5) by the average net TBA balance (cost basis) outstanding for the period.\n  10. The implied funding cost/benefit of TBA dollar roll transactions is determined using the \"price drop\" (Note 5) and market-based assumptions regarding the \"cheapest-to-deliver\" collateral that can be delivered to satisfy the TBA contract, such as the anticipated collateral's weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity and projected 1-month CPR. The average implied funding cost/benefit for all TBA transactions is weighted based on the Company's daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period.\n  11. Amount calculated on a weighted average basis based on average balances outstanding during the period and their respective asset yield/funding cost.\n  12. Represents interest rate swap periodic cost/income measured as a percent of total mortgage funding (Investment Securities Repo, other debt and net TBA securities (at cost)).\n  13. Cost of funds excludes other supplemental hedges used to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate risk (such as swaptions, SOFR futures, and U.S. Treasury positions) and U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  14. Non-Agency MBS, at fair value, excludes $61 million, $60 million, $59 million, $44 million and $45 million of other mortgage credit investments held as of September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2024 and December 31 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  15. Includes TBA dollar roll position and, if applicable, forward settling securities accounted for as derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Amount is net of short TBA securities.\n  16. Average repurchase agreements and other debt excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  17. Average stockholders' equity calculated as the average month-ended stockholders' equity during the quarter.\n  18. Average tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of the daily weighted average Investment Securities Repo, other debt, and TBA and forward settling securities (at cost) outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  19. Tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under Investment Securities Repo, other debt, net TBA position and forward settling securities (at cost), and net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities outstanding by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury Repo.\n  20. Average TBA coupon is for the long TBA position only.\n  21. Includes forward starting swaps not yet in effect as of reported period-end.\n  22. Economic return (loss) on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared on common stock during the period over the beginning tangible net book value per common share.\n\n\n\n**STOCKHOLDER CALL** AGNC invites stockholders, prospective stockholders and analysts to attend the AGNC stockholder call on October 22, 2024 at 8:30 am ET.

Forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management of the Company at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements or from our historic performance due to a variety of important factors, including, without limitation, changes in monetary policy and other factors that affect interest rates, MBS spreads to benchmark interest rates, the forward yield curve, or prepayment rates; the availability and terms of financing; changes in the market value of the Company's assets; general economic or geopolitical conditions; liquidity and other conditions in the market for Agency securities and other financial markets; and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Company. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements are included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise.\n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION** In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company's results of operations discussed in this release include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \"net spread and dollar roll income\"; \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense\"; and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as \"cost of funds\" and \"net interest spread.\"\n\nNet spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders is measured as comprehensive income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders (GAAP measure) adjusted to: (i) exclude gains/losses on investment securities recognized through net income or other comprehensive income and gains/losses on derivative instruments and other securities (GAAP measures), (ii) exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost due to changes in projected CPR estimates and (iii) include interest rate swap periodic income/cost, TBA dollar roll income and other miscellaneous interest income/expense. As defined, net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders represents net interest income/expense (GAAP measure) adjusted to exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost due to changes in projected CPR estimates and to include TBA dollar roll income, interest rate swap periodic income/cost and other miscellaneous interest income/expense, less total operating expense (GAAP measure) and dividends on preferred stock (GAAP measure).\n\nBy providing users of the Company's financial information with such measures in addition to the related GAAP measures, the Company believes users have greater transparency into the information used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that it is important for users of its financial information to consider information related to the Company's current financial performance without the effects of certain transactions that are not necessarily indicative of its current investment portfolio performance and operations.\n\nSpecifically, the Company believes the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income in its non-GAAP measures is meaningful as TBAs are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements but are recognized under GAAP in gain/loss on derivative instruments in the Company's statement of operations. Similarly, the Company believes that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measures, which are recognized under GAAP in gain/loss on derivative instruments, is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument the Company uses to economically hedge against fluctuations in the Company's borrowing costs and inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements is more indicative of the Company's total cost of funds than interest expense alone. Finally, the Company believes the exclusion of \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such \"catch-up\" cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP comprehensive income (loss) to non-GAAP \"net spread and dollar roll income\" is included in this release.\n\nCONTACT:_Investors_ - (301) 968-9300 _Media_ - (301) 968-9303\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH34271&sd=2024-10-21) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-302282185.html>\n\nSOURCE AGNC Investment Corp.\n"
