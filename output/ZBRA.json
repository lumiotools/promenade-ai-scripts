Net sales in the Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (\"EVM\") segment were $845 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $632 million in the prior year. Asset Intelligence & Tracking (\"AIT\") segment net sales were $410 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $324 million in the prior year. Consolidated organic net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 30.6% year-over-year, with a 33.0% increase in the EVM segment and a 25.8% increase in the AIT segment.\n\nThird quarter 2024 gross profit was $613 million compared to $427 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.7% in the prior year due to volume leverage and business mix. Adjusted gross margin was 49.1% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.8% in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses decreased to $422 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $439 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Adjusted operating expenses increased to $364 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $334 million in the prior year.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company completed the actions under its previously announced Exit and Restructuring Plans generating approximately $120 million of net annualized cost savings primarily within Operating expenses, of which, the Company has realized $110 million in net savings to date.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $137 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $15 million, or $0.28 loss per diluted share, in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income increased to $181 million for the third quarter of 2024, or $3.49 per diluted share, compared to $45 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $268 million, or 21.4% of adjusted net sales, compared to $111 million, or 11.6% of adjusted net sales in the prior year primarily due to higher gross margins and lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $676 million and total debt of $2,183 million.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $707 million and the Company invested $41 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $666 million. The Company also had net debt payments of $43 million and share repurchases of $16 million in the first nine months of 2024.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects fourth quarter sales growth between 28% and 31% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency translation is expected to have approximately a 1 percentage point favorable impact.\n\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 22%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.00. This assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 17%.\n\nFree cash flow for the full year is expected to be at least $850 million.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure as discussed under the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" caption below. This would include items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Conference Call Notification**\n\nInvestors are invited to listen to a live webcast of Zebra’s conference call regarding the Company’s financial results.

Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the company’s forward-looking statements. These statements represent estimates only as of the date they were made. Zebra undertakes no obligation, other than as may be required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason after the date of this release.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in Zebra’s industry, market conditions, general domestic and international economic conditions, and other factors. These factors include customer acceptance of Zebra’s offerings and competitors' offerings, and the potential effects of emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. The effect of global market conditions, and the availability of credit and capital markets volatility may have adverse effects on Zebra, its suppliers and its customers. In addition, natural disasters, man-made disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and cybersecurity incidents may have negative effects on Zebra's business and results of operations. Zebra's ability to purchase sufficient materials, parts, and components, and ability to provide services, software and products to meet customer demand could negatively impact Zebra's results of operations and customer relationships. Profits and profitability will be affected by Zebra’s ability to control manufacturing and operating costs. Because of its debt, interest rates and financial market conditions may also have an adverse impact on results. Foreign exchange rates, customs duties and trade policies may have an adverse effect on financial results because of the large percentage of Zebra's international sales. The impacts of changes in foreign and domestic governmental policies, regulations, or laws, as well as the outcome of litigation or tax matters in which Zebra may be involved are other factors that could adversely affect Zebra's business and results of operations. The success of integrating acquisitions could also adversely affect profitability, reported results and the company’s competitive position in its industry. These and other factors could have an adverse effect on Zebra’s sales, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of Zebra's financial results. When used in this release and documents referenced, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook,” and “expect” and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements. Descriptions of certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect the company’s future operations and results can be found in Zebra’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains certain Non-GAAP financial measures, consisting of “adjusted net sales,” “adjusted gross profit,” “adjusted gross margin,” “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA % of adjusted net sales,” “Non-GAAP net income,” “Non-GAAP earnings per share,” “Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share,” “free cash flow,” “organic net sales,” “organic net sales growth,” “organic net sales growth (decline),” “organic net sales (decline) growth,” and “adjusted operating expenses.” Management presents these measures to focus on the on-going operations and believes it is useful to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant items, as a means to understand the performance of its ongoing operations and how management views the business. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables and accompanying disclosures at the end of this press release for more detailed information regarding non-GAAP financial measures herein, including the items reflected in adjusted net earnings calculations. These measures, however, should not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Outlook” above) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nAs a global company, Zebra's operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which the company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar; accordingly, the company presents certain organic growth financial information, which includes impacts of foreign currency translation, to provide a framework to assess how the company’s businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. In addition, the company excludes the impact of its foreign currency hedging program in the prior year periods. The company believes these measures should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of the company’s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Contacts**\n\n_Investors_ Michael Steele, CFA, IRC Vice President, Investor Relations Phone: + 1 847 518 6432 InvestorRelations@Zebra.com\n\n_Media_ Therese Van Ryne Senior Director, External Communications Phone: + 1 847 370 2317 therese.vanryne@zebra.com\n\n![Zebra logo](/content/experience-fragments/zebra1/us/en/footer/master/_jcr_content/root/container_499331825/container/col1par/image.coreimg.png/1697470365249/zebra-footer.png)\n\n**Connect with our team**\n\n[ Contact Zebra  ](/us/en/about-zebra/contact-zebra.html)\n\n[ Find A Partner  ](/us/en/partners/partner-application-locator.html)\n\n  * [About Zebra](/us/en/about-zebra.html)\n  * [Careers](/us/en/about-zebra/careers.html)\n  * [Events](/us/en/about-zebra/newsroom/world-events.html)\n  * [Story Hub/Newsroom](/us/en/about-zebra/newsroom.html)\n  * [Investors](http://investors.zebra.com)\n  * [Corporate Social Responsibility](/us/en/about-zebra/company-information/corporate-social-responsibility.html)\n  * [Global Locations](/us/en/about-zebra/contact-zebra/global-locations.html)\n\n\n\n**Discover**\n\n  * [Solutions](/us/en/solutions.html)\n  * [Products](/us/en/products.html)\n  * [Services](/us/en/services.html)\n  * [Success Stories](/us/en/resource-library/success-stories.html)\n  * [Resource Library](/us/en/resource-library.html)\n\n\n\n**Support Resources**\n\n  * [Support and Downloads](/us/en/support-downloads.html)\n  * [Contact Support](/us/en/about-zebra/contact-zebra/contact-tech-support.html)\n  * [Request a Repair](/us/en/support-downloads/request-repair.html)\n  * [Product Warranty Information](/us/en/support-downloads/warranty/product-warranty.html)\n  * [Developer Portal](https://developer.zebra.com)\n  * [Report a Potential Security Vulnerability or Concern](https://hackerone.com/zebra_vdp?type=team)\n\n\n\n**Stay up to date with Zebra.**\n\nSign up for our newsletter.\n\n[ Register Now  ](#gate-88e268d0-915f-4ed7-91e3-e3ffdf327921)\n\n[ Manage Contact Preferences  ](https://connect.zebra.com/Preferences-enu)\n\n  * [ ](http://www.linkedin.com/company/167024?trk=tyah)\n  * [ ](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zebra-Technologies/107703715989073)\n  * [ ](http://www.youtube.com/zebratechnologies#p/u)\n  * [ ](/us/en/blog.html)\n\n\n\n[Legal ](/us/en/about-zebra/company-information/legal.html)[Terms of Use](/us/en/about-zebra/company-information/legal/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy](/us/en/about-zebra/company-information/legal/privacy-statement.html) [Supply Chain Transparency](/content/dam/zebra_dam/en/policies/corporate/consolidated-modern-slavery-statement-policy-corporate-en-us.pdf)\n\nZEBRA and the stylized Zebra head are trademarks of Zebra Technologies Corp., registered in many jurisdictions worldwide.

Winters, CFO\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES\nQ&A\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES\nAppendix\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES 15\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis presentation contains certain Non-GAAP financial measures, consisting of “adjusted net sales,” “adjusted gross profit,” “adjusted gross\nmargin,” “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA % of adjusted net sales,” “non-GAAP net income,” “non-\nGAAP earnings per share,” “non-GAAP diluted earnings per share,” “free cash flow,” “organic net sales,” “organic net sales growth,” “organic net\nsales growth (decline),” “organic net sales (decline) growth,” and “adjusted operating expenses.” Management presents these measures to focus\non the on-going operations and believes it is useful to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and\npresent operating results. The company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant items, as a\nmeans to understand the performance of its ongoing operations and how management views the business. Please see the “Reconciliation of\nGAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables and accompanying disclosures at the end of this presentation for more detailed information\nregarding non-GAAP financial measures herein, including the items reflected in adjusted net earnings calculations. These measures, however,\nshould not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Outlook”\nabove) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available\nwithout unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred,\nare out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly\ncomparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the\nunavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures\nmay vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nAs a global company, Zebra's operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the\nunderlying foreign currencies in which the company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar; accordingly, the company\npresents certain organic growth financial information, which includes impacts of foreign currency translation, to provide a framework to assess\nhow the company’s businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency impact\nrepresents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses\nwhere the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating current period results at the currency exchange rates\nused in the comparable period in the prior year, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. In addition, the company\nexcludes the impact of its foreign currency hedging program in the prior year periods. The company believes these measures should be\nconsidered a supplement to and not in lieu of the company’s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES 16\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Organic Net Sales\nGrowth (Decline) Growth Reconciliation\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES 17\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Gross Margin\nReconciliation\nZZEEBBRRAA TTEECCHHNNOOLLOOGGIIEESS 18\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income Reconciliation (In millions, except share data)\n(Unaudited)\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES 19\nGAAP to Non-GAAP EBITDA Reconciliation\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES 20\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nZZEEBBRRAA TTEECCHHNNOOLLOOGGIIEESS 21\nAbout Zebra\nZebra (NASDAQ: ZBRA) empowers the front line of business in retail,\nmanufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, and other\nindustries to achieve a performance edge.

STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nZebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or the “Company”) is a global leader providing innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”)\nsolutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions,\nincluding cloud-based software subscriptions, that capture and move data. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support,\nrepair, managed and professional services. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in retail and e-commerce, manufacturing,\ntransportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and other industries. We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force\nand an extensive network of channel partners.\nManagement prepared these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission for interim financial information and notes. As permitted under Article 10 of Regulation S-X and the instructions of Form 10-Q, these\nconsolidated financial statements do not include all the information and notes required by United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)\nfor complete financial statements, although management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These interim\nfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the opinion of the Company, these interim financial statements include all adjustments (of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to fairly present its\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024, the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income and Stockholders’ Equity for the\nthree and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. These results, however, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\nFor a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies within Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our significant accounting\npolicies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 Revenues\nThe Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods, solutions or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which it\nexpects to receive for providing those goods, solutions or services.\nRevenues for tangible products are generally recognized upon shipment, whereas revenues for services and solution offerings are generally recognized over\ntime by using an output or time-based method, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenues for software are recognized either\nupon delivery or over time using a time-based method, depending on how control is transferred to the customer. In cases where a bundle of products, services,\nsolutions and/or software are delivered to the customer, judgment is required to select the method of progress which best reflects the transfer of control.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our Net sales disaggregated by product category for each of our segments (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nServices and Services and\nSegment Tangible Products Software Total Tangible Products Software Total\nAIT $ 382 $ 28 $ 410 $ 295 $ 29 $ 324\nEVM 637 208 845 434 198 632\nTotal $ 1,019 $ 236 $ 1,255 $ 729 $ 227 $ 956\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nServices and Services and\nSegment Tangible Products Software Total Tangible Products Software Total\nAIT $ 1,115 $ 84 $ 1,199 $ 1,222 $ 83 $ 1,305\nEVM 1,816 632 2,448 1,663 607 2,270\nTotal $ 2,931 $ 716 $ 3,647 $ 2,885 $ 690 $ 3,575\nIn addition, refer to Note 16, Segment Information & Geographic Data for Net sales to customers by geographic region.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations relate to services and software solutions. The aggregated transaction price allocated to remaining\nperformance obligations for arrangements with an original term exceeding one year was $1.24 billion and $1.13 billion, inclusive of deferred revenue, as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On average, remaining performance obligations as of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nare expected to be recognized over a period of approximately two years.\nContract Balances\nProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers related to billed revenues is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in\nAccounts receivable, net. Progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers related to unbilled revenues (“contract assets”) is\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets for revenues expected to be billed within the next twelve months,\nand Other long-term assets for revenues expected to be billed thereafter. The total contract asset balances were $13 million and $16 million as of September 28,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These contract assets result from timing differences between billing and satisfying performance obligations, as well\nas the impact from the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations for contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Contract\nassets are evaluated for impairment and no impairment losses have been recognized during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDeferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets consists of payments and billings in advance of our performance. The combined short-term and long-\nterm deferred revenue balances were $736 million and $770 million as of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized $107 million and $374 million in revenue, which was previously included in the beginning\nbalance of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $100 million and\n$349 million in revenue, which was previously included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022.\nNote 4 Inventories\nThe categories of Inventories, net are as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials (1) $ 270 $ 403\nWork in process 3 4\nFinished goods 366 397\nTotal Inventories, net $ 639 $ 804\n(1) Raw material inventories primarily consist of product components as well as supplies used in repair operations.\nNote 5 Investments\nThe carrying value of the Company’s long-term investments, which are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was\n$110 million and $113 million as of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company paid $3 million and $1 million, respectively, for the purchase of\nlong-term investments. Net gains and losses related to the Company’s long-term investments are included within Other expense, net on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. There were no net gains or losses during the three months ended September 28, 2024. The Company recognized net losses of\n$6 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Net gains and losses were not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nNote 6 Exit and Restructuring Costs\nTotal charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan, which was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and the U.S. voluntary retirement plan, which was\ncompleted in 2023, were $127 million incurred to date, including $4 million and $17 million recorded during the three and nine months ended September 28,\n2024. The costs of these plans are classified within Exit and restructuring on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s remaining payment\nobligations of $5 million, are reflected within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe rollforward of the liability associated with Exit and restructuring activities is:\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 22\nExit and restructuring charges 17\nNon-cash utilization (4)\nCash payments (30)\nBalance as of September 28, 2024 $ 5\nNote 7 Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and\nunobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following three broad levels:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to Level 1 inputs (e.g. U.S. Treasuries and money market funds).\n11\nTable of Contents\n• Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. In addition, the Company considers\ncounterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of September 28, 2024, are classified below (in millions):\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestments related to the deferred compensation plan $ 41 $ — $ — $ 41\nTotal Assets at fair value $ 41 $ — $ — $ 41\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts (1) $ 1 $ 14 $ — $ 15\nLiabilities related to the deferred compensation plan 41 — — 41\nTotal Liabilities at fair value $ 42 $ 14 $ — $ 56\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2023, are classified below (in millions):\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nForward interest rate swap contracts (2) $ — $ 83 $ — $ 83\nInvestments related to the deferred compensation plan 41 — — 41\nTotal Assets at fair value $ 41 $ 83 $ — $ 124\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts (1) $ 1 $ 6 $ — $ 7\nForward interest rate swap contracts (2) — 28 — 28\nLiabilities related to the deferred compensation plan 41 — — 41\nTotal Liabilities at fair value $ 42 $ 34 $ — $ 76\n(1) The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is calculated as follows:\n• Fair value of forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward\npoints.\n• Fair value of hedges against net assets denominated in foreign currencies is calculated at the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward\npoints unless the hedge has been traded but not settled at period-end (Level 2). If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the\nhedge is being settled (Level 1).\n(2) The fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs at the quoted intervals, such as\nforward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company’s credit risk and the interest rate swap terms.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 Derivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and\ninterest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to such risks and may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging\ninstruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging\ninstruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue\nderivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures\nthem at fair value. The following table presents the fair value of its derivative instruments (in millions):\nAsset (Liability)\nFair Values as of\nSeptember 28, December 31,\nBalance Sheets Classification 2024 2023\nDerivative instruments designated as hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ (14) $ (6)\nTotal derivative instruments designated as hedges $ (14) $ (6)\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedges:\nForward interest rate swaps Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ — $ 34\nForward interest rate swaps Other long-term assets — 49\nForeign exchange contracts Accrued liabilities (1) (1)\nForward interest rate swaps Accrued liabilities — (12)\nForward interest rate swaps Other long-term liabilities — (16)\nTotal derivative instruments not designated as hedges $ (1) $ 54\nTotal net derivative (liability) asset $ (15) $ 48\nThe following table presents the net gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges (in millions):\nGains (Losses) Recognized in Income\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nStatements of Operations September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\nClassification 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDerivative instruments not designated as\nhedges:\nForeign exchange contracts Foreign exchange (loss) gain $ (7) $ 1 $ (5) $ (3)\nForward interest rate swaps Interest expense, net — 23 31 34\nTotal net (loss) gain recognized in\nincome $ (7) $ 24 $ 26 $ 31\nActivities related to derivative instruments are reflected within Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate payments on its borrowings under a term loan (“Term Loan A”), Revolving Credit Facility,\nand Receivables Financing Facilities, which bear interest at variable rates plus applicable margins. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest\nrates by issuing both fixed and variable rate borrowings as well as periodically utilizing interest rate swaps to economically hedge interest rate exposure based\non current and projected market conditions.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn the second quarter, the Company terminated all of its interest rate swap agreements, none of which were designated as hedges, resulting in a $77 million\ncash receipt that is classified within Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Total cash receipts for the nine months\nended September 28, 2024 were $86 million. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt for further details related to the Company’s borrowings and interest rate exposure.\nCredit and Market Risk Management\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk of nonperformance and to market risk related to currency\nexchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards,\ndiversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company’s counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative\nfinancial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by\nconsidering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the\ncustomers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company’s credit policies are designed to mitigate\nconcentrations of credit risk.\nThe Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are\ndesigned to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. We present the assets and liabilities of our derivative financial\ninstruments, for which we have net settlement agreements in place, on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative financial instruments\nhad been presented gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions would have not been significant as of September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates arises primarily from Euro-denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated\nmonetary assets and liabilities. The Company manages its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by\ninitially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option\ncontracts, as deemed appropriate.\nThe Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro-denominated sales using forward contracts, which typically mature within twelve months of\nexecution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the contract is settled and the hedged sale is realized. The realized gain\nor loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were $2 million\nand $6 million of losses for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales\nwere $4 million of gains and $16 million of losses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 28,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were €622 million and €485 million, respectively.\nThe Company has reviewed its cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined that they are highly effective.\nThe Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its exposures related to net assets denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. These forward contracts typically mature within one month after execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in\nincome and are generally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions. The notional values and the net fair values of these\noutstanding contracts were as follows (in millions):\n14\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n2024 2023\nNotional balance of outstanding contracts:\nBritish Pound/U.S. Dollar £ 2 £ 11\nEuro/U.S. Dollar € 183 € 80\nEuro/Czech Koruna € 16 € 17\nJapanese Yen/U.S. Dollar ¥ 274 ¥ 685\nSingapore Dollar/U.S. Dollar S$ 19 S$ 14\nMexican Peso/U.S. Dollar Mex$ 166 Mex$ 144\nPolish Zloty/U.S. Dollar zł 39 zł 116\nNet fair value of liabilities of outstanding contracts $ 1 $ 1\nNote 9 Long-Term Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm Loan A $ 1,575 $ 1,684\nSenior Notes 500 —\nRevolving Credit Facility — 413\nReceivables Financing Facilities 108 129\nTotal debt $ 2,183 $ 2,226\nLess: Debt issuance costs (11) (2)\nLess: Unamortized discounts (3) (4)\nLess: Current portion of debt (89) (173)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,080 $ 2,047\nAs of September 28, 2024, the future maturities of debt are as follows (in millions):\n2024 (3 months remaining) $ 89\n2025 —\n2026 88\n2027 1,506\n2028 —\nThereafter 500\nTotal future maturities of debt $ 2,183\nAll borrowings as of September 28, 2024 were denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s debt approximated $2.2 billion as of both September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These fair\nvalue amounts, developed based on inputs classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders\ncould trade its debt within the financial markets and do not represent the settlement value of these liabilities to the Company. The fair value of debt will\ncontinue to vary each period based on a number of factors, including fluctuations in market interest rates as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings.\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in the second quarter of 2026 and the majority due upon\nmaturity in 2027. The Company may make prepayments in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding\namounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of September 28, 2024, the Term Loan A interest rate was 6.60%. Interest payments are made\nmonthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSenior Notes\nIn the second quarter, the Company completed a private offering of $500 million senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes”) with a 6.5% fixed interest rate.\nThe net proceeds of the issuance, after deducting debt issuance costs which were deferred, were approximately $492 million. The Senior Notes mature on June\n1, 2032, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year, commencing on December 1, 2024. The Company has the option\nor could be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions.\nThe Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of Zebra’s existing and future subsidiaries. The Senior Notes\ncontain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of Zebra to: (i) grant or incur liens; (ii) have its subsidiaries guarantee debt without becoming\nguarantors; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of its assets.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company had letters of credit totaling $10 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility\nfrom $1,500 million to $1,490 million. As of September 28, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 6.19%. Upon borrowing,\ninterest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 25, 2027.\nReceivables Financing Facility\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company has a Receivables Financing Facility with a borrowing limit of up to $180 million. As collateral, the Company pledges\nperfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under this facility\nas secured borrowings. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company amended this facility to extend the maturity to March 19, 2027 but otherwise did not\nsubstantially change the terms of the facility.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $618 million of gross receivables that were pledged under the facility. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, $108 million had been borrowed, of which $89 million was classified as current. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable\nrate plus an applicable margin. As of September 28, 2024, the facility had an average interest rate of 5.89%. Interest is paid monthly on these borrowings.\nThe Company’s borrowings described above include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial\nratios be maintained at designated levels.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 Leases\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded $36 million of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease\nobligations primarily related to the extension of existing leases and the commencement of a new office facility lease.\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of September 28, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\n2024 (3 months remaining) $ 16\n2025 46\n2026 39\n2027 32\n2028 30\nThereafter 83\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 246\nLess: Interest (44)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 202\nReported as of September 28, 2024:\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities $ 40\nLong-term lease liabilities 162\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 202\nThe current portion of lease liabilities is included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 11 Accrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe components of Accrued liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n2024 2023\nIncentive compensation $ 134 $ 47\nUnremitted cash collections due to banks on factored accounts receivable 77 112\nPayroll and benefits 63 83\nCustomer rebates 50 40\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities 40 42\nWarranty 26 27\nInterest payable 20 2\nFreight and duty 15 10\nExit and restructuring 5 22\nSettlement — 45\nOther 60 74\nAccrued liabilities $ 490 $ 504\n17\nTable of Contents\nWarranties\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s accrued warranty obligations (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\nBalance at the beginning of the period $ 27 $ 26\nWarranty expense 19 21\nWarranties fulfilled (20) (22)\nBalance at the end of the period $ 26 $ 25\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business,\nincluding but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort, and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such\nproceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nAny legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and their potential effects may change in the future. The\nCompany records a liability for contingencies when a loss is deemed to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nNote 12 Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 8.1% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to 37.5% benefit and\n16.0% expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the current periods, the variance from the 21% federal statutory rate was primarily\ndue to the generation of tax credits and the favorable impacts of foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation, offset partially by U.S. State income taxes and\nforeign rate differentials. In the prior periods, the difference was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit from the U.S. voluntary retirement plan, U.S. tax credits,\nand the favorable impacts of foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation.\nNote 13 Earnings (loss) Per Share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted\ncommon shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock method and, in periods of income, reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if\ndilutive share-based compensation awards were converted into common shares during the period.\nEarnings (loss) per share (in millions, except share data):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic:\nNet income (loss) $ 137 $ (15) $ 365 $ 279\nWeighted-average shares outstanding (1) 51,567,216 51,336,645 51,480,812 51,380,876\nBasic earnings (loss) per share $ 2.65 $ (0.28) $ 7.09 $ 5.44\nDiluted:\nNet income (loss) $ 137 $ (15) $ 365 $ 279\nWeighted-average shares outstanding (1) 51,567,216 51,336,645 51,480,812 51,380,876\nDilutive shares (2) 350,839 — 364,760 336,855\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 51,918,055 51,336,645 51,845,572 51,717,731\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ 2.64 $ (0.28) $ 7.04 $ 5.40\n(1) In periods of a net loss, restricted stock and performance share awards, which are participating securities, are excluded from weighted-average shares\noutstanding.\n18\nTable of Contents\n(2) In periods of a net loss, all unvested share-based awards are anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from diluted shares.\nAnti-dilutive share-based compensation awards are excluded from diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations. There were 1,621 and 61,240 shares that were\nanti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. There were 446,331 and 250,025 shares that were anti-dilutive for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nNote 14 Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nStockholders’ equity includes certain items classified as AOCI, including:\n• Unrealized gain (loss) on sales hedging which relates to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for\nforecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses\nuntil the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 8, Derivative Instruments for more details.\n• Foreign currency translation adjustments which relates to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional\ncurrency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company translates the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to U.S. Dollars using a\ncombination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation\nadjustment component of AOCI.\nThe changes in each component of AOCI during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nForeign currency\nUnrealized gain (loss) translation\non sales hedging adjustments Total\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ (11) $ (55) $ (66)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 16 (2) 14\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI(1) 16 — 16\nTax effect (8) — (8)\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 24 (2) 22\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 13 $ (57) $ (44)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (5) $ (49) $ (54)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (3) 1 (2)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI(1) (4) — (4)\nTax effect 1 — 1\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (6) 1 (5)\nBalance at September 28, 2024 $ (11) $ (48) $ (59)\n(1) See Note 8, Derivative Instruments regarding the timing of reclassifications to operating results.\nNote 15 Accounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company transfers certain receivables to banks without recourse as part of its credit and cash management activities. Such transfers are accounted for as\nsales and the related receivables are removed from the Company’s balance sheet. The Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables\nsold. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the\nreceivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating\nactivities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from\nfinancing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company has a Receivables Factoring arrangement that was amended in the current quarter to limit the factoring of uncollected receivables originated\nfrom the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions from €150 million to €75 million, which will revert to €150 million in the fourth quarter if not further amended.\nOtherwise, the amendment did not substantially change the terms\n19\nTable of Contents\nof the arrangement. In the current quarter, the Company terminated its other arrangement, which allowed for the factoring of uncollected receivables originated\nfrom the EMEA region up to $50 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company received cash proceeds of $816 million and $1,077 million,\nrespectively, from the sales of accounts receivables under its factoring arrangement. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were a total of $7\nmillion and $56 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $77 million and $112 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such\nobligations reflected within Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNote 16 Segment Information & Geographic Data\nThe Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). The\nreportable segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker or\n“CODM”) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s segments. The CODM reviews adjusted operating income to assess\nsegment profitability. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of\nintangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-\nrecurring costs. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s CODM and therefore are not disclosed below.\nFinancial information by segment is presented as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales:\nAIT $ 410 $ 324 $ 1,199 $ 1,305\nEVM 845 632 2,448 2,270\nTotal Net sales $ 1,255 $ 956 $ 3,647 $ 3,575\nOperating income (loss):\nAIT(2) $ 83 $ 44 $ 232 $ 287\nEVM(2) 142 30 385 285\nTotal segment operating income 225 74 617 572\nCorporate (1) (34) (86) (100) (165)\nTotal Operating income (loss) $ 191 $ (12) $ 517 $ 407\n(1) To the extent applicable, amounts included in Corporate consist of business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets,\nacquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, and exit and restructuring costs.\n(2) AIT and EVM segment operating income includes depreciation and share-based compensation expense.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a global leader in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture,\nradio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other workflow automation products and services. The Company’s solutions are proven\nto help our customers and end-users digitize and automate their workflows to achieve their critical business objectives, including improved productivity and\noperational efficiency, optimized regulatory compliance, and better customer experiences.\nWe design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of AIDC products, including: mobile computers, barcode scanners and imagers, RFID readers, specialty\nprinters for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems (“RTLS”), related accessories and supplies, such as labels and other\nconsumables, and related software applications. We also provide machine vision and robotics automation solutions; a full range of services, including\nmaintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services; as well as cloud-based software subscriptions. End-users of our products, solutions\nand services include those in the retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and other industries within North\nAmerica; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Asia Pacific; and Latin America.\nWe continue to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) vision: every asset and front-line worker visible, connected, and fully optimized. Through\ncontinual innovation, we have expanded beyond the traditional AIDC market to transform activities such as factory production, packages moving through a\nsupply chain, retail shopping, and the hospital patient journey. Data from enterprise assets, including status, condition, location, utilization, and preferences, is\nanalyzed in the cloud to provide prioritized actionable insights. As a result, our solutions enable enterprises to “sense, analyze, and act” more effectively to\noptimize their activities.\nThe Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”)\nand Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”).\n• The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers,\nRFID and RTLS offerings, and supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels, and services.\n• The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data\ncapture, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, and workflow optimization solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include\ncloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions.\nWe are a market leader in our core businesses, which are generally considered to be comprised of our mobile computing and data capture products, printing\nproducts and supplies, as well as support and repair services. We continue to focus on growth opportunities within adjacent and expansion markets by scaling\nand integrating our recent business acquisitions.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary and Other Recent Developments\n• Net sales were $1,255 million in the current quarter compared to $956 million in the prior year.\n• Operating income was $191 million in the current quarter compared to an operating loss of $12 million in the prior year.\n21\nTable of Contents\n• Net income was $137 million, or $2.64 per diluted share in the current quarter, compared to a net loss of $15 million, or $(0.28) per diluted share in\nthe prior year.\n• Net cash provided by operating activities was $707 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to net cash used in operating\nactivities of $145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn the current quarter, we saw the continuation of a modest recovery in demand trends that began to broaden across both of our segments. Our third quarter\nrevenues and profitability improved from the first half of the year, and particularly as compared to the prior year which was negatively impacted by broad-\nbased demand declines and distributor inventory reductions. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter.\nThe Company completed its actions under the 2022 Productivity Plan in the third quarter. Total charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan and the U.S.\nvoluntary retirement plan (“VRP”), which was completed in 2023, were $127 million, including $4 million recorded in the current quarter. The costs of these\nactions are classified within Exit and restructuring on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Together, these programs have impacted over 9% of our\nglobal employee base and are expected to result in annualized net cost savings of approximately $120 million, primarily within Operating expenses. The\nCompany has realized $110 million in net savings to date, with $50 million in 2023 and an incremental $60 million in the first nine months of 2024.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales:\nTangible products $ 1,019 $ 729 $ 290 39.8 % $ 2,931 $ 2,885 $ 46 1.6 %\nServices and\nsoftware 236 227 9 4.0 % 716 690 26 3.8 %\nTotal Net sales 1,255 956 299 31.3 % 3,647 3,575 72 2.0 %\nGross profit 613 427 186 43.6 % 1,765 1,675 90 5.4 %\nGross margin 48.8 % 44.7 % 410 bps 48.4 % 46.9 % 150 bps\nOperating expenses 422 439 (17) (3.9)% 1,248 1,268 (20) (1.6)%\nOperating income (loss)$ 191 $ (12) $ 203 1,691.7 % $ 517 $ 407 $ 110 27.0 %\nNet sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNorth America $ 628 $ 517 $ 111 21.5 % $ 1,839 $ 1,884 $ (45) (2.4)%\nEMEA 405 269 136 50.6 % 1,204 1,086 118 10.9 %\nAsia-Pacific 132 106 26 24.5 % 362 382 (20) (5.2)%\nLatin America 90 64 26 40.6 % 242 223 19 8.5 %\nTotal Net sales $ 1,255 $ 956 $ 299 31.3 % $ 3,647 $ 3,575 $ 72 2.0 %\n22\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nAs a % of Net sales As a % of Net sales\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling and marketing $ 151 $ 138 12.0 % 14.4 % $ 449 $ 445 12.3 % 12.4 %\nResearch and development 141 127 11.2 % 13.3 % 425 403 11.7 % 11.3 %\nGeneral and administrative 96 88 7.6 % 9.2 % 274 256 7.5 % 7.2 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 29 26 NM NM 80 78 NM NM\nAcquisition and integration costs 1 2 NM NM 3 4 NM NM\nExit and restructuring costs 4 58 NM NM 17 82 NM NM\nTotal Operating expenses $ 422 $ 439 33.6 % 45.9 % $ 1,248 $ 1,268 34.2 % 35.5 %\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 28, 2024\nReported GAAP Consolidated Net sales growth 31.3 % 2.0 %\nAdjustments:\nImpact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.7)% (0.5)%\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth (2) 30.6 % 1.5 %\n(1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.\nThird quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023\nTotal Net sales increased by $299 million or 31.3% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in both of our segments. The prior year period was negatively\nimpacted by declines in broad-based demand and actions taken by distributors to reduce their on-hand inventory levels. Excluding the effects of currency\nchanges, Consolidated Organic Net sales increased by 30.6%.\nGross margin increased to 48.8% for the current year compared to 44.7% for the prior year. As compared to the prior year, Gross margin was higher in both of\nour segments which benefited from volume leverage in the current year.\nOperating expenses for the quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $422 million and $439 million, or 33.6% and 45.9% of Net sales,\nrespectively. Current year Operating expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental savings\nlargely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. The decrease as a percentage of Net sales compared to\nthe prior year reflects the impact of expense leveraging.\nOperating income was $191 million for the current year compared to an operating loss of $12 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross\nprofit and lower Operating expenses.\nNet income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, partially offset by higher Other expense, net.\nThe increase in Other expense, net was primarily due to interest rate swap gains in the prior year and unfavorable changes in Foreign exchange (loss) gain as\ncompared to the prior year.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 8.1% expense and 37.5% benefit, respectively.\nThe change in the effective tax rates year over year was primarily due to increased foreign income taxed favorably in the U.S. for the current year, while the\nprior year included a discrete tax benefit related to the VRP.\nDiluted earnings per share increased to $2.64 as compared to $(0.28) in the prior year due to higher Net income.\nYear to date 2024 compared to Year to date 2023\nTotal Net sales increased $72 million or 2.0% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in our EVM segment that was largely offset by a decline in our AIT\nsegment as the recovery in demand trends benefited EVM earlier in the current year than AIT. Excluding the effects of currency changes, Consolidated Organic\nNet sales increased by 1.5%.\nGross margin increased to 48.4% for the current year compared to 46.9% for the prior year. As compared to the prior year, Gross margin was higher in our\nEVM segment and lower in our AIT segment.\nOperating expenses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $1,248 million and $1,268 million, or 34.2% and 35.5% of\nNet sales, respectively. Current year Operating expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental\nsavings largely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation.\nOperating income was $517 million for the current year compared to $407 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross profit and lower\nOperating expenses.\nNet income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, partially offset by higher Other expense, net.\nThe increase in Other expense, net was primarily due to unfavorable changes in Foreign exchange (loss) gain as compared to the prior year and a long-term\ninvestment loss in the current year.\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 14.5% and 16.0%, respectively.\nDiluted earnings per share increased to $7.04 as compared to $5.40 in the prior year due to higher Net income.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reportable business segment as detailed in Note 16, Segment\nInformation & Geographic Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business\nacquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles,\nexit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs.\nAsset Intelligence & Tracking Segment (“AIT”)\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales:\nTangible products $ 382 $ 295 $ 87 29.5 % $ 1,115 $ 1,222 $ (107) (8.8)%\nServices and software 28 29 (1) (3.4)% 84 83 1 1.2 %\nTotal Net sales 410 324 86 26.5 % 1,199 1,305 (106) (8.1)%\nGross profit 199 145 54 37.2 % 570 628 (58) (9.2)%\nGross margin 48.5 % 44.8 % 370 bps 47.5 % 48.1 % (60) bps\nOperating expenses 116 101 15 14.9 % 338 341 (3) (0.9)%\nOperating income $ 83 $ 44 $ 39 88.6 % $ 232 $ 287 $ (55) (19.2)%\nAIT Organic Net sales growth (decline):\n24\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 28, 2024\nAIT Reported GAAP Net sales growth (decline) 26.5 % (8.1)%\nAdjustments:\nImpact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.7)% (0.6)%\nAIT Organic Net sales growth (decline) (2) 25.8 % (8.7)%\n(1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt\nand other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The\nfollowing table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions):\n26\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30,\nCash flow provided by (used in): 2024 2023 $ Change\nOperating activities $ 707 $ (145) $ 852\nInvesting activities (42) (49) 7\nFinancing activities (127) 140 (267)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash balances — (2) 2\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 538 $ (56) $ 594\nThe change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the\nfollowing:\n• $852 million change in operating activities primarily due to lower cash payments for inventory purchases and the reduction of overall inventory levels,\nlower income tax, legal settlement, and employee incentive compensation payments, higher cash receipts on interest rate swaps attributed to the\ntermination of those agreements, as well as overall improved operating profits.\n• $267 million change in financing activities primarily due to current year net debt repayments as a portion of the recently issued Senior Notes was\nutilized to reduce total debt, compared to net borrowings in the prior year.\nCompany Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm Loan A $ 1,575 $ 1,684\nSenior Notes 500 —\nRevolving Credit Facility — 413\nReceivables Financing Facilities 108 129\nTotal debt $ 2,183 $ 2,226\nLess: Debt issuance costs (11) (2)\nLess: Unamortized discounts (3) (4)\nLess: Current portion of debt (89) (173)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,080 $ 2,047\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in the second quarter of 2026 and the majority due upon\nmaturity in 2027.

The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the\nreceivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating\nactivities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from\nfinancing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were a total of $7 million and $56 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold\nand removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $77 million and $112 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such\nobligations reflected within Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Note 15, Accounts Receivable Factoring in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nShare Repurchases\nOn May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an incremental $1 billion of its\noutstanding shares of common stock. This authorization augments the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization which was announced on July 30,\n2019. The May 2022 share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed its original\nauthorization of $1 billion in share repurchases. The level of the Company’s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition,\ncapital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and\nnature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any\ntime. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company repurchased 50,304 shares of common stock for\napproximately $16 million. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 459,318 shares of common stock for approximately $123\nmillion, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the May 2022 program of $877 million.\n28\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Customers\nEnd-users of our products, solutions and services are diversified across a wide variety of industries. We have three customers, who are distributors of the\nCompany’s products and solutions, that individually accounted for more than 10% of our Net sales for the periods presented.

No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total Net sales\nduring the period ended September 28, 2024.\nSafe Harbor\nForward-looking statements contained in this filing are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are highly\ndependent upon a variety of important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking\nstatements. When used in this document and documents referenced, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” and “expect” and similar\nexpressions as they relate to the Company or its management are intended to identify such forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of\nidentifying these statements. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company’s financial outlook for full year of 2024. These\nforward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the\nCompany’s industry, market conditions, general domestic and international economic conditions, and other factors. These factors include:\n• Market acceptance of the Company’s products, services and solution offerings and competitors’ offerings and the potential effects of emerging\ntechnologies and changes in customer requirements,\n• The effect of global market conditions, including the North America; EMEA; Latin America; and Asia-Pacific regions in which we do business,\n• The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, customs duties and trade policies due to the large percentage of our sales and operations being\noutside the U.S.,\n• Our ability to control manufacturing and operating costs,\n• Risks related to the manufacturing of the Company’s products and conducting business operations in non-U.S. countries, including the risk of\ndepending on key suppliers who are also in non-U.S. countries,\n• The Company’s ability to purchase sufficient materials, parts, and components, our ability to provide services, software, and products to meet\ncustomer demand, particularly in light of global economic conditions,\n• The availability of credit and the volatility of capital markets, which may affect our suppliers, customers, and ourselves,\n• Success of integrating acquisitions,\n• Our ability to attract, retain, develop, and motivate key personnel,\n• Interest rate and financial market conditions,\n• Access to cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S.,\n• The effect of natural disasters, man-made disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and cybersecurity incidents on our business,\n• The impact of changes in foreign and domestic governmental policies, laws, or regulations,\n• The outcome of litigation in which the Company may be involved, particularly litigation or claims related to infringement of third-party intellectual\nproperty rights, and\n• The outcome of any future tax matters or tax law changes.\nWe encourage readers of this report to review Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report for further discussion of issues that could affect the Company’s\nfuture results. We undertake no obligation, other than as may be required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a\nresult of new information, future events, changed circumstances, or any other reason after the date of this report.\n29\nTable of Contents\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures – Consolidated Organic Net sales growth, AIT Organic Net sales growth (decline), and EVM Organic Net\nsales growth – are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and\nforeign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective\nand insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These\nsupplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in\nconjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere were no material changes in the Company’s market risk during the quarter ended September 28, 2024. For additional information on market risk, refer to\nItem 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Report on Disclosure Controls\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and\ncommunicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as of September 28, 2024. Based on this assessment and\nthose criteria, our management believes that, as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended September 28, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\ncontrols will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and\nthe benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Zebra have\nbeen prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and\nthere can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of\ncontrols effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the\ndegree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 11, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n31\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the factors identified under “Safe Harbor” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the\nonly risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial also\nmay materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and/or operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in\nour Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as described below.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n• We may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness;\n• Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n• We may be unable to create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n• Our subsidiary guarantors may not have sufficient assets or cash flow to allow them to guarantee new debt and existing debt;\n• We may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including\nincreased competition; and\n• We may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business.\nAny or all of the above events or factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The risks that we face based on our\noutstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and\nto pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers, which will be\naffected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets\nwhere we operate and pressure from competitors.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay\nour indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell\nassets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition,\nwe may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our\nindebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could\nbe at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of anticipated\nor future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts\noutstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay\nborrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our\nindebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default\nor declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. As a result,\nany default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and could impact our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of\nour indebtedness. In addition, an event of default would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital\non commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected. Our business processes\ndepend on our IT systems, and the IT systems and processes of third parties to provide solutions and services, maintain financial records, retain sensitive data\nsuch as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, suppliers, and business partners, process orders, manage\ninventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Disruptions to our IT systems from system failures, shutdowns, implementation\nof new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server,\nsystems, and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt order processing and shipments, damage customer and\nbusiness partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating\nresults and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such events will be successful.\n32\nTable of Contents\nDefects or errors in the Company’s software products, or third party software included in or upon which our products, solutions and services rely, could harm\nour reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products. Our software, third party software included on our products,\nsolutions or services, or servers and infrastructure may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. Although we have not suffered significant harm from any\nerrors, defects, or bugs, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. Any\nfuture errors, defects, or bugs found in such software, solutions, services or infrastructure may result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products,\nsolutions or services; inability to deliver our products, solutions or services; diversion of resources; injury to reputation; increased service and warranty\nexpenses; and payment of damages; which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n33\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

This authorization augments the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization which was announced on July 30, 2019. In the fourth\nquarter of 2022, the Company completed its original authorization of $1 billion in share repurchases. Repurchases may be affected from time to time\nthrough open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 459,318 shares of common stock for approximately $123 million, resulting\nin a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the May 2022 program of $877 million.\nItem 5.

The data shows shoppers aren’t the only ones who are worried about the impact of theft and crime on the in-store experience. Eight in 10 retail associates are concerned about the lack of technology deployed to spot safety threats or criminal activity. \n\n![Zebra Technologies' 17th Annual Global Shopper Study reveals how retailers are adapting to evolving shopper expectations, leveraging technology and tackling key challenges to create meaningful connections and deliver exceptional experiences. \\(Graphic: Zebra\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241113425132/en/2303830/4/Zebra_graphic.jpg)\n\nZebra Technologies' 17th Annual Global Shopper Study reveals how retailers are adapting to evolving shopper expectations, leveraging technology and tackling key challenges to create meaningful connections and deliver exceptional experiences. (Graphic: Zebra)\n\nWith most retailers (78%) under high pressure to minimize theft and loss, they are now investing in technology tools that can help frontline workers and those watching operations from behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are currently viewed as the most helpful with loss prevention, closely followed by cameras, sensors, and RFID. While only 38% of retailers currently use AI-based prescriptive analytics for loss prevention, 50% say they plan to use it in the next 1-3 years for this purpose. Over four in 10 retailers say they also plan to use self-checkout cameras and sensors (45%), computer vision (46%), and RFID tags and readers (42%) within the next three years, specifically for loss prevention. \n\nThis should come as a relief to shoppers, as 78% say it’s annoying when products are locked up or secured within cases. Adding to that frustration is that it’s hard to find an associate while shopping in stores these days, according to 70% of consumers. \n\nOne in five shoppers who left a store without getting what they needed say it’s because a retail associate wasn’t available to help, an increase over the past two years. \n\n**Other Issues Contributing to Associate Frustration, Decline in Shopper Satisfaction**\n\nAlthough consumers are still generally satisfied with their shopping experience and global [consumer spending](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnrf.com%2Fcnbc%2Fnrf-retail-monitor&esheet=54151516&newsitemid=20241113425132&lan=en-US&anchor=consumer+spending&index=3&md5=49192dd47b0ebe5f77fd8ef2448cf7fb) is holding steady, fewer shoppers overall are satisfied with their shopping experiences this year. In 2023, 85% were satisfied with both the in-store and online experiences. This year, only 81% are satisfied with the in-store experience and 79% with online shopping. \n\nShoppers expect retailers to offer easy click-and-collect and returns options, yet retailers and associates admit challenges with both. Most retailers also say it’s a struggle to confirm current inventory and pricing. Plus, with more shoppers returning to stores, lingering labor shortages and increasing loss incidents are having a greater impact on service levels. For example: \n\n  * 78% of shoppers say self-checkout options improve their shopping experience, yet 68% of shoppers say self-checkout (SCO) lanes are lacking, with some reporting they have left a store without making a purchase because there were no SCO or contactless payment options. \n  * 71% of shoppers are concerned about the lack of help associates can offer, while 82% of associates say it’s even difficult for them to find help or ask for timely support when needed. \n\n\n\nNearly 90% of retail associates believe they can provide a better customer experience when they have mobile technology tools to help simplify real-time communication and prioritize tasks as well as check prices and inventory. Most retailers agree technology enables associates to do their jobs better, and as a result, 75% of retailers say they plan to increase their technology investments in 2025. \n\n“Many retailers are laying the groundwork to build a modern store experience,” said Matt Guiste, Global Retail Technology Strategist, Zebra Technologies. “They are investing in mobile and intelligent automation technologies to help inform operational decisions and enable associates to do the things that keep shoppers happy.” \n\nAlong with enhancing the customer experience, the study shows retailers’ top priorities include improving mobile workforce efficiency and productivity along with inventory management. More than one-third of them (39%) believe that GenAI will have an extremely significant impact on inventory management and demand forecasting. They will also be automating product locating and item-level RFID (46%), video monitoring (45%), and stock-out alerts (45%) to give associates and shoppers real-time inventory visibility, which is a leading profitability driver. \n\n**How Retailers Can Recover from the Year-Over-Year Decline in Shopper Satisfaction**\n\nRetailers can exceed shopper expectations, drive profitability and empower engaged associates if they: \n\n  * **Get to know their customers.** Three-quarters (75%) of shoppers are more willing to try and buy items when retailers know their personal preferences and associates make recommendations. \n  * **Make it easier to find, pay for, and return items and find item-related information.** Shoppers want associates to be available, and they are driven to retailers who can help them more easily find or return items. \n  * **Keep shelves stocked** . While fewer shoppers are complaining about out-of-stocks, this remains the top reason why over half (57%) of shoppers leave a store without items they want, and more associates (86%) are now struggling with real-time out-of-stock tracking. \n  * **Protect shoppers without over-indexing on loss prevention** . Most shoppers (71%) are concerned the stores at which they shop are experiencing high levels of theft and crime. Like associates, they worry threats can’t be spotted or stopped. However, 77% of shoppers are also concerned retailers may raise prices to cover the cost of increasing theft and crime. \n  * **Avoid passing operational costs onto customers.** Shoppers are more price sensitive than ever, with over three-quarters (+75%) worried inflation will drive up the prices of both everyday essentials and big-ticket items and force them to reduce overall spending. \n  * **Give associates more technology.** Most associates (85%) feel strongly that their store needs more associates, and 81% of retailers agree. Associates also believe stores that leverage retail technology and mobile devices attract and retain more associates, and shoppers have a better experience when associates use the latest technology to assist them. \n\n\n\n**KEY REGIONAL FINDINGS**\n\n**Asia Pacific (APAC)**\n\n  * 80% of decision-makers plan to boost investments in supply chain, outpacing the global average. \n\n\n\n**Latin America**\n\n  * 66% of shoppers leave stores without all the items they need, the highest of any region. \n\n\n\n**North America**\n\n  * More decision-makers (57%) noted an increase in retail shrink rates in the past 12 months than their counterparts around the world. \n\n\n\n**Europe**\n\n  * Nearly six in 10 retail decision-makers plan to use RFID tags and sensors in the next five years. \n\n\n\n**ABOUT THE 17 th ANNUAL GLOBAL SHOPPER STUDY **\n\nZebra Technologies commissioned a global research study among adult shoppers (age 18+), decision-makers, and associates to analyze the trends and technologies transforming the retail sector. Administered online by Azure Knowledge Corporation, this year’s study includes over 4,200 respondents across topics of shopper experience, device and technology usage, delivery and fulfillment in store and online. Zebra’s 17 th Annual Global Shopper Study reports on the attitudes, opinions, and expectations shaping the industry’s future. The series focuses on three key themes: Beyond Expectations, Driving Profitability, and The Power of Engaged Associates.

Asset Intelligence & Tracking (\"AIT\") segment net sales were $410 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $324 million in the prior year. Consolidated organic net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 30.6% year-over-year, with a 33.0% increase in the EVM segment and a 25.8% increase in the AIT segment. \n\nThird quarter 2024 gross profit was $613 million compared to $427 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.7% in the prior year due to volume leverage and business mix. Adjusted gross margin was 49.1% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44.8% in the prior year. \n\nOperating expenses decreased to $422 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $439 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Adjusted operating expenses increased to $364 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $334 million in the prior year. \n\nIn the third quarter, the company completed the actions under its previously announced Exit and Restructuring Plans generating approximately $120 million of net annualized cost savings primarily within Operating expenses, of which, the Company has realized $110 million in net savings to date. \n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $137 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $15 million, or $0.28 loss per diluted share, in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income increased to $181 million for the third quarter of 2024, or $3.49 per diluted share, compared to $45 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the prior year. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $268 million, or 21.4% of adjusted net sales, compared to $111 million, or 11.6% of adjusted net sales in the prior year primarily due to higher gross margins and lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $676 million and total debt of $2,183 million. \n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $707 million and the Company invested $41 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $666 million. The Company also had net debt payments of $43 million and share repurchases of $16 million in the first nine months of 2024. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects fourth quarter sales growth between 28% and 31% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency translation is expected to have approximately a 1 percentage point favorable impact. \n\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 22%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.00. This assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 17%. \n\nFree cash flow for the full year is expected to be at least $850 million. \n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure as discussed under the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" caption below. This would include items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Conference Call Notification**\n\nInvestors are invited to listen to a live webcast of Zebra’s conference call regarding the Company’s financial results.

Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the company’s forward-looking statements. These statements represent estimates only as of the date they were made. Zebra undertakes no obligation, other than as may be required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason after the date of this release. \n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in Zebra’s industry, market conditions, general domestic and international economic conditions, and other factors. These factors include customer acceptance of Zebra’s offerings and competitors' offerings, and the potential effects of emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. The effect of global market conditions, and the availability of credit and capital markets volatility may have adverse effects on Zebra, its suppliers and its customers. In addition, natural disasters, man-made disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and cybersecurity incidents may have negative effects on Zebra's business and results of operations. Zebra's ability to purchase sufficient materials, parts, and components, and ability to provide services, software and products to meet customer demand could negatively impact Zebra's results of operations and customer relationships. Profits and profitability will be affected by Zebra’s ability to control manufacturing and operating costs. Because of its debt, interest rates and financial market conditions may also have an adverse impact on results. Foreign exchange rates, customs duties and trade policies may have an adverse effect on financial results because of the large percentage of Zebra's international sales. The impacts of changes in foreign and domestic governmental policies, regulations, or laws, as well as the outcome of litigation or tax matters in which Zebra may be involved are other factors that could adversely affect Zebra's business and results of operations. The success of integrating acquisitions could also adversely affect profitability, reported results and the company’s competitive position in its industry. These and other factors could have an adverse effect on Zebra’s sales, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of Zebra's financial results. When used in this release and documents referenced, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook,” and “expect” and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements. Descriptions of certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect the company’s future operations and results can be found in Zebra’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains certain Non-GAAP financial measures, consisting of “adjusted net sales,” “adjusted gross profit,” “adjusted gross margin,” “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA % of adjusted net sales,” “Non-GAAP net income,” “Non-GAAP earnings per share,” “Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share,” “free cash flow,” “organic net sales,” “organic net sales growth,” “organic net sales growth (decline),” “organic net sales (decline) growth,” and “adjusted operating expenses.” Management presents these measures to focus on the on-going operations and believes it is useful to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant items, as a means to understand the performance of its ongoing operations and how management views the business. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables and accompanying disclosures at the end of this press release for more detailed information regarding non-GAAP financial measures herein, including the items reflected in adjusted net earnings calculations. These measures, however, should not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Outlook” above) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. \n\nAs a global company, Zebra's operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which the company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar; accordingly, the company presents certain organic growth financial information, which includes impacts of foreign currency translation, to provide a framework to assess how the company’s businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. In addition, the company excludes the impact of its foreign currency hedging program in the prior year periods. The company believes these measures should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of the company’s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION
