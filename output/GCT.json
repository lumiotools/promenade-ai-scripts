With this appointment, the Board’s membership remains at five.\n\nCurrently the Head of GigaCloud’s newly launched BaaS Program, Bernes was the Founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Noble House Home Furnishings LLC.

He will contribute his expertise to the Board upon his appointment, effective November 11, 2024.\n\n“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank Hurst for his services,” said Larry Wu, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Hurst’s insightful advice and perspectives, especially during the founding years of the Company, have proven to be invaluable. We wish him all the best.”\n\nOn November 6, 2024, Lin notified the Company of his intention to retire from the Board, effective immediately. As a general partner at DCM, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that specializes in investing in early-stage technology companies, Lin cited his desire to return to focusing on guiding pre-IPO, emerging portfolio companies as the principal reason for his decision to retire from the Board.
