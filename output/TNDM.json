(Nasdaq: TNDM), a global insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and increased sales guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Worldwide GAAP sales increased 31 percent to $244.0 million compared to third quarter 2023; worldwide non-GAAP sales(1) increased 25 percent to $242.9 million compared to third quarter 2023. \n  * Grew worldwide pump shipments by more than 25 percent compared to third quarter 2023. \n  * Achieved year-over-year growth in new pump starts in the United States, including growth in new customers starting from multiple daily injections. \n  * Demonstrated positive Adjusted EBITDA and a return to positive free cash flow. \n  * Completed clinical study in support of a regulatory filing to expand the indication for Control-IQ to include people living with type 2 diabetes. \n\n\n\n“The third quarter marked a milestone achievement for Tandem Diabetes Care as we delivered the highest quarterly sales in our Company’s history, both in the U.S. and internationally,” said John Sheridan, president and chief executive officer. “This performance, coupled with our strong operational execution, positions us well to achieve our remaining goals for 2024 and beyond, as we further our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Sales Results Compared to 2023**\n\nFrom September 2022 through February 2024, the Company offered the Tandem Choice Program (Tandem Choice) to eligible t:slim X2 customers to provide a pathway to ownership of Tandem Mobi, for a fee when available. At the end of the second quarter, the Company began offering eligible t:slim X2 owners the opportunity to switch to a Tandem Mobi under the terms of Tandem Choice. As a result of this program, the Company is providing select financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Additional information, including the accounting treatment of this program and other non-GAAP measures, can be found under Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. \n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 ,** |  **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**_($ in millions)_** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-** **GAAP(1)** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-** **GAAP(1)** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-** **GAAP(1)** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-** **GAAP(1)**  \nUnited States |  $  |  171.7  |  $  |  170.6  |  $  |  130.2  |  $  |  138.5  |  $  |  458.1  |  $  |  458.0  |  $  |  404.0  |  $  |  416.5   \nOutside United States |  72.3  |  72.3  |  55.4  |  55.4  |  199.5  |  199.5  |  146.9  |  146.9   \n**Total Worldwide** |  **$** |  **244.0** |  **$** |  **242.9** |  **$** |  **185.6** |  **$** |  **193.9** |  **$** |  **657.6** |  **$** |  **657.5** |  **$** |  **550.9** |  **$** |  **563.4**  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Additional Results Compared to Third Quarter 2023**\n\n  * **Sales:** In the United States, GAAP sales included $1.0 million incremental sales relating to Tandem Choice compared to a sales deferral of $8.2 million. Non-GAAP sales exclude Tandem Choice-related sales deferrals or recognition. Shipments in the United States were approximately 21,000 pumps, which does not include pumps fulfilled under Tandem Choice. Shipments outside the United States were nearly 11,000 pumps. \n\n\n  * **Gross profit:** GAAP gross profit was $124.7 million, compared to $89.8 million. GAAP gross margin was 51 percent compared to 48 percent. Non-GAAP gross profit(1) was $124.3 million compared to $98.0 million. Non-GAAP gross margin(1) was 51 percent in both periods. \n\n\n  * **Operating loss:** GAAP operating loss was $26.1 million, or negative 11 percent of sales, compared to $31.5 million, or negative 17 percent of sales. Non-GAAP operating loss(1) was $26.5 million, or negative 11 percent of sales, compared to $23.3 million, or negative 12 percent of sales. \n\n\n  * **Net loss:** GAAP net loss was $23.3 million, compared to $33.0 million. Non-GAAP net loss(1) was $23.6 million compared to $24.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $4.0 million, or 2 percent of sales, compared to $1.5 million, or 1 percent of sales. \n\n\n\n(1) A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and additional information can be found in Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. Also see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information. \n\nSee tables for additional financial information. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 is set forth below. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high degree of complexity in the accounting treatment for the Tandem Choice program. For a description of non-GAAP sales, non-GAAP gross margin, and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as an illustration of the reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, refer to Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. Also see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information. \n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2024, the Company is increasing 2024 sales guidance and reaffirming other financial guidance as follows: \n\n  * Non-GAAP sales are estimated to be approximately $903 million to $910 million for the full year. \n    * Sales in the United States of $645 million to $650 million. \n    * Sales outside the United States of approximately $258 million to $260 million. \n  * Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 51 percent. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin is estimated to be breakeven as a percent of sales. \n  * Non-cash charges included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $120 million. This includes: \n    * Approximately $100 million non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. \n    * Approximately $20 million depreciation and amortization expense. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this press release to provide information that may assist investors in understanding the Company’s financial results and assessing its prospects for future performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important operating performance indicators because they exclude items that are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, the Company’s core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to the Company. These non-GAAP financial results are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in the future, they will be calculated using a consistent method from period to period. A reconciliation of each of the historical GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. \n\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception set forth in the applicable regulations, because there is substantial uncertainty associated with predicting any future adjustments that may be made to the Company’s GAAP financial measures in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for Tandem Choice has a high degree of complexity. In September 2022 when the program was launched, the Company began deferring a portion of sales for each eligible t:slim X2 pump shipped in the United States. When a customer elects to participate in Tandem Choice, the Company will recognize the existing deferral, incremental fees received and the associated costs of providing the new insulin pump at the time of fulfillment. The timing of recognition will be based on either a) an affirmative election to participate in Tandem Choice or b) expiration of the right to participate at program expiration, provided all obligation under the Tandem Choice program are satisfied. \n\nNotably: \n\n  * Offering the program does not impact the economics associated with how or when the initial pump sale is reimbursed. \n  * Customer eligibility for Tandem Choice was automatic at the time of a t:slim X2 purchase. Customer eligibility ended in February 2024 with the commercial availability of Tandem Mobi. \n  * Qualifying customers were able to elect participation in Tandem Choice starting at the end of the second quarter of 2024. \n  * An affirmative election is required for the customer to participate in Tandem Choice, at which time any customer fees will be received and recognized as a sale. Any remaining deferrals are expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024. The balance of the Tandem Choice deferral was $30.1 million as of September 30, 2024. \n  * The expiration date of Tandem Choice is December 31, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast today at 4:30pm Eastern Time (1:30pm Pacific Time).

(Nasdaq: TNDM), a global insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and increased sales guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Worldwide GAAP sales increased 31 percent to $244.0 million compared to third quarter 2023; worldwide non-GAAP sales(1) increased 25 percent to $242.9 million compared to third quarter 2023. \n  * Grew worldwide pump shipments by more than 25 percent compared to third quarter 2023. \n  * Achieved year-over-year growth in new pump starts in the United States, including growth in new customers starting from multiple daily injections. \n  * Demonstrated positive Adjusted EBITDA and a return to positive free cash flow. \n  * Completed clinical study in support of a regulatory filing to expand the indication for Control-IQ to include people living with type 2 diabetes. \n\n\n\n“The third quarter marked a milestone achievement for Tandem Diabetes Care as we delivered the highest quarterly sales in our Company’s history, both in the U.S. and internationally,” said John Sheridan, president and chief executive officer. “This performance, coupled with our strong operational execution, positions us well to achieve our remaining goals for 2024 and beyond, as we further our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Sales Results Compared to 2023**\n\nFrom September 2022 through February 2024, the Company offered the Tandem Choice Program (Tandem Choice) to eligible t:slim X2 customers to provide a pathway to ownership of Tandem Mobi, for a fee when available. At the end of the second quarter, the Company began offering eligible t:slim X2 owners the opportunity to switch to a Tandem Mobi under the terms of Tandem Choice. As a result of this program, the Company is providing select financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Additional information, including the accounting treatment of this program and other non-GAAP measures, can be found under Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release.

Non-GAAP sales exclude Tandem Choice-related sales deferrals or recognition. Shipments in the United States were approximately 21,000 pumps, which does not include pumps fulfilled under Tandem Choice. Shipments outside the United States were nearly 11,000 pumps. \n\n\n  * **Gross profit:** GAAP gross profit was $124.7 million, compared to $89.8 million. GAAP gross margin was 51 percent compared to 48 percent. Non-GAAP gross profit(1) was $124.3 million compared to $98.0 million. Non-GAAP gross margin(1) was 51 percent in both periods. \n\n\n  * **Operating loss:** GAAP operating loss was $26.1 million, or negative 11 percent of sales, compared to $31.5 million, or negative 17 percent of sales. Non-GAAP operating loss(1) was $26.5 million, or negative 11 percent of sales, compared to $23.3 million, or negative 12 percent of sales. \n\n\n  * **Net loss:** GAAP net loss was $23.3 million, compared to $33.0 million. Non-GAAP net loss(1) was $23.6 million compared to $24.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $4.0 million, or 2 percent of sales, compared to $1.5 million, or 1 percent of sales. \n\n\n\n(1) A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and additional information can be found in Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. Also see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information. \n\nSee tables for additional financial information. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 is set forth below. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high degree of complexity in the accounting treatment for the Tandem Choice program. For a description of non-GAAP sales, non-GAAP gross margin, and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as an illustration of the reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, refer to Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. Also see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information. \n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2024, the Company is increasing 2024 sales guidance and reaffirming other financial guidance as follows: \n\n  * Non-GAAP sales are estimated to be approximately $903 million to $910 million for the full year. \n    * Sales in the United States of $645 million to $650 million. \n    * Sales outside the United States of approximately $258 million to $260 million. \n  * Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 51 percent. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin is estimated to be breakeven as a percent of sales. \n  * Non-cash charges included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $120 million. This includes: \n    * Approximately $100 million non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. \n    * Approximately $20 million depreciation and amortization expense. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this press release to provide information that may assist investors in understanding the Company’s financial results and assessing its prospects for future performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important operating performance indicators because they exclude items that are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, the Company’s core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to the Company. These non-GAAP financial results are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in the future, they will be calculated using a consistent method from period to period. A reconciliation of each of the historical GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in Table D “Reconciliation of GAAP versus Non-GAAP Financial Results” attached to this press release. \n\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception set forth in the applicable regulations, because there is substantial uncertainty associated with predicting any future adjustments that may be made to the Company’s GAAP financial measures in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for Tandem Choice has a high degree of complexity. In September 2022 when the program was launched, the Company began deferring a portion of sales for each eligible t:slim X2 pump shipped in the United States. When a customer elects to participate in Tandem Choice, the Company will recognize the existing deferral, incremental fees received and the associated costs of providing the new insulin pump at the time of fulfillment. The timing of recognition will be based on either a) an affirmative election to participate in Tandem Choice or b) expiration of the right to participate at program expiration, provided all obligation under the Tandem Choice program are satisfied. \n\nNotably: \n\n  * Offering the program does not impact the economics associated with how or when the initial pump sale is reimbursed. \n  * Customer eligibility for Tandem Choice was automatic at the time of a t:slim X2 purchase. Customer eligibility ended in February 2024 with the commercial availability of Tandem Mobi. \n  * Qualifying customers were able to elect participation in Tandem Choice starting at the end of the second quarter of 2024. \n  * An affirmative election is required for the customer to participate in Tandem Choice, at which time any customer fees will be received and recognized as a sale. Any remaining deferrals are expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024. The balance of the Tandem Choice deferral was $30.1 million as of September 30, 2024. \n  * The expiration date of Tandem Choice is December 31, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast today at 4:30pm Eastern Time (1:30pm Pacific Time).
