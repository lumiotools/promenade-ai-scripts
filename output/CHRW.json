Robinson Reports 2024 Third Quarter Results\nEden Prairie, MN, October 30, 2024 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (Nasdaq:\nCHRW) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter Highlights:\n• Significant year-over-year increase in profitability, driven by strong execution, disciplined\nvolume growth and improvement in gross profit, productivity and operating leverage\n• Gross profits increased 15.5% to $723.8 million\n• Income from operations increased 58.7% to $180.1 million\n• Adjusted operating margin(1) increased 660 basis points to 24.5%\n• Adjusted operating margin, excluding restructuring and loss on divestiture(1), increased 1,120\nbasis points to 32.9%\n• Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 17.6% to $0.80\n• Adjusted EPS(1) increased 45.5% to $1.28\n• Cash generated by operations decreased by $97.2 million to $108.1 million provided by\noperations, due to an increase in net operating working capital related to higher ocean rates\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin, adjusted operating margin, excluding restructuring and loss on divestiture, and adjusted EPS are\nnon-GAAP financial measures. The same factors described in this release that impacted these non-GAAP measures also\nimpacted the comparable GAAP measures. Refer to pages 11 through 13 for further discussion and GAAP to Non-GAAP\nReconciliations.\n\"I’m pleased with our third quarter results that reflect continued improvement in our execution, as we\ncontinue to deploy our new operating model. We are raising the bar, even in a historically prolonged\nfreight recession, with strong execution and disciplined volume growth across divisions while delivering\nexceptional service for our customers and carriers,\" said C.H. Robinson's President and Chief Executive\n1\nOfficer, Dave Bozeman. \"I want to thank our people, one of our greatest competitive advantages, for their\nrelentless efforts to embrace our new operating model and execute in a fit, fast and focused way so we can\nkeep pushing that bar higher.\"\n\"Due to a focus on constantly testing market conditions and optimizing yield, we improved the quality of\nour volume in the third quarter and continued to expand our NAST gross profit margin. We also continued\nto push our efficiency to higher levels in both NAST and Global Forwarding, and we remain on track to\ndeliver greater than 30% compound growth in productivity over the two-year period from the end of 2022\nto end of 2024.\"\n\"Our new operating model has changed how we discover and inspect root cause issues and quickly\nimplement countermeasures to improve the level of our operational execution. The reliability of our\noperating reviews continues to increase, as we leverage our data rich environment to inform our decision\nmaking and enhance our competitive differentiation,\" said Bozeman. \"At an organizational level, we\ncontinue to cascade the operating model deeper into the organization and build operational muscle at\nvarious levels of the enterprise to deliver on our strategic roadmap. As part of this effort, an evolving\ntoolkit is being used by our employees in the form of problem resolution, balanced scorecard reviews,\ndaily management, and value stream mapping, to name a few.\"\n\"Empowering our people with the Robinson operating model is creating a flywheel of performance, talent\ndevelopment and accountability that is evolving our culture to be driven by progress, execution and\nproactive problem identification and resolution. This is showing up in improvements such as more\ndisciplined pricing and better decisions on the volume that we’re seeking. We are still early in our journey,\nbut the operating model is helping us execute a solid strategy even better, and we expect further\nimprovement as our team continues to embrace this new way of operating. As I’ve said before, I know\nfrom my past experiences of implementing Lean operating models that improvement isn’t always linear.\nBut I’m confident in the team’s willingness and ability to drive a higher and more consistent level of\ndiscipline in our operational execution,\" Bozeman concluded.\n2\nSummary of Third Quarter of 2024 Results Compared to the Third Quarter of 2023\n• Total revenues increased 7.0% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing and volume in our\nocean services, partially offset by lower pricing and volume in truckload services.\n• Gross profits increased 15.5% to $723.8 million. Adjusted gross profits increased 15.8% to\n$735.3 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction in our ocean and\ntruckload services.\n• Operating expenses increased 6.5% to $555.1 million. Personnel expenses increased 5.2% to\n$361.6 million, primarily due to higher variable compensation, partially offset by cost optimization\nefforts. Average employee headcount declined 9.6%. Other selling, general and administrative\n(“SG&A”) expenses increased 8.9% to $193.6 million, primarily due to a $57.0 million loss on the\nplanned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. The prior year included $21.4\nmillion of restructuring expenses, primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in Argentina. In\naddition, other SG&A expenses decreased across several expense categories in the current year.\n• Income from operations totaled $180.1 million, up 58.7% due to the increase in adjusted gross\nprofits, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin(1) of 24.5%\nincreased 660 basis points.\n• Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $36.3 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.1 million of interest expense, which increased $0.2 million versus last year, and a $15.1 million\nnet loss from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.\n• The effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.4%, compared to 11.7% in the third quarter last year. The\nhigher rate in the third quarter of this year was driven by the impact of higher pre-tax income and non-\nrecurring discrete items in the quarter, partially offset by increased tax benefit related to stock-based\ncompensation and higher U.S. tax credits.\n• Net income totaled $97.2 million, up 18.6% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $0.80 increased 17.6%.\nAdjusted EPS(1) of $1.28 increased 45.5%.\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. The same factors described in this release\nthat impacted these non-GAAP measures also impacted the comparable GAAP measures.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nThird quarter total revenues for the NAST segment totaled $2.9 billion, a decrease of 4.9% over the prior\nyear, primarily driven by lower truckload pricing, reflecting an oversupply of truckload capacity compared\nto freight demand. NAST adjusted gross profits increased 8.8% in the quarter to $420.7 million. Adjusted\ngross profits in truckload increased 16.6% due to a 21.0% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment,\npartially offset by a 3.5% decrease in truckload shipments. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile\ncharged to our customers, which excludes fuel surcharges, increased approximately 2.5% in the quarter\ncompared to the prior year, while truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, also\ndecreased 0.5%, resulting in a 21.5% increase in truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. LTL adjusted\ngross profits increased 3.7% versus the year-ago period, driven by a 2.5% increase in LTL volume and a\n1.0% increase in adjusted gross profit per order. NAST overall volume increased modestly for the quarter.\nOperating expenses decreased 0.9%, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and lower credit losses,\nwhich were partially offset by higher variable compensation. NAST average employee headcount was\ndown 10.9% in the quarter. Income from operations increased 32.7% to $148.8 million, and adjusted\noperating margin expanded 640 basis points to 35.4%.\n5\nGlobal Forwarding Results\nSummarized financial results of our Global Forwarding segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 1,141,190 $ 719,045 58.7 % $ 2,921,050 $ 2,288,890 27.6 %\nAdjusted gross profits(1) 234,636 169,893 38.1 % 598,748 527,043 13.6 %\nIncome from operations 88,115 3,491 N/M 160,649 63,254 154.0 %\n____________________________________________\n(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nThird quarter total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment increased 58.7% to $1.1 billion, primarily\ndriven by higher pricing and volume in our ocean services. Adjusted gross profits increased 38.1% in the\nquarter to $234.6 million. Ocean adjusted gross profits increased 57.4%, driven by a 47.0% increase in\nadjusted gross profit per shipment and a 7.0% increase in shipments. Air adjusted gross profits increased\n11.4%, driven by a 20.0% increase in metric tons shipped, partially offset by a 7.0% decrease in adjusted\ngross profit per metric ton shipped. Customs adjusted gross profits increased 13.5%, driven by both a\n7.0% increase in adjusted gross profit per transaction and a 6.5% increase in transaction volume.\nOperating expenses decreased 11.9%, primarily due to a $23.6 million of restructuring expenses in the\nprior year, primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in Argentina, and due to cost optimization\nefforts in the current year. Third quarter average employee headcount decreased 10.4%. Income from\noperations increased to $88.1 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 3,550 basis points to\n37.6% in the quarter.\n6\nAll Other and Corporate Results\nTotal revenues and adjusted gross profits for Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Other Surface\nTransportation are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 568,834 $ 535,015 6.3 % $ 1,694,411 $ 1,615,241 4.9 %\nAdjusted gross profits(1):\nRobinson Fresh $ 36,708 $ 31,083 18.1 % $ 110,327 $ 100,123 10.2 %\nManaged Services 27,949 29,427 (5.0) % 85,637 87,350 (2.0) %\nOther Surface Transportation 15,296 17,936 (14.7) % 48,248 57,772 (16.5) %\n____________________________________________\n(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nThird quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 18.1% to $36.7 million due to an increase in\nintegrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. Managed Services adjusted gross\nprofits decreased 5.0% due to lower transaction volume. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross\nprofits decreased 14.7% to $15.3 million, primarily due to a 17.0% decrease in Europe truckload adjusted\ngross profits.\nOther Income Statement Items\nInterest and other income/expense, net totaled $36.3 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.1 million of interest expense, which increased $0.2 million versus the third quarter of 2023 and a\n$15.1 million net loss from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.\nThe third quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%, up from 11.7% last year. The higher rate in the third\nquarter of this year was driven by the impact of higher pre-tax income and non-recurring discrete items in\nthe quarter, partially offset by increased tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and higher U.S.\ntax credits. For 2024, we now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be 18% to 20%.\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were up 1.2%.\n7\nCash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution\nCash generated from operations totaled $108.1 million in the third quarter, compared to $205.2 million of\ncash generated from operations in the third quarter of 2023. The $97.2 million decrease in cash flow from\noperations was primarily related to a $190.0 million decline in cash provided by changes in net operating\nworking capital, due to a $165.5 million sequential increase in net operating working capital in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to a $24.5 million sequential decrease in the third quarter of 2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, cash returned to shareholders totaled $77.1 million, with $73.0 million in cash\ndividends and $4.1 million in repurchases of common stock.\nCapital expenditures totaled $17.3 million in the quarter.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding\namortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe\nadjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by\nthird parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of\nour results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profit.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization\nof internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit\ndivided by total revenues. We believe adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures of our ability to source, add value, and sell services\nand products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement.

Robinson Reports 2024 Second Quarter Results\nEden Prairie, MN, July 31, 2024 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (Nasdaq: CHRW)\ntoday reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nSecond Quarter Key Metrics:\n• Gross profits increased 3.0% year-over-year to $676.5 million, and increased 4.5% sequentially\n• Income from operations increased 34.3% year-over-year to $178.1 million, and increased 40.1%\nsequentially\n• Adjusted operating margin(1) increased 600 basis points to 25.9%\n• Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 29.6% to $1.05\n• Adjusted EPS(1) increased 25.0% to $1.15\n• Cash generated by operations decreased by $58.4 million to $166.4 million provided by\noperations\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. The same factors described in this release\nthat impacted these non-GAAP measures also impacted the comparable GAAP measures. Refer to pages 11 through 13 for\nfurther discussion and GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\n\"Our second quarter results reflect a higher quality of execution and performance, as we continue to\nimplement the new Robinson operating model. And although we continue to fight through an elongated\nfreight recession, we are winning and executing better at this point in the cycle,\" said C.H. Robinson's\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Bozeman. \"Our truckload business grew market share for the\nfourth consecutive quarter, and we took share the right way, with margin improvement in mind. And our\nadjusted income from operations increased 32 percent year-over-year for the full enterprise.\"\n1\n\"I also want to commend our people for continuing to embrace the changes that we’re making to deliver a\nhigher and more consistent level of performance and for the high quality second quarter results that they\ndelivered in what continues to be a challenging market,\" added Bozeman. \"With ongoing efforts to\nimprove the customer experience and our cost to serve, we continue to focus on ensuring that we’ll be\nready for the eventual freight market rebound, with a disciplined operating model that decouples\nheadcount growth from volume growth and drives operating leverage.\"\n\"All of the changes that we’re making are aimed at our North Star of generating incremental operating\nincome and delivering higher highs and higher lows over the course of freight market cycles. We will do\nthis by focusing on two main fronts…growing market share and expanding our operating income\nmargins,\" said Bozeman. \"We’ll continue to grow market share by leveraging our robust capabilities to\npower vertical-centric solutions, by reclaiming share in targeted segments, and by expanding our\naddressable market through value-added services and solutions that drive new volume to our four core\nmodes. We’ll also be more intentional with our go-to market strategy to drive additional synergies and\ncross-selling across our portfolio.\"\n\"We’ll expand our operating income margins by embedding Lean practices, removing waste and\nexpanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our\norganization structure in order to be the most efficient operator, in addition to the highest value provider.\nWe’ll optimize our gross profit by monitoring key input metrics and responding faster to error states and\nchanging market conditions with countermeasures and innovative technology that improves our execution.\nAs we take action on all of these fronts, I’m excited about the work that we’re doing to reinvigorate\nRobinson’s winning culture and to instill discipline with our new operating model. The operating model is\nhelping us execute a solid strategy even better, and we expect further improvement as we continue to\ncascade the new operating model deeper into the organization and as our team continues to embrace it and\nbuild operational muscle. I know from my past experiences of implementing Lean operating models, that\nimprovement isn’t always linear, and we still have a lot of grass to cut. I’m confident in the team’s\nwillingness and ability to drive a higher level of discipline in our operational execution,\" Bozeman\nconcluded.\n2\nSummary of Second Quarter of 2024 Results Compared to the Second Quarter of 2023\n• Total revenues increased 1.4% to $4.5 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing in our ocean\nservices, partially offset by lower pricing in our truckload services.\n• Gross profits increased 3.0% to $676.5 million. Adjusted gross profits increased 3.3% to\n$687.4 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload and less\nthan truckload (“LTL”) services.\n• Operating expenses decreased 4.4% to $509.3 million. Personnel expenses decreased 4.3% to\n$361.2 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts. Average employee headcount declined\n10.0%. Other selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased 4.8% to\n$148.1 million, with reductions across several expense categories.\n• Income from operations totaled $178.1 million, up 34.3% due to the increase in adjusted gross profits\nand decrease in operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin(1) of 25.9% increased 600 basis\npoints.\n• Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $21.5 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.9 million of interest expense, which decreased $0.3 million versus last year, due to a lower\naverage debt balance, and a $0.5 million net gain from foreign currency revaluation and realized\nforeign currency gains and losses.\n• The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.4%, compared to 14.9% in the second quarter last year.\nThe higher rate in the second quarter of this year was driven by lower benefits from foreign tax credits,\na higher foreign tax rate, and the impact of higher pretax income, partially offset by higher U.S. tax\ncredits and incentives.\n• Net income totaled $126.3 million, up 29.7% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $1.05 increased 29.6%.\nAdjusted EPS(1) of $1.15 increased 25.0%.\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nSecond quarter total revenues for the NAST segment totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of 2.9% over the prior\nyear, primarily driven by lower truckload pricing, reflecting an oversupply of truckload capacity compared\nto freight demand. NAST adjusted gross profits increased 4.8% in the quarter to $419.7 million. Adjusted\ngross profits in truckload increased 7.9% due to a 6.5% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment and\na 1.5% increase in truckload shipments. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our\ncustomers, which excludes fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 2.0% in the quarter compared to the\nprior year, while truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, also decreased approximately\n3.5%, resulting in an 8.0% increase in truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. LTL adjusted gross profits\nincreased 6.5% versus the year-ago period, driven by a 1.5% increase in LTL volume and a 5.0% increase\nin adjusted gross profit per order. NAST overall volume growth increased 1.5% for the quarter. Operating\nexpenses decreased 1.5%, primarily due to lower technology expenses and cost optimization efforts,\nwhich were partially offset by higher variable compensation.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nSecond quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 5.2% to $39.9 million due to an increase\nin integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. Managed Services adjusted gross\nprofits decreased 0.7%. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased 20.3% to\n$15.1 million, primarily due to a 23.3% decrease in Europe truckload adjusted gross profits.\nOther Income Statement Items\nInterest and other income/expense, net totaled $21.5 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.9 million of interest expense, which decreased $0.3 million versus the second quarter of 2023 due to a\nlower average debt balance, and a $0.5 million net gain from foreign currency revaluation and realized\nforeign currency gains and losses.\nThe second quarter effective tax rate was 19.4%, up from 14.9% last year. The higher rate in the second\nquarter of this year was driven by lower benefits from foreign tax credits, a higher foreign tax rate, and the\nimpact of higher pretax income, partially offset by higher U.S. tax credits and incentives. For 2024, we\nexpect our full-year effective tax rate to be 17% to 19%.\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were up 0.1%.\n7\nCash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution\nCash generated from operations totaled $166.4 million in the second quarter, compared to $224.8 million\nof cash generated from operations in the second quarter of 2023. The $58.4 million decrease in cash flow\nfrom operations was primarily related to a $166.7 million decline in cash provided by changes in net\noperating working capital, due to a $23.1 million sequential increase in net operating working capital in\nthe second quarter of 2024 compared to a $143.7 million sequential decrease in the second quarter of\n2023.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, cash returned to shareholders totaled $76.4 million, with $72.7 million in\ncash dividends and $3.7 million in repurchases of common stock.\nCapital expenditures totaled $19.3 million in the quarter.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding\namortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe\nadjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by\nthird parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of\nour results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profit. The reconciliation of gross profit to adjusted\ngross profit is presented below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nRevenues:\nTransportation $ 4,121,930 $ 4,084,827 0.9 % $ 8,204,518 $ 8,412,792 (2.5) %\nSourcing 361,418 337,029 7.2 % 691,141 620,734 11.3 %\nTotal revenues 4,483,348 4,421,856 1.4 % 8,895,659 9,033,526 (1.5) %\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related\nservices 3,470,383 3,453,560 0.5 % 6,925,379 7,124,591 (2.8) %\nPurchased products sourced for resale 325,556 302,800 7.5 % 625,142 557,799 12.1 %\nDirect internally developed software\namortization 10,883 8,749 24.4 % 21,105 16,066 31.4 %\nTotal direct expenses 3,806,822 3,765,109 1.1 % 7,571,626 7,698,456 (1.6) %\nGross profit $ 676,526 $ 656,747 3.0 % $ 1,324,033 $ 1,335,070 (0.8) %\nPlus: Direct internally developed software\namortization 10,883 8,749 24.4 % 21,105 16,066 31.4 %\nAdjusted gross profit $ 687,409 $ 665,496 3.3 % $ 1,345,138 $ 1,351,136 (0.4) %\nOur adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by adjusted gross\nprofit. Our adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring is a similar non-GAAP financial measure as adjusted operating\nmargin, but also excludes the impact of restructuring. We believe adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating margin -\nexcluding restructuring are useful measures of our profitability in comparison to our adjusted gross profit, which we consider a\nprimary performance metric as discussed above. The comparisons of operating margin to adjusted operating margin and\nadjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring are presented below:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 4,483,348 $ 4,421,856 1.4% $ 8,895,659 $ 9,033,526 (1.5%)\nIncome from operations 178,090 132,623 34.3% 305,223 293,656 3.9%\nOperating margin 4.0% 3.0% 100 bps 3.4% 3.3% 10 bps\nAdjusted gross profit $ 687,409 $ 665,496 3.3% $ 1,345,138 $ 1,351,136 (0.4%)\nIncome from operations 178,090 132,623 34.3% 305,223 293,656 3.9%\nAdjusted operating margin 25.9% 19.9% 600 bps 22.7% 21.7% 100 bps\nAdjusted gross profit $ 687,409 $ 665,496 3.3% $ 1,345,138 $ 1,351,136 (0.4%)\nAdjusted income from operations 193,279 146,755 31.7% 333,355 311,510 7.0%\nAdjusted operating margin - excluding 28.1% 22.1% 600 bps 24.8% 23.1% 170 bps\nrestructuring\n11\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nOur adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per\nshare (diluted) are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income per share\n(diluted) is calculated as income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and net income per\nshare (diluted) excluding the impact of restructuring. The adjustments to net income per share (diluted) include restructuring-\nrelated costs and a foreign currency loss on divested operations. We believe that these measures provide useful information to\ninvestors and include them within our internal reporting to our chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, the discussion of\nour results of operations includes discussion on the changes in our adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating\nmargin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per share (diluted). The reconciliation of income (loss) from\noperations to adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and net income per\nshare (diluted) to adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income per share (diluted) is presented below (in\nthousands except per share data):\nAll\nGlobal Other and\nNAST Forwarding Corporate Consolidated\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation:\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 141,102 $ 40,982 $ (3,994) $ 178,090\nSeverance and other personnel expenses 4,758 2,179 2,508 9,445\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses 3,776 1,331 637 5,744\nTotal adjustments to income (loss) from operations(1) 8,534 3,510 3,145 15,189\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations $ 149,636 $ 44,492 $ (849) $ 193,279\nAdjusted gross profit $ 419,657 $ 184,067 $ 83,685 $ 687,409\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations 149,636 44,492 (849) 193,279\nAdjusted operating margin -

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 2\nThoughts from President & CEO, Dave Bozeman\n■ Our Q2 results reflect a higher quality of execution and performance, as we continue\nto implement the new Robinson operating model. And although we continue to fight\nthrough an elongated freight recession, we are winning and executing better at this\npoint in the cycle.\n■ Our truckload business grew market share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we\ntook share the right way, with margin improvement in mind. And our adjusted income\nfrom operations increased 32% year-over-year for the full enterprise.\n■ We continue to focus on ensuring that we’ll be ready for the eventual freight market\nrebound, with a disciplined operating model that decouples headcount growth from\nvolume growth and drives operating leverage.\n■ All of the changes that we’re making are aimed at our North Star of generating\nincremental operating income and delivering higher highs and higher lows over the\ncourse of freight market cycles. We will do this by focusing on two main fronts…\ngrowing market share and expanding our operating income margins.\n3\nRobinson Operating Model\n1 2 3 4 5\nClear Defined Scorecard: Continuous Continuously\nLong-Term Strategic Measurable and and Rigorous Improving.\nStrategy Workstreams Actionable Measurement Never\nand Goals Inputs and Action Stops.\nPlans\n• Enterprise\n• Enterprise • Regular\n• Accountable\nStrategy Map • Divisional operating review\naction plans on all\ncadence (daily,\n• Divisional • Shared Services scorecards with\nweekly, monthly,\nStrategy Maps red\nquarterly)\n• Shared Services • Embrace and\n• Binary view of\nStrategy Maps attack the red!\nsuccess (green)\nor opportunity • e.g., Gemba walks\n(red) (go to the desk)\nPLAN ACTIVATE IMPROVE\n4\nQ2 Highlights\n■ Global freight markets continue to be impacted by low demand\nQ2 2024\nand excess capacity, resulting in suppressed transportation\nrates.\n■ Q2 NAST truckload & LTL volume increased 1.5% Y/Y, which\noutpaced the market indices for the fourth consecutive quarter, $4.5B $687M\nand truckload AGP/load improved Y/Y and sequentially, driving\nNAST adjusted income from operations up 26.6% Y/Y\nTotal Revenues Adj.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization\nof internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit\ndivided by total revenues. We believe adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures of our ability to source, add value, and sell services\nand products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement.

Robinson\n14701 Charlson Rd.\nEden Prairie, MN 55347\nwww.chrobinson.com\nFOR INQUIRIES, CONTACT:\nChuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Email: chuck.ives@chrobinson.com\nC.H. Robinson Reports 2024 First Quarter Results\nEden Prairie, MN, May 1, 2024 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (Nasdaq: CHRW)\ntoday reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nFirst Quarter Key Metrics:\n• Gross profits decreased 4.5% year-over-year to $647.5 million, but increased 6.3% sequentially\n• Income from operations decreased 21.1% year-over-year to $127.1 million, but increased 18.3%\nsequentially\n• Adjusted operating margin(1) decreased 420 basis points to 19.3%\n• Diluted earnings per share (EPS) decreased 18.8% to $0.78\n• Adjusted EPS(1) decreased 14.0% year-over-year to $0.86, but increased 72% sequentially\n• Cash from operations decreased by $287.9 million to $33.3 million used by operations\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. The same factors described in this release\nthat impacted these non-GAAP measures also impacted the comparable GAAP measures. Refer to pages 10 through 12 for\nfurther discussion and GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\n\"Our first quarter results and adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 reflects a change in our execution and\ndiscipline, as we began implementing a new Lean-based operating model. And although we continue to\nbattle through an elongated freight recession with an oversupply of capacity, I’m optimistic about our\nability to continue improving our execution regardless of the market environment,\" said C.H. Robinson's\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Bozeman. \"Our new operating model is being deployed at\nthe enterprise, divisional and shared service levels and is evolving our execution and accountability by\nbringing more structure to our continuous improvement cadence and culture. This new way of operating\nis starting to enable greater discipline, transparency, urgency and consistency in our decision making,\nbased on data and input metrics that can reliably lead to better outputs. It's also setting the tone of how we\n1\noperate and hold ourselves accountable, helping us make systemic improvements, build operational\nmuscle and drive value at speed. We began to see the benefits of our new operating model in our first\nquarter execution.\"\n\"As a result of disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts, we executed better across our\ncontractual and transactional portfolios in our NAST business, and in particular, in our truckload business\nin the first quarter. This resulted in improved optimization of volume and adjusted gross profit per\ntruckload, which improved sequentially despite an increase in our linehaul cost per mile for the full\nquarter versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, our first quarter truckload volume reflects\ngrowing market share, and we outpaced the market indices for the third quarter in a row,\" added Bozeman.\n\"In what continues to be a difficult environment, our resilient team of freight experts is responding to the\nchallenge and embracing the new operating model and the innovative tools that we continue to arm them\nwith. Our people have a powerful desire to win, and I thank them for their tireless efforts. They continue\nto be a differentiator for us and for our customers and carriers, and I’m confident in the team's willingness\nand ability to drive a higher level of discipline in our operational execution. We’re moving in the right\ndirection, and at the same time, everyone understands that we have more work to do,\" Bozeman\nconcluded.\n2\nSummary of First Quarter of 2024 Results Compared to the First Quarter of 2023\n• Total revenues decreased 4.3% to $4.4 billion, primarily driven by lower pricing in our truckload\nservices, partially offset by higher pricing and increased volume in our ocean services.\n• Gross profits decreased 4.5% to $647.5 million. Adjusted gross profits decreased 4.1% to\n$657.7 million, primarily driven by lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload.\n• Operating expenses increased 1.1% to $530.6 million. Personnel expenses decreased 1.0% to\n$379.1 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and partially offset by higher restructuring\ncharges related to workforce reductions. Average headcount declined 11.3%. Other selling, general\nand administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 7.1% to $151.5 million, primarily due to\nfavorable credit losses in the prior year and restructuring charges in the current year related to the\nimpairment of internally developed software.\n• Income from operations totaled $127.1 million, down 21.1% due to the decrease in adjusted gross\nprofits. Adjusted operating margin(1) of 19.3% declined 420 basis points.\n• Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $16.8 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.1 million of interest expense, which decreased $1.5 million versus last year, due to a lower\naverage debt balance, and a $3.9 million net gain from foreign currency revaluation and realized\nforeign currency gains and losses.\n• The effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.8%, compared to 13.5% in the first quarter last year. The\nhigher rate in the first quarter of this year was driven by lower tax benefits related to stock-based\ncompensation deliveries and higher foreign taxes, partially offset by higher U.S. tax credits and the\nimpact of lower pretax income.\n• Net income totaled $92.9 million, down 19.1% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $0.78 decreased\n18.8%. Adjusted EPS(1) of $0.86 decreased 14.0%.\n(1)\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. The same factors described in this release\nthat impacted these non-GAAP measures also impacted the comparable GAAP measures. Refer to pages 10 through 12 for\nfurther discussion and GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\n3\nNorth American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) Results\nSummarized financial results of our NAST segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 3,000,313 $ 3,304,187 (9.2) %\nAdjusted gross profits(1) 397,110 426,655 (6.9) %\nIncome from operations 108,895 134,022 (18.7) %\n____________________________________________\n(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nFirst quarter total revenues for the NAST segment totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of 9.2% over the prior\nyear, primarily driven by lower truckload pricing, reflecting an oversupply of truckload capacity compared\nto freight demand. NAST adjusted gross profits decreased 6.9% in the quarter to $397.1 million. Adjusted\ngross profits in truckload decreased 9.9% due to a 9.5% decrease in adjusted gross profit per shipment and\na 0.5% decline in truckload shipments. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our\ncustomers, which excludes fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 7.5% in the quarter compared to the\nprior year, while truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, also decreased approximately\n7.5%, resulting in an 8.5% decrease in truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. LTL adjusted gross profits\nincreased 1.7% versus the year-ago period, driven by a 3.0% increase in LTL volume, partially offset by a\n1.0% decrease in adjusted gross profit per order. NAST overall volume growth increased 1.5% for the\nquarter. Operating expenses decreased 1.5%, primarily due to lower technology expenses which were\npartially offset by a benefit in the prior year from lower credit losses. NAST average employee headcount\nwas down 12.6% in the quarter. Income from operations decreased 18.7% to $108.9 million, and adjusted\noperating margin declined 400 basis points to 27.4%.\n4\nGlobal Forwarding Results\nSummarized financial results of our Global Forwarding segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 858,637 $ 789,978 8.7 %\nAdjusted gross profits(1) 180,045 177,919 1.2 %\nIncome from operations 31,552 30,116 4.8 %\n____________________________________________\n(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nFirst quarter total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment increased 8.7% to $858.6 million,\nprimarily driven by higher pricing and increased volume in our ocean services. Adjusted gross profits\nincreased 1.2% in the quarter to $180.0 million. Ocean adjusted gross profits increased 2.5%, driven by a\n7.0% increase in shipments, partially offset by a 4.0% decrease in adjusted gross profit per shipment. Air\nadjusted gross profits decreased 2.4%, driven by a 20.5% decrease in adjusted gross profit per metric ton\nshipped, partially offset by a 23.0% increase in metric tons shipped. Customs adjusted gross profits\nincreased 11.8%, driven by an 8.5% increase in transaction volume and a 3.5% increase in adjusted gross\nprofit per transaction. Operating expenses increased 0.5%, primarily due to higher variable compensation.\nFirst quarter average employee headcount decreased 10.9%. Income from operations increased 4.8% to\n$31.6 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 17.5% in the quarter.\n5\nAll Other and Corporate Results\nTotal revenues and adjusted gross profits for Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Other Surface\nTransportation are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 553,361 $ 517,505 6.9 %\nAdjusted gross profits(1):\nRobinson Fresh $ 33,736 $ 31,145 8.3 %\nManaged Services 28,936 28,970 (0.1) %\nOther Surface Transportation 17,902 20,951 (14.6) %\n____________________________________________\n(1) Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained later in this release. The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\nFirst quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 8.3% to $33.7 million due to a 1.5% increase\nin case volume and integrated supply chain solutions for retail customers. Managed Services adjusted\ngross profits decreased 0.1%. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased 14.6% to\n$17.9 million, primarily due to a 16.9% decrease in Europe truckload adjusted gross profits.\nOther Income Statement Items\nThe first quarter effective tax rate was 15.8%, up from 13.5% last year. The higher rate in the first quarter\nof this year was driven by lower tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deliveries and higher\nforeign taxes, partially offset by higher U.S. tax credits and the impact of lower pretax income. For 2024,\nwe expect our full-year effective tax rate to be 17% to 19%.\nInterest and other income/expense, net totaled $16.8 million of expense, consisting primarily of\n$22.1 million of interest expense, which decreased $1.5 million versus the first quarter of 2023 due to a\nlower average debt balance, and a $3.9 million net gain from foreign currency revaluation and realized\nforeign currency gains and losses.\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 0.3% due to lower dilutive impact\nof equity awards.\n6\nCash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution\nCash used by operations totaled $33.3 million in the first quarter, compared to $254.5 million of cash\ngenerated from operations in the first quarter of 2023. The $287.9 million decrease in cash flow from\noperations was primarily related to a $369.5 million decline in cash provided by changes in net operating\nworking capital, due to a $134.6 million sequential increase in net operating working capital in the first\nquarter of 2024 compared to a $234.9 million sequential decrease in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, cash returned to shareholders totaled $90.7 million, with $74.6 million in cash\ndividends and $16.1 million in repurchases of common stock.\nCapital expenditures totaled $22.5 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be\n$85 million to $95 million.\n7\nAbout C.H. Robinson\nC.H.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not\nmaterial.\n9\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nOur adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding\namortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe\nadjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by\nthird parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of\nour results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profit. The reconciliation of gross profit to adjusted\ngross profit is presented below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 % change\nRevenues:\nTransportation $ 4,082,588 $ 4,327,965 (5.7) %\nSourcing 329,723 283,705 16.2 %\nTotal revenues 4,412,311 4,611,670 (4.3) %\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related services 3,454,996 3,671,031 (5.9) %\nPurchased products sourced for resale 299,586 254,999 17.5 %\nDirect internally developed software amortization 10,222 7,317 39.7 %\nTotal direct expenses 3,764,804 3,933,347 (4.3) %\nGross profit $ 647,507 $ 678,323 (4.5) %\nPlus: Direct internally developed software amortization 10,222 7,317 39.7 %\nAdjusted gross profit $ 657,729 $ 685,640 (4.1) %\nOur adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by adjusted gross\nprofit. Our adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring is a similar non-GAAP financial measure as adjusted operating\nmargin, but also excludes the impact of restructuring. We believe adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating margin -\nexcluding restructuring are useful measures of our profitability in comparison to our adjusted gross profit, which we consider a\nprimary performance metric as discussed above. The comparisons of operating margin to adjusted operating margin and\nadjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring are presented below:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 % change\nTotal revenues $ 4,412,311 $ 4,611,670 (4.3%)\nIncome from operations 127,133 161,033 (21.1%)\nOperating margin 2.9% 3.5% (60) bps\nAdjusted gross profit $ 657,729 $ 685,640 (4.1%)\nIncome from operations 127,133 161,033 (21.1%)\nAdjusted operating margin 19.3% 23.5% (420) bps\nAdjusted gross profit $ 657,729 $ 685,640 (4.1%)\nAdjusted income from operations 140,076 164,755 (15.0%)\nAdjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring 21.3% 24.0% (270) bps\n10\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nOur adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per\nshare (diluted) are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted net income per share\n(diluted) is calculated as income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and net income per\nshare (diluted) excluding the impact of restructuring. The adjustments to net income per share (diluted) include restructuring-\nrelated costs and a foreign currency loss on divested operations. We believe that these measures provide useful information to\ninvestors and include them within our internal reporting to our chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, the discussion of\nour results of operations includes discussion on the changes in our adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating\nmargin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per share (diluted).

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 2\nThoughts from President & CEO, Dave Bozeman\n■ In Q1, we began implementing a new operating model at the enterprise, divisional and shared service\nlevels, which is evolving our execution and accountability.\n■ New way of operating is starting to enable greater discipline, transparency, urgency and consistency in\nour decision making, based on data and input metrics than can reliably lead to better outputs. It's also\nsetting the tone of how we operate and hold ourselves accountable, helping us make systemic\nimprovements, build operational muscle and drive value at speed. We began to see the benefits of\nour new operating model in our Q1 execution.\n■ As a result of disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts, we executed better across our\ncontractual and transactional portfolios in our NAST business in Q1, and in particular, in our truckload\nbusiness. This resulted in improved optimization of volume and adjusted gross profit per truckload,\nwhich improved sequentially despite an increase in linehaul cost per mile for the full quarter versus\nQ4. Additionally, our truckload volume reflects growing market share, and we outpaced the market\nindices for the third quarter in a row.\n■ We’re moving in the right direction, and at the same time, everyone understands that we have more\nwork to do.\n3\nQ1 Highlights\n■ Global freight markets continue to be impacted by excess\nQ1 2024\ncapacity, resulting in a loose market and suppressed\ntransportation rates.\n■ Q1 truckload volume declined 0.5% Y/Y, which outpaced the\nmarket indices, and truckload AGP/load improved as we moved $4.4B $658M\nthrough the quarter.\n■ Red Sea disruption has driven ocean rates higher, but rates have Total Revenues Adj. Gross Profits(1)\ncome down from the February peak as capacity has been\n-4.3% Y/Y -4.1% Y/Y\nrepositioned and new vessel capacity enters the market.\n■ Focused on deploying our new operating model, providing best-\n$127M $0.78\nin-class service to our customers and carriers, gaining profitable\nshare in targeted market segments, optimizing our structure\ncosts, streamlining our processes by continuing to remove waste\nIncome from Ops.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization\nof internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit\ndivided by total revenues. We believe adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures of our ability to source, add value, and sell services\nand products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement. The reconciliation of gross profit to\nadjusted gross profit and gross profit margin to adjusted gross profit margin are presented below:\nThree Months Ended March 31\n$ in thousands 2024 2023\nRevenues:\nTransportation $ 4,082,588 $ 4,327,965\nSourcing 329,723 283,705\nTotal Revenues $ 4,412,311 $ 4,611,670\nCosts and expenses:\nPurchased transportation and related services 3,454,996 3,671,031\nPurchased produced sourced for resale 299,586 254,999\nDirect internally developed software amortization 10,222 7,317\nTotal direct costs $ 3,764,804 $ 3,933,347\nGross profit & Gross profit margin $ 647,507 14.7% $ 678,323 14.7%\nPlus: Direct internally developed software amortization 10,222 7,317\nAdjusted gross profit/Adjusted gross profit margin $ 657,729 14.9% $ 685,640 14.9%\n20\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nOur adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by adjusted gross profit. Our adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring is a\nsimilar non-GAAP financial measure to adjusted operating margin, but also excludes the impact of restructuring. We believe adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating margin -\nexcluding restructuring are useful measures of our profitability in comparison to our adjusted gross profit, which we consider a primary performance metric as discussed above. The\ncomparisons of operating margin to adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring are presented below:\nThree Months Ended March 31\n$ in thousands 2024 2023\nTotal Revenues $ 4,412,311 $ 4,611,670\nIncome from operations 127,133 161,033\nOperating margin 2.9% 3.5%\nAdjusted gross profit $ 657,729 $ 685,640\nIncome from operations 127,133 161,033\nAdjusted operating margin 19.3% 23.5%\nAdjusted gross profit $ 657,729 $ 685,640\nAdjusted income from operations(1) 140,076 164,755\nAdjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring 21.3% 24.0%\n1. In the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024, we incurred restructuring expenses of $7.9 million related to workforce reductions and $5.0 million of other charges, primarily related to an impairment of\ninternally developed software due to reprioritizing the efforts of our product and technology teams on fewer initiatives to accelerate the capabilities of our platform. In the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2023, we incurred restructuring expenses of $3.6 million related to workforce reductions and $0.1 million of other charges.\n21\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nOur adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per share (diluted) are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted income (loss)\nfrom operations and adjusted net income per share (diluted) is calculated as income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and net income per share (diluted)\nexcluding the impact of restructuring. The adjustments to net income per share (diluted) include restructuring-related costs and a foreign currency loss on divested operations. We believe that these\nmeasures provide useful information to investors and include them within our internal reporting to our chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations includes\ndiscussion on the changes in our adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted operating margin - excluding restructuring, and adjusted net income per share (diluted).

Robinson Has Achieved Automation Across the Entire Lifecycle of a Freight Shipment\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n**With over 10,000 email transactions per day no longer done manually,** **new proprietary tech serves customers in seconds instead of hours**\n\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  By creating technology that reads incoming email then replicates tasks a person would do, global logistics company C.H. Robinson has automated steps across the entire lifecycle of a freight shipment: from giving customers a price quote, to accepting a load, to setting appointments for pickup and delivery, to checking on the load in transit. \n\nThis new proprietary tech incorporates generative artificial intelligence to overcome the decades-old challenge of automating transactions that shippers still commonly choose to do by email. Shippers directly integrated with C.H. Robinson’s platform have for years been able to get automated service instantly. But the same request sent by email had to wait for a person. Now, more than 10,000 of those routine transactions per day have been automated. Shippers who use email can get the same speed-to-market and cost savings as other customers, and the C.H. Robinson teams that serve them can spend more time on more valuable work. \n\n“We announced in May that we’d been using our new tech for emailed price requests. Within a few short months, we created new models to automate more shipping steps and have already implemented them at scale,” said Arun Rajan, the company’s Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. “This a major efficiency breakthrough for the industry and for supply chains around the world. When you think about retailers that need hundreds of different products on their shelves or automakers that rely on just-in-time delivery for the 30,000 different parts in a car, saving hours and minutes on every shipment matters.” \n\nAfter starting with price quotes, C.H. Robinson has applied generative AI to increasingly complex tasks. That required infusing the technology with the company’s market knowledge, specialized expertise in nearly every kind of supply chain and the specifics of each customer’s unique needs. \n\n“An emailed load tender might only say, ‘I have a load for Tuesday’ because the shipper knows we know what they ship on Tuesdays. Or it could contain thousands of words about 20 loads in a PDF attachment with handwritten notes on it,” said Mark Albrecht, the company’s Vice President for Artificial Intelligence. “Our tech can connect details in different parts of the email, discern what’s missing, go fill in the blanks and take action. We’ve even built it to determine things like which shipments are best for less-than-truckload and how different commodities should be palletized. We can do that like no one else, because we have the competitive advantage of the largest dataset in the industry and because our generative AI tools continually learn from our experts.” \n\nBefore C.H. Robinson’s newest technology, it took as much as four hours for an emailed load tender to be taken care of by a person. That’s been reduced to 90 seconds. \n\n“Once a person got to the email in their inbox, it still took an average of seven minutes to manually enter all the shipment details into our system – and that’s for a single load,” Albrecht said. “If the email tendered us 20 loads, a person would be stuck manually entering the information one load at a time. With generative AI, we can process all 20 loads simultaneously in the same 90 seconds. That’s an enormous time savings, especially when you consider we’ve scaled this to thousands of shipment orders per day just since June.” \n\nC.H. Robinson’s new automation tech is being used for \n\n  * **Emailed price requests** : This has grown to 2,600 quotes delivered a day, and at 32 seconds is now even faster. Having started with truckload quotes, the tech has also been expanded to handle LTL quotes. \n  * **Emailed load tenders:** The tech is turning emails into 5,500 shipment orders a day, achieved in 90 seconds. \n  * **Emailed appointments** : When a customer uses email rather than C.H. Robinson’s [touchless appointments](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chrobinson.com%2Fen-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2F2024%2Ftouchless-appointments-for-freight-industry%2F&esheet=54144987&newsitemid=20241031448369&lan=en-US&anchor=touchless+appointments&index=1&md5=a48ae3be964ba7598efbcec52dd8f4f8), the tech extracts the details needed to lock in a pick-up or delivery time. So far, this is done 3,000 times a day across more than 26,000 locations within 60 seconds. \n\n\n  * **In-transit visibility** : For instances when a carrier’s automated status updates aren’t working, C.H. Robinson is piloting the use of generative AI to interact with the carrier, rather than taking up staff time to send an email, text or instant message. \n\n\n\n“While other companies may be using generative AI for simple data queries or chatbots, we’re harnessing that power to create tangible business value for our customers,” Rajan said. “The faster we can accomplish every routine step in getting their freight on a truck, the [greater their potential cost savings](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chrobinson.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Fblog%2Fwhy-you-should-put-spot-freight-in-your-route-guide%2F&esheet=54144987&newsitemid=20241031448369&lan=en-US&anchor=greater+their+potential+cost+savings&index=2&md5=9d05944d61687908bbff84cd943f8fa9). The more we free our staff from mundane tasks, the more they can enhance and strengthen our customers’ supply chains. In a world where a port strike, a hurricane and a Middle East war can be happening all at once, we’re focused on helping our customers be resilient in the face of these increasingly frequent and intense disruptions.” \n\n**ABOUT C.H.
