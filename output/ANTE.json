(\"AirNet\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: ANTE), today announced that it received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq (the \"Staff\") on November 12, 2024, notifying the Company that it has regained compliance with the minimum market value of publicly held shares (\"MVPHS\") requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(5).\n\nThe Company was previously notified by the Staff on September 18, 2024 that it was not in compliance with the MVPHS requirement due to its failure to maintain a minimum MVPHS of US$1.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Since then, the Staff has determined that the Company's MVPHS had been US$1.0 million or greater from October 28 through November 11, 2024. Therefore, the Staff determined that the requirement was met on November 12, 2024.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual reports to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties.

(\"AirNet\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: ANTE), today announced that it received two deficiency letters (the \"Deficiency Letters\") from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (\"Nasdaq\") both dated on September 18, 2024 indicating that (1) the Company is no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules as the Company's closing bid price per American depositary share (\"ADS\"), each representing one ordinary share of the Company, has been below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days, and (2) the Company is no longer in compliance with Rule 5550(a)(5) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (\"MVPHS\") of US$1.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days.\n\nThe Deficiency Letters have no immediate impact on the Company's listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Pursuant to Rules 5810(c)(3)(A) and 5810(c)(3)(D) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, respectively, the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 17, 2025 (the \"Compliance Period\"), to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price and minimum MVPHS requirements. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the closing bid price per ADS is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter will be closed. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the Company's MVPHS is at least US$1.0 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance with the minimum MVPHS requirement, and the matter will be closed.\n\nIf the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by March 17, 2025, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company must meet the continued listing requirements for MVPHS and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of bid price requirement, of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and provides written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, Nasdaq will grant an additional 180 calendar days to the Company (the \"Second Compliance Period\"). However, if Nasdaq concludes that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company's securities will be subject to delisting. If the Company chooses to implement a reverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than ten business days prior to March 17, 2025, or the expiration of the Second Compliance Period if granted.\n\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum MVPHS requirement by March 17, 2025, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, the Company may appeal Nasdaq's determination to delist its securities, but there can be no assurance Nasdaq would grant the Company's request for continued listing.\n\nThis announcement is made in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a notification of deficiency.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
