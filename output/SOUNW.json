In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,” “will,” “would” and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our expected financial performance, our ability to implement our business strategy and anticipated business and operations, and guidance for financial results for 2024 and 2025. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our management, are inherently uncertain. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties impacting SoundHound’s business including, our ability to successfully launch and commercialize new products and services and derive significant revenue, our market opportunity and our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers, unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from our 2024 acquisitions, the ability of our 2024 acquisitions to be accretive on the company's financial results, and those other factors described in our risk factors set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We do not intend to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance**\n\nTo supplement the company’s financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP earnings per share. \n\nThe company believes that providing this non-GAAP information in addition to the GAAP financial information allows investors to view the financial results in the way the company views its operating results. The company also believes that providing this information allows investors to not only better understand the company's financial performance, but also, better evaluate the information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. \n\nAs such, the company believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides the reader with useful supplemental information that allows for greater transparency in the review of the company’s financial and operational performance. \n\nThe company defines its non-GAAP measures by excluding certain items: \n\nThe company arrives at non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin by excluding (i) amortization of intangibles (including acquired intangible assets) and (ii) stock-based compensation. \n\nThe company arrives at adjusted EBITDA by excluding (i) total interest and other income/(expense), net, (ii) income taxes (benefits), (iii) depreciation and amortization expense (including acquired intangible assets), (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition, and (vi) acquisition-related costs. \n\nThe company arrives at non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share by excluding (i) depreciation and amortization expense (including acquired intangible assets), (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition, (iv) acquisition-related costs, and (v) income tax effects related to acquisitions. \n\nReconciliations of GAAP to these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are included in the tables below. When analyzing the company's operating results, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutes for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nTo the extent that the company presents any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, the company does not present a quantitative reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (or otherwise present such forward-looking GAAP measures) because it is impractical to do so. \n\n**Third Quarter Reconciliation of GAAP Gross Profit to Non-GAAP Gross Profit and GAAP Gross Margin to Non-GAAP Gross Margin**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**GAAP gross profit** 1 |  **$** |  **12,193** |  **$** |  **9,678**  \nAdjustments:   \nAmortization of Intangibles  |  2,691  |  -   \nStock-based compensation  |  99  |  98   \n**Non-GAAP gross profit** |  **$** |  **14,983** |  **$** |  **9,776**  \n**GAAP gross margin** |  **48.6%** |  **72.9%**  \n**Non-GAAP gross margin** |  **59.7%** |  **73.7%**  \n  \n(1) |  GAAP gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from revenues.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Third Quarter Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**GAAP net loss** |  **$** |  **(21,751)** |  **$** |  **(20,197)**  \nAdjustments:   \nTotal other expense, net**1** |  (1,525)  |  4,106   \nIncome taxes/(benefits)  |  (10,491)  |  1,561   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  5,365  |  530   \nStock-based compensation  |  9,060  |  6,692   \nChange in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities  |  (1,356)  |  -   \nAcquisition-related expenses  |  4,829  |  -   \n**Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **(15,869)** |  **$** |  **(7,308)**  \n  \n(1) |  Includes other income (expense), net of $2.6 and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Third Quarter Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share**\n\n**Three Months Ended** (thousands)   \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**GAAP net loss attributable to SoundHound common shareholders** |  **$** |  **(21,751)** |  **$** |  **(20,844)**  \nAdjustments:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  5,365  |  530   \nStock-based compensation  |  9,060  |  6,692   \nChange in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities  |  (1,356)  |  -   \nAcquisition-related expenses  |  4,829  |  -   \nIncome tax effects related to acquisitions  |  (11,105)  |  -   \n**Non-GAAP net loss** |  **$** |  **(14,958)** |  **$** |  **(13,622)**  \n**GAAP net loss per share 1** |  **(0.06)** |  **(0.09)**  \nAdjustments  |  0.02  |  0.03   \n**Non-GAAP net loss per share 1** |  **(0.04)** |  **(0.06)**  \n  \n(1) |  Weighted average common shares outstanding (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 360,385,812 and 242,022,268, respectively.   \n---|---  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241112739401r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112739401/en/>\n\n**Investors:** Scott Smith 408-724-1498 IR@SoundHound.com\n\n**Media:** Fiona McEvoy 415-610-6590 PR@SoundHound.com\n\nSource: SoundHound AI, Inc.\n\n## Investor Tools\n\n[ Print Page](#)\n\n[ Email Alerts](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n[ Contact IR](/ir-resources/contact-ir)\n\nWe use cookies to operate our services.
