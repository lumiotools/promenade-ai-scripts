Forward-looking statements are\nstatements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to matters such as future financial performance including the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025\noutlook; future operational performance; the anticipated impact of specific items on future earnings; the Company's expectationsregarding near term growth trends; and the Company's plans,\nobjectives and expectations.

Potential factors that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to comply with, or pursue business strategies due to\nthe covenants under the agreements governing its indebtedness; the Company's ability to remediate material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, discovery of additional\nweaknesses, and its inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; the Company's ability to forecast and achieve\nanticipated net sales and earnings estimates in light of periodic economic uncertainty; the inherent risks, costs and uncertainties associated with integrating Sierra Wireless, Inc. successfully and\nrisks of not achieving all or any of the anticipated benefits, or the risk that the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or take longer to realize than expected; the uncertainty surrounding\nthe impact and duration of supply chain constraints and any associated disruptions; export restrictions and laws affecting the Company's trade and investments, and tariffs or the occurrence of\ntrade wars; worldwide economic and political disruptions, including as a result of inflation and current geopolitical conflicts;tightening credit conditions related to the United States banking\nsystem concerns; competitive changes in the marketplace including, but not limited to, the pace of growth or adoption rates of applicable products or technologies; downturns in the business\ncycle; decreasing average selling prices of the Company's products; the Company's reliance on a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors for components and materials; changes in\nprojected or anticipated end-user markets; future responses to and effects of public health crises; and the Company's ability toforecast its annual non-GAAP normalized tax rate due to material\nchanges that could occur during the fiscal year, which could include, but are not limited to, significant changes resulting fromtax legislation, acquisitions, entity structures or operational changes\nand other significant events. Additionally, forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in the risk factors disclosed in the\nCompany's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC\non March 28, 2024 as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by subsequent reports theCompany files with the SEC. In light of the significant risks\nand uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein that may cause actual performance and results to differ materially from those predicted, any such forward-looking\ninformation should not be regarded as representations or guarantees by the Company of future performance or results, or that itsobjectives or plans will be achieved or that any of its operating\nexpectations or financial forecasts will be realized. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any\nforward-looking information contained herein, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof. Except as requiredby law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly release\nthe results of any update or revision to any forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of\nunanticipated or future events, or otherwise.\n2| QUARTERLY EARNINGS PRESENTATION | Q3’25\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, this release includes a presentation of select non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-\nGAAP measures of gross margin, product development and engineering expense, SG&A expense, operating expenses, net, operating income or loss, operating margin, interest expense, net, net (loss)\nincome attributable to common stockholders, diluted (loss) earnings per share, normalized tax rate, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the following items, if any and as applicable,\nas set forth in the reconciliations in the tables below under \"Supplemental Information: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.”\n• Share-based compensation\n• Intangible amortization\n• Transaction and integration related costs or recoveries (including costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Sierra Wireless, Inc.)\n• Restructuring and other reserves, including cumulative other reserves associated with historical activity including environmental, pension, deferred compensation and right-of-use asset\nimpairments\n• Litigation costs or dispute settlement charges or recoveries\n• Equity method income or loss\n• Investment gains, losses, reserves and impairments, including interest income from debt investments\n• Write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs\n• Loss on extinguishment of debt\n• Debt commitment fee\n• Goodwill and intangible impairment\n• Amortization of inventory step-up\n3 | QUARTERLY EARNINGS PRESENTATION | Q3’25\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn the financial results provided in thispresentation, the Company also presents adjustedEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income\nattributable to common stockholders plus interest expense, interest income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortizationand share-based compensation, and adjusted to\nexclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core results over time. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net\nsales. The Company considers free cash flow, which may be positive or negative, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital\nexpenditures. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of\noperations. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the items identified above because such items are either operating expenses that would not otherwise have been\nincurred by the Company in the normal course of the Company's business operations or are notreflective of the Company's core results over time. These excluded items may include recurring as\nwell as non-recurring items, and no inference should be made that all of these adjustments, charges, costs or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For example: certain\nrestructuring and integration-related expenses (which consist of employee termination costs, facility closure or lease termination costs, and contract termination costs) may be considered\nrecurring given the Company's ongoing efforts to be more cost effective and efficient; certain acquisition and disposition-related adjustments or expenses may be deemed recurring given the\nCompany's regular evaluation of potential transactions and investments; and certain litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains (which may includeestimated losses for which the\nCompany may have established a reserve, as well as any actual settlements, judgments, or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, disputes or\nsimilar matters, and insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters) may be viewed as recurring given that the Company may from time to time be involved in, and\nmayresolve, litigation, arbitration, disputes, and similar matters.\nNotwithstanding that certain adjustments, charges, costs or expenses may be considered recurring, in order to provide meaningful comparisons, the Company believes that it is appropriate to\nexclude suchitems because they are not reflective of the Company's core results and tend to vary based on timing, frequency and magnitude.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's comparable financial performance between periods. In addition, the Company's\nmanagement generally excludes the items noted above when managing and evaluating the performance of the business. See \"Supplemental Information: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP\nResults\" for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures for the second and third quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the third quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024.\nThe Company adopted a full-year, normalized tax rate for the computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision in order to provide better comparability across the interim reporting periods by\nreducing thequarterly variability in non-GAAP tax rates that can occur throughout the year. In estimating the full-year non-GAAP normalized tax rate, the Company utilized a full-year financial\nprojection that considersmultiple factors such as changes to the Company's current operating structure, existing positions in various tax jurisdictions, the effect of key tax law changes, and other\nsignificant tax matters to the extentthey are applicable to the full fiscal year financial projection. In addition to the adjustments described above, this normalized tax rate excludes the impact of\nshare-based awards and the amortization ofacquisition-related intangible assets. For fiscal year 2024, the Company's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate was 12% and was applied to each\nquarter of fiscal year 2024. For fiscal year 2025 ending January 26, 2025 (\"fiscal year 2025\"), theCompany's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate is 15% and will be applied to each quarter of\nfiscal year 2025. The Company's non-GAAP normalized tax rate on non-GAAP net income may be adjustedduring the year to account for events or trends that the Company believes materially\nimpact the original annual non-GAAP normalized tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting fromtax legislation, acquisitions, entity structures or operational changes and\nother significant events. These additional non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for any measuresderived in accordance with GAAP and may be inconsistent with\nsimilar measures presented by other companies.\nTo provide additional insight into the Company’s fourth quarter outlook, this presentation also presents certain of the forementioned non-GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis. The\nCompany is unable to include a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP results to the corresponding GAAP measures as this is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high\nvariability and low visibility with respect to the impact of transaction, integration and restructuring expenses, share-based awards, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other\nitems that are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. The Company expects the variability of the above charges to have a potentially significant impact on its GAAP financial results.\n4 | QUARTERLY EARNINGS PRESENTATION | Q3’25\nNear-Term Priorities\n1 2 3\nFocus our strategy, Accelerate revenue growth Energize our people and\nrationalize our portfolio and and drive margin expansion elevate our winning culture\nimprove the balance sheet through disciplined\ninvestment, innovation and\nefficiency\nUpdates\nCEO Message\n1 2 3\n• Completed strategic • Swift changes to intensify • Launched Semtech RISING,\nportfolio evaluation, with customer engagement to elevating our determination\ngranular assessment provide technical and and drive to win\ncorrelating investment operational solutions • Leveraged expertise of\nlevels and priorities to • Instituted disciplined Semtech’s board members\nmulti-year growth curves investment plan, leveraging to elevate human capital\n• Increasing investment in our design competencies development\ndata center products, • Achieved multi-\nprojected to be a long-term generational roadmap\nand transformational alignment with customers\ngrowth engine • Our customers and target\nmarkets are moving\ntoward us\n55 || Q QUUAARRTTEERRLLYY E EAARRNNININGGSS P PRREESSEENNTTAATTIOIONN | | Q Q33’2’255\nQ3’25\nRESULTS\n66 || Q QUUAARRTTEERRLLYY E EAARRNNININGGSS P PRREESSEENNTTAATTIOIONN | | Q Q33’2’255\n\"We are very pleased to report broad-based growth across each of our end markets, and\nparticularly in data center, where we project AI-driven product demand to be a long-term and\ntransformational growth engine for Semtech.
