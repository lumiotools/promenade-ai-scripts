Total revenue reached US$101.1 million, a historical high and representing a sequential increase of 15.6% and a year-over-year growth of 44.1%. Bottom line also largely increased in GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech reached US$17.8 million, representing a quarter-over-quarter growth of 584.6% and a year-over-year growth of 34.0%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech amounted to US$20.1 million, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 286.5% and a year-over-year increase of 25.6%.\n\nIn the third quarter, we added 50,500 customers with deposits, more than doubled from a year ago and the total number of customers with deposits at the end of the third quarter reached approximately 1,032,800. We took advantage of the active market condition in October and by now we have already achieved our annual guidance of acquiring 150,000 newly customers with deposits. Driven by strong net asset inflow from retail clients and mark to market gains, total account balance further increased 6.7% quarter-over-quarter and 115.9% year-over-year to US$40.8 billion, setting another historic high.\n\nWe continued to add new products on our platform to enhance user experience, which we believe is key to our long-term success. In the third quarter, we officially launched Hong Kong stock option trading and short selling. In early November, we have upgraded the Hong Kong stock option feature by offering weekly option in addition to monthly option. Additionally, in September, we introduced the Tiger Boss debit card, along with the T+0 automatic subscription and redemption feature for our wealth management product, Tiger Vault. This integration allows users to manage their investment portfolios more conveniently, seamlessly bridging daily spending, wealth management, and stock investments.\n\nOur corporate businesses continued to perform well in the third quarter of 2024. During this period, we underwrote a total of 13 U.S. and Hong Kong IPOs, including “NIP Group” and “Voicecomm Technology” and we served as the exclusive lead bank for the U.S. IPOs of “NIP Group” and “XCHG Limited”. In our ESOP business, we added 18 new clients in the third quarter, bringing the total number of ESOP clients served to 597 as of September 30, 2024.”\n\n**Financial Highlights for Third Quarter 2024**\n\n  * **Total revenues** increased 44.1% year-over-year to US$101.1 million.\n  * **Total net revenues** increased 47.1% year-over-year to US$85.4 million.\n  * **Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech** was US$17.8 million compared to a net income of US$13.2 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 34.0%.\n  * **Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech** was US$20.1 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of US$16.0 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 25.6%.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). We define non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech as net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech excluding share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net loss or income per ADS - diluted is non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech divided by the weighted average number of diluted ADSs.\n\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors' assessment of our operating performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations. Share-based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to total operating costs and expenses, net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review these historical non-GAAP financial measures in light of the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing our data comparatively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**About UP Fintech Holding Limited**\n\nUP Fintech Holding Limited is a leading online brokerage firm focusing on global investors.
