Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our leadership in providing safe, pilotless, and sustainable eVTOL solutions in the Urban Air Mobility sector, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to ensure sustainable growth and profitability.”\n\nThe Company's proposed repurchases may be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on the market conditions and in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program will be determined by the Company’s management at its discretion based on ongoing assessments of price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with the Company’s working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. The Company expects to fund repurchases made under this program from its existing cash balance and cash generated from operations.\n\n**About EHang**\n\nEHang (Nasdaq: EH) is the world’s leading urban air mobility (“UAM”) technology platform company.
