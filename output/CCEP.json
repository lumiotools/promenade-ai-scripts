We are pleased to have delivered another solid performance, thanks to our great brands, great people and great execution.\n\nWe continue to create value for our customers, delivering revenue growth and value share gains both in-store and online. Our Australia, Pacific and Southeast Asia business unit saw strong volume growth – adjusted comparable volume grew 7.5% vs 2023 in the region. Volume declined in Europe (-2.8%) reflecting great in-market execution offset by adverse weather, strategic de-listings and a strong H1 last year.\n\nThanks to strong consumer demand and great execution across all key markets, our great brands went from strength to strength. Coca-Cola Classic grew 3.0%, and Sprite grew 5.9%. Exciting innovation helped grow our categories, including the sports category that grew 4.8%, and saw the launch of Powerade Golden Mango in some markets.\n\nSee some more highlights below or read the full update, including footnotes, [here](https://ir.cocacolaep.com/static-files/3bd0c199-cea7-4685-9d83-ee07d0ab85bf).\n\n[Read our full H1 2024 Financial Results here ](https://ir.cocacolaep.com/static-files/3bd0c199-cea7-4685-9d83-ee07d0ab85bf)\n\n  * Sprite \n  * Philippines acquisition \n  * Investing in sustainability \n\n\n\nSprite\n\n![Untitled design 58](/assets/Uploads/blocks/two-column-content/Untitled-design-58__ScaleWidthWzEwMF0.png)\n\n## Sprite is still a firm favourite, with volume up in H1.\n\nvs H1 2023\n\nPhilippines acquisition\n\n![DSC03871 1 1](/assets/Uploads/blocks/two-column-content/DSC03871-1-1__ScaleWidthWzEwMF0.JPG)\n\n## In February, the Philippines joined the CCEP family, taking our total employees to over 42,000.\n\nInvesting in sustainability \n\n![2 v12](/assets/Uploads/blocks/two-column-content/2-v12__ScaleWidthWzEwMF0.png)\n\n## We invested €40m in a new production line for refillable glass bottles at our Lüneburg factory in Germany.\n\n**Adjusted Comparable**  \n---  \n**Revenue** | **Operating profit** | **Earnings per share**  \n**H1 2024** | €10.1 billion | €1.3 billion | €1.97  \n**Change vs H1 2023** | 3.5% (FXN) | 9.0% | 7,0%  \n  \nFor footnotes and forward looking statements, please see our full financial results [here](https://ir.cocacolaep.com/static-files/3bd0c199-cea7-4685-9d83-ee07d0ab85bf).\n\n> We are pleased to have delivered a solid first half performance reflecting great brands and great execution. I would like to thank our great people, alongside our customers and brand partners. We delivered solid top and bottom-line growth, and impressive free cash flow. The great performance of APS, led by the Philippines, offset softer volumes in Europe driven by adverse weather. This demonstrates how our geographic diversification makes us a stronger and more robust business. We continue to grow share ahead of the market and to create value for our customers. Our focus on revenue growth management, headline price and promotion strategy across a broad pack offering also drove solid gains in revenue per unit case. Looking ahead, we are well placed operating in categories that remain resilient. We continue to invest for growth and have strong commercial plans in place for the rest of this year and beyond to engage customers and consumers. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth, actively managing our pricing and promotional spend to remain affordable and relevant to our consumers, alongside our focus on productivity and free cash flow. In that context, we reaffirm our full year guidance for 2024. We are confident that we have the right strategy, done sustainably, to deliver on our mid-term growth objectives. Combined with our first half interim dividend, this demonstrates the strength of our business, and our ability to deliver continued shareholder value.\n\n#### Damian Gammell\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n[Read our H1 2024 trading update here ](https://ir.cocacolaep.com/static-files/3bd0c199-cea7-4685-9d83-ee07d0ab85bf)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[ ![H1 Financial Results website List Image](/assets/Uploads/resources/H1-Financial-Results-website-List-Image__ScaleWidthWzEwMF0.png) 07 August 2024 CCEP H1 2024 Financial Results Read more ](/media/news/2024/ccep-h1-2024-financial-results/)\n\n[ ![SD DG Article Mobile 1](/assets/2024-VI-Update-Assets/DG-SD-Article/SD-DG-Article-Mobile-1__ScaleWidthWzM0MF0.png) 23 February 2024 Discussing the acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. and the future of CCEP Read more ](/media/news/2024/discussing-acquisition-of-ccbpi-and-future-of-ccep/)\n\n[ ![CCBPI List Image](/assets/Financial-Results/FY23/CCBPI-Completion/CCBPI-List-Image__ScaleWidthWzM0MF0.png) 23 February 2024 CCEP, together with Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

Our focus on revenue and margin growth management, along with our price and promotion strategy, drove solid gains in revenue per unit case. Transactions outpaced volume and we grew both share and household penetration across our markets. Given our strong year to date performance, we are reaffirming our full year guidance and declaring a full year dividend up almost 10% on last year. This demonstrates the strength of our business and ability to continue to deliver shareholder value. “In the third quarter, we also delivered top line growth despite mixed summer weather across Europe and the ongoing execution of our long-term transformation strategy in Indonesia. We delivered fantastic activation, including during the Women's World Cup, supporting strong underlying volume growth in Australia and New Zealand. “Looking to next year and beyond, we remain confident in the resilience of our categories, despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. We continue to actively manage our pricing and promotional spend to remain affordable and relevant to our consumers, alongside our focus on productivity and free cash flow. All supported by our talented and engaged colleagues, and our strong relationships with our brand partners and customers. Finally, we have been working closely with The Coca-Cola Company and Aboitiz on the proposed acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, aligned with our aim of driving sustainable and stronger growth through diversification and scale. We remain on track to close early next year and look forward to sharing more in due course.”\n\n#### Damian Gammell\n\nCEO, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners\n\nTo read our full results, click [here.](https://ir.cocacolaep.com/static-files/152e51dc-0bab-43a1-a2fd-182d910968a5)\n\n  * [Home](/)\n  * [Media](/media/)\n  * [News](/media/news/)\n  * [2023](/media/news/2023/)\n  * Coca-Cola Europacific Partners…\n\n\n\nBack to top\n"

Our performance reflects great in-market execution with further growth in the home channel and the tail end of continued recovery of the away from home channel. This resulted in strong volume growth across our developed markets and albeit early in its transformation journey, Indonesia delivered volume growth in the core sparkling category. Our focus on revenue growth management and our headline price and promotion strategy also drove solid gains in revenue per unit case. Although our first quarter has set us up really well for the rest of the year, it is typically our smallest. We are building on this momentum supported by fantastic activation plans. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth and solid free cash flow, and I am pleased to confidently reaffirm our full-year guidance for 2023, despite a dynamic outlook. We are confident that we have the right strategy, done sustainably, to deliver on our ambitious mid-term growth objectives which combined with today’s interim dividend declaration, demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business, and our ability to deliver continued shareholder value.
