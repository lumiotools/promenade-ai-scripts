(NASDAQ: LPCN), a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to augment therapeutics through effective oral delivery, today announced the publication and discussion of a manuscript _\"Oral LPCN 1148 Improves Sarcopenia and Hepatic Encephalopathy in Male Patients with Cirrhosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial\"_ in the journal Hepatology and discussion at The Liver Meeting (AASLD) 2024 Editor's Cut: Clinical Study Session held on November 16, 2024. LPCN 1148 is targeted to be a \"First in Class\" product candidate with a novel mechanism of action for overt hepatic encephalopathy and sarcopenia indications. A copy of the publication can be accessed [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304805-1&h=1195872298&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fhep%2Fabstract%2F9900%2Foral_lpcn_1148_improves_sarcopenia_and_hepatic.1074.aspx&a=here).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Lipocine Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/627654/Lipocine_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/627654/Lipocine_Logo.html)\n\nThe publication features the results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial (LPCN 1148-21-001) that evaluated LPCN 1148 in men with cirrhosis and sarcopenia awaiting liver transplantation. The trial was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 was double blind, placebo-controlled with participants randomized 1:1, to receive either oral LPCN 1148 or placebo. This was followed by Stage 2, a 28-week single-arm open label extension. The publication reports the analyses from the Stage 1 readout.\n\nThe results at 24 weeks showed that LPCN 1148 therapy resulted in a significant improvement in sarcopenia when compared with placebo. Furthermore, despite most participants already on background therapies for HE, participants receiving LPCN 1148 also experienced significantly fewer episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) compared to those on placebo. Additional beneficial effects of LPCN 1148, including improved muscle quality, hemoglobin, and patient reported symptom improvement are also covered in the manuscript.\n\nThe publication was discussed at The Liver Meeting during 'The Editors Cut: Clinical Studies' session. This session critically discusses the most notable, influential, cutting edge, game changing clinical research papers published during the past year.\n\n\"We are pleased to publish the results from this important proof-of-concept study of LPCN 1148 in Hepatology, a leading peer-reviewed journal,\" said Benjamin Bruno, Ph.D., Pharm.D., Vice President of Clinical Development at Lipocine and lead author on the publication. \"To our knowledge, LPCN 1148 therapy is the first pharmacologic agent to demonstrate improvements in both sarcopenia and overt HE outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. Our findings support further research on the efficacy of LPCN 1148 in managing cirrhosis complications, a critical unmet medical need.\"\n\nFor more information on the study, refer to [ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04874350](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304805-1&h=2129835040&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04874350%3Ftab%3Dresults&a=ClinicalTrials.gov+NCT04874350).\n\n**About Cirrhosis**\n\nCirrhosis is an end stage liver disease of varying etiologies such as alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and primary cholangitis. Complications of cirrhosis include decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy due to systemic ammonia buildup, variceal bleeding, and ascites, which require frequent hospitalizations. In addition, many patients exhibit sarcopenia (low muscle mass). \n\nOver 382,000 patients have been diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis in the US, with few options for managing their disease other than liver transplant. Poor quality of life is common while waiting for a liver transplant. Although there is a limited supply of donor livers, transplant is the only cure for end-stage cirrhosis.\n\n**About OHE**\n\nOHE is a frequent complication and one of the most debilitating manifestations of liver disease, severely affecting the lives of patients and their caregivers. For patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and sarcopenia, clinical outcomes tend to be worse - both sarcopenia and myosteatosis are associated with an increased risk of OHE.\n\nOHE is an episodic neurological disorder with a high recurrence rate. Up to 50% of patients with cirrhosis will experience an OHE episode in their lifetime. Patients can exhibit global neurological, psychiatric, and musculoskeletal deficits. HE has a complex pathophysiology that includes impairment of ammonia clearance and increased inflammatory cytokine and HE recurrence is common, despite use of standard-of-care therapies. Options for prevention/treatment are limited, resulting in significant enduring unmet medical need as the 1-year survival for patients with OHE is ~50%. Furthermore, cognitive impairment associated with cirrhosis results in utilization of more health care resources.\n\n**About LPCN 1148**\n\nLPCN 1148 comprises testosterone dodecanoate, a unique androgen receptor agonist. It is targeted as a differentiated intervention option with a novel multimodal MOA to elicit potential benefits in management of cirrhosis and associated comorbidities of cirrhosis.\n\n**About Lipocine**\n\nLipocine is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to augment therapeutics through effective oral delivery to develop differentiated products. Lipocine has drug candidates in development as well as drug candidates for which we are exploring partnerships. Our drug candidates represent enablement of differentiated, patient friendly oral delivery options for favorable benefit to risk profile which target large addressable markets with significant unmet medical needs.\n\nLipocine's clinical development candidates include: LPCN 1154, oral brexanolone, for the potential treatment of postpartum depression, LPCN 2101 for the potential treatment of epilepsy, LPCN 2203 an oral candidate targeted for the management of essential tremor, LPCN 2401 an oral proprietary anabolic androgen receptor agonist, as an adjunct therapy to incretin mimetics, as an aid for improved body composition in obesity management and LPCN 1148, a novel androgen receptor agonist prodrug for oral administration targeted for the management of symptoms associated with liver cirrhosis. Lipocine is exploring partnering opportunities for LPCN 1107, our candidate for prevention of preterm birth, LPCN 1154, for rapid relief of postpartum depression, LPCN 2401 for obesity management, LPCN 1148, for the management of decompensated cirrhosis, and LPCN 1144, our candidate for treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH.

In the third quarter of 2023, the company recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of variable consideration for minimum guaranteed royalties of $3.1 million related to the termination of the Antares License Agreement.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease was a result of a decrease in TLANDO related costs, a decrease in contract research organization expense and outside consulting costs related to the wind down of the LPCN 1148 study in 2024, and a decrease in costs related to LPCN 1154 clinical studies, offset by increases in personnel related costs and other research and development related costs and supplies.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.0 million in each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Lipocine had $19.8 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities compared to $22.0 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended, September 30 2024, Financial Results**\n\nLipocine reported a net loss of $1.8 million, or ($0.33) per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a net loss of $14.1 million, or ($2.72) per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nRevenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were $7.7 million, primarily consisting of licensing revenue received from our Verity License Agreement, in addition to TLANDO royalty revenue of $206,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the company recognized a non-cash revenue reversal of variable consideration for minimum guaranteed royalties of $3.1 million relating to the termination of the Antares License Agreement offset by licensing revenue of approximately $55,000 for payments received related to the Spriaso license agreement.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $6.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease was a result of a decrease in contract research organization expense and outside consulting costs related to the wind down of the LPCN 1148 study in 2024, a decrease in TLANDO related costs, a decrease in personnel related costs, and a decrease in other research and development related costs. These decreases were offset an increase in costs related to the LPCN 1154 clinical studies.\n\nGeneral administrative expenses were $4.1 million and $3.8 million respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was a result of increases in business development expenses, corporate legal fees and director fees, offset by decreases in corporate insurance expense, professional fees, other administrative consulting fees, personnel related costs, and travel related costs.\n\nFor more information on Lipocine's financial results, refer to Form 10-Q filed by the Company with the SEC.\n\n**About Lipocine**\n\nLipocine is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to augment therapeutics through effective oral delivery to develop differentiated products.

(NASDAQ: LPCN), a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to augment therapeutics through effective oral delivery, today announced positive data from its qEEG study of its oral brexanolone, a proprietary bioidentical NAS being developed for the treatment of post-partum depression (PPD). Changes in spectral power (a quantitative measure of the strength or intensity of specific brain wave frequencies) are frequently used to characterize the effects of drug candidates and may have utility in indication and dose selection in CNS clinical trials. The results indicate robust central nervous system (CNS) activity of oral brexanolone, with concentration- and time-dependent post-dose changes in qEEG. These results confirm GABAA positive allosteric modulation and support future development of oral brexanolone in neuropsychiatric indications.\n\n\"We are pleased with the qEEG results that confirm target engagement of oral bioidentical brexanolone, which suggests potential utility in treating numerous psychiatry indications, including depression and anxiety, and neurology indications such as essential tremor and epilepsy,\" said Dr. Mahesh Patel, President and CEO of Lipocine Inc. \"These positive biomarker results and favorable safety profile support further development of oral brexanolone.\"\n\n  * Loading...\n\n\n\n\n[Previous Item](#prev \"Previous\")[Next Item](#next \"Next\")\n\n  * ![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2527341/Lipocine_table.jpg?w=600)\n\n[](https://ir.lipocine.com/2024-10-10-Lipocine-Announces-Positive-Oral-Brexanolone-Quantitative-EEG-Results#assets_3:2)\n\n[View File](https://ir.lipocine.com/2024-10-10-Lipocine-Announces-Positive-Oral-Brexanolone-Quantitative-EEG-Results#assets_3:2) [Download File](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2527341/Lipocine_table.jpg?p=original)\n\nLipocine-table \n\n\n\n\nThis Phase 1 study evaluated qEEG spectral power changes after administration of oral brexanolone. Healthy postmenopausal females (N=12) were administered single doses of oral brexanolone. EEG recordings and blood samples were collected pre- and post-dose (2, 4 and 12 hours). EEG recordings were obtained using a wireless, 19-electrode EEG monitoring device (Zeto Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Spectral analysis was performed and EEG band amplitudes were analyzed for the oscillatory spectra. Pre-dose-adjusted spectral power values at each single-electrode location were determined for each post-dose timepoint.\n\nFollowing a single clinically relevant dose of oral brexanolone, subjects showed mean changes in all oscillatory spectral power bands. As shown in Fig. 1, theta and alpha1 band power were significantly increased in posterior cortical regions, while alpha2 band power decreased. There was considerable beta band amplitude increase, including significant increase in beta2 amplitude across all cortical brain areas Most of the treatment-related EEG changes were rapid occurring as early as 2 hours, with maximum and significant mean contrast values at 4 hours post dose (consistent with Tmax) with appreciable effects lasting 12 hours post-dose.\n\n[![Figure 1. Topographic plot of oscillatory* spectral power change from baseline \\(pre-dose\\). *Eyes Closed](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2527341/Lipocine_table.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2527341/Lipocine_table.html)\n\nThe observed qEEG changes following oral brexanolone administration are consistent with therapies effective in managing depression, anxiety, tremor, and seizures.1-5\n\nOral brexanolone was well-tolerated in this Phase 1 study. The safety profile was consistent with safety data from clinical studies previously conducted by Lipocine with minimal CNS depressant effects.\n\nLipocine plans to present the additional details and analyses from this EEG study at upcoming scientific meetings.\n\n**About Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG)**\n\nQuantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG) is an advanced neuroimaging technique used to measure electrical activity in the brain with a high degree of precision and detail. qEEG uses mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the electrical signals generated by the brain and convert them into quantitative metrics. By translating these signals into a digital format, qEEG allows for the identification and assessment of specific brain wave frequencies -- such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves -- associated with different states of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This analysis allows researchers to detect subtle changes in brain function that may be induced by a drug, providing important insights into its mechanism of action. In the context of drug development, qEEG is used to evaluate the effect of new therapies on the central nervous system (CNS) by monitoring shifts in brain wave patterns that correlate with therapeutic outcomes. This helps determine whether the drug is acting on the desired neural circuits, provides early evidence of efficacy, and may support dose selection for future clinical trials.\n\n**About Lipocine**\n\nLipocine is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to augment therapeutics through effective oral delivery to develop differentiated products. Lipocine has drug candidates in development as well as drug candidates for which we are exploring partnerships. Our drug candidates represent enablement of differentiated, patient friendly oral delivery options for favorable benefit to risk profile which target large addressable markets with significant unmet medical needs.\n\nLipocine's clinical development candidates include: LPCN 1154, oral brexanolone, for the potential treatment of postpartum depression, LPCN 2101 for the potential treatment of epilepsy, LPCN 2203 an oral candidate targeted for the management of essential tremor, LPCN 2401 an oral proprietary anabolic androgen receptor agonist, as an adjunct therapy to incretin mimetics, as an aid for improved body composition in obesity management and LPCN 1148, a novel androgen receptor agonist prodrug for oral administration targeted for the management of symptoms associated with liver cirrhosis.
