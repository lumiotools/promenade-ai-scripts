Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results \n\n← You are here\n\n## \n\nCepton, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n11/7/2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/8996/pdf)\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 7, 2024-- Cepton, Inc. (“Cepton”) (Nasdaq: CPTN), a Silicon Valley innovator and leader in high performance lidar solutions, today announced its business updates and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“As we enter the fourth and final quarter of 2024, we are making significant strides in the commercialization of our lidar technology,” said Jun Pei, Cepton’s Co-Founder and CEO. “With an RFQ with a Top 10 global automotive OEM for our long-range lidar in its final stages and a growing pipeline of opportunities, we are well-positioned to further strengthen our leadership in the automotive lidar market. Additionally, the recently announced acquisition by Koito underscores our shared vision for long-term growth and innovation. As we work toward completing this transaction, our focus remains on executing our strategy, deepening OEM partnerships, and driving the adoption of our advanced lidar solutions across key industries.” \n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * On July 29, 2024, Cepton signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the acquisition by KOITO MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. (“Koito”) (TSE: 7276) of all of the outstanding common stock of Cepton not owned by Koito for $3.17 per share in an all-cash transaction, other than those shares expected to be contributed to a wholly owned subsidiary of Koito by certain executives of Cepton. The proposed transaction with Koito is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to approval of our stockholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. \n  * Continued execution for the final phase of long-range lidar RFQ with a Top 10 global automotive OEM. \n  * Continued execution for our OEM awarded business for near-range lidar development. \n  * Achieved next major milestone for near-range lidar industrial vehicles business. \n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n_Revenue_\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 total revenue was $0.5 million, compared to $3.8 million in the prior year comparable quarter, a decrease of $3.3 million. \n\n\n\n_Net Loss, Non-GAAP Net Loss, and Per Share Data_\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP net loss was $10.6 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $11.8 million, or $(0.73) per share, basic and diluted. \n  * Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP net loss was $7.5 million. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $8.6 million, or $(0.53) per share, basic and diluted. \n\n\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $(8.0) million. \n\n\n\n**No Conference Call This Quarter**\n\nDue to the previously announced entry into the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Koito on July 29, 2024 and the pendency of the proposed transaction, which remains subject to stockholder approval and the satisfaction of or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of other specified closing conditions, Cepton will not host an earnings conference call this quarter. \n\n**About Cepton, Inc.**\n\nCepton is a Silicon Valley innovator of lidar-based solutions for automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications.

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. The statements included above as well as any other statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “objective,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “milestone,” “designed to,” “proposed” or other similar expressions that predict or imply future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Cepton cautions readers of this press release that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Cepton’s control, that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding the Company’s expectations, plans and opinions regarding the proposed transaction with Koito, statements, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, statements regarding potential benefits and the commercial attractiveness to its customers of Cepton’s products and services, the potential success of Cepton’s marketing and expansion strategies, and the potential for Cepton to achieve design awards. \n\nThese statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Cepton’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including (1) Cepton’s proposed transaction with Koito, including its ability to close such proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all; (2) the conditions affecting the markets in which Cepton operates; (3) the success of Cepton’s strategic relationships, including with Koito, which is not exclusive; (4) fluctuations in sales by Cepton’s major customers; (5) fluctuations in capital spending in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets; (6) negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, the effects of public health crises, and the potential impact of geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; (7) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (8) the possibility that Cepton’s business may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors; (9) the risk that current trends in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets decelerate or do not continue; (10) errors or material differences in Cepton’s estimates and expectations for its financial performance and growth, including when Cepton will generate positive cash flow from operations; (11) risks relating to the uncertainty of projected financial and operating information, including whether Cepton will be able to achieve its target milestones, its pricing and sales volume targets, and win the engagements contemplated in its projected pipeline, and the ability of OEMs and other strategic partners to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs; (12) risks related to future market adoption of Cepton’s offerings; (13) risks related to Cepton’s marketing and growth strategies; (14) the effects of competition on Cepton’s future business; (15) Cepton’s ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future; (16) Cepton’s ability to raise funding on reasonable terms as necessary to develop its products in the timeframe contemplated by its business plan, and to comply with the terms of any restrictive, financial or other covenants in the agreements governing such funding, including the consent and other rights granted to Koito as part of Koito’s convertible preferred stock investment; (17) Cepton’s ability to execute its business plans and strategy; (18) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Cepton, including any related to the business combination with Growth Capital Acquisition Corp.; (19) risks related to the new series production award differing from Cepton’s expectations, or that the arrangement can be terminated or may not materialize into a long-term contract partnership arrangement, and the new engineering services contract with Koito relating thereto; and (20) the other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the reports and documents Cepton files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. If any of these risks materialize or any of Cepton’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Cepton does not presently know or that Cepton currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Cepton’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Cepton anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Cepton’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. Cepton undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. \n\nActual results, performance or achievements may, and are likely to, differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements were based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Cepton’s control. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Non-GAAP net loss and adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP net loss is defined as GAAP net loss excluding stock-based compensation, gain from project cancellation cost recovery, contingent loss, non-recurring transaction expenses, gain on sales of property and equipment, gain or loss on changes in fair value of earnout liability and warrants, foreign currency transaction loss, net, and loss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the cancellation of the GM series production award in December 2023, Cepton submitted a project investment cost recovery claim and realized a gain from project cancellation cost recovery in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cepton also incurred a contingent loss from the project loss claims from our contract manufacturers affected by the GM series production award cancellation. Both the gain from project cancellation loss recovery and the contingent loss from project loss claims are excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP net loss. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as non-GAAP net loss before interest income or expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. \n\nCepton believes these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Cepton’s financial condition and results of operations. Cepton believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating actual and projected operating results and trends in comparing Cepton’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Cepton also believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and analysts in assessing our operating performance during the periods these charges were incurred on a consistent basis with the periods during which these charges were not incurred. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an inference that our future results and financial position will be unaffected by unusual items. Cepton does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and other amounts that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Cepton’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and other amounts are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**CEPTON, INC.

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. The statements included above as well as any other statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “objective,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “milestone,” “designed to,” “proposed” or other similar expressions that predict or imply future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Cepton cautions readers of this press release that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Cepton’s control, that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, statements regarding potential benefits and the commercial attractiveness to its customers of Cepton’s products and services, the potential success of Cepton’s marketing and expansion strategies, and the potential for Cepton to achieve design awards. \n\nThese statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Cepton’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including (1) Cepton’s pending transaction with Koito, including its ability to close such transaction in a timely manner or at all; (2) the conditions affecting the markets in which Cepton operates; (3) the success of Cepton’s strategic relationships, including with Koito, which is not exclusive; (4) fluctuations in sales by Cepton’s major customers; (5) fluctuations in capital spending in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets; (6) negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, the effects of public health crises, and the potential impact of geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; (7) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (8) the possibility that Cepton’s business may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors; (9) the risk that current trends in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets decelerate or do not continue; (10) errors or material differences in Cepton’s estimates and expectations for its financial performance and growth, including when Cepton will generate positive cash flow from operations; (11) risks relating to the uncertainty of projected financial and operating information, including whether Cepton will be able to achieve its target milestones, its pricing and sales volume targets, and win the engagements contemplated in its projected pipeline, and the ability of OEMs and other strategic partners to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs; (12) risks related to future market adoption of Cepton’s offerings; (13) risks related to Cepton’s marketing and growth strategies; (14) the effects of competition on Cepton’s future business; (15) Cepton’s ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future; (16) Cepton’s ability to raise funding on reasonable terms as necessary to develop its products in the timeframe contemplated by its business plan, and to comply with the terms of any restrictive, financial or other covenants in the agreements governing such funding, including the consent and other rights granted to Koito as part of Koito’s convertible preferred stock investment; (17) Cepton’s ability to execute its business plans and strategy; (18) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Cepton, including any related to the business combination with Growth Capital Acquisition Corp.; (19) risks related to the new series production award differing from Cepton’s expectations, or that the arrangement can be terminated or may not materialize into a long-term contract partnership arrangement, and the new engineering services contract with Koito relating thereto; and (20) the other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the reports and documents Cepton files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. If any of these risks materialize or any of Cepton’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Cepton does not presently know or that Cepton currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Cepton’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Cepton anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Cepton’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. Cepton undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. \n\nActual results, performance or achievements may, and are likely to, differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements were based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Cepton’s control. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Non-GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP net income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, realizable gain from series production award cancellation loss recovery, non-recurring transaction expenses, gain on sales of property and equipment, gain or loss on changes in fair value of earnout liability and warrants, foreign currency transaction loss, net, and loss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the cancellation of the GM series production award in December 2023, Cepton submitted a project investment cost recovery claim and realized a gain from project cancellation cost recovery in the six months ended June 30, 2024. This gain is excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Non-GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. \n\nCepton believes these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Cepton’s financial condition and results of operations. Cepton believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating actual and projected operating results and trends in comparing Cepton’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Cepton also believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and analysts in assessing our operating performance during the periods these charges were incurred on a consistent basis with the periods during which these charges were not incurred. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an inference that our future results and financial position will be unaffected by unusual items. Cepton does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and other amounts that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Cepton’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and other amounts are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**CEPTON, INC.

(“Cepton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CPTN), a Silicon Valley innovator and leader in [high performance lidar solutions](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cepton.com%2Fproducts-overview&esheet=54097787&newsitemid=20240729802746&lan=en-US&anchor=high+performance+lidar+solutions&index=1&md5=7ada034319f8638c456f3dcba6dc3275), announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) providing for the acquisition by KOITO MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. (“Koito”) (TSE: 7276), a leading automotive tier one supplier, of all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company not owned by Koito for $3.17 per share in an all-cash transaction. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240729802746/en/>\n\nCepton stockholders will receive $3.17 per share in cash, which represents a premium of approximately 25.3% to the closing price as of Friday, July 26, 2024. The material terms of the transaction will be described in Cepton’s current report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. \n\nThe proposed transaction will complement Koito’s existing sensor technology roadmap, while providing Cepton with the financial stability and scalability that are crucial to the commercialization of its lidar technology. After the transaction, Cepton will operate as a privately held indirect subsidiary of Koito in the U.S.\n\n“I am excited about the next stage of Cepton’s growth as we embark on a new journey together with Koito,” said Dr. Jun Pei, CEO and Co-founder of Cepton. “Over the past few years, we have achieved many remarkable milestones in product innovation and development, establishing ourselves as one of the most trusted lidar solutions providers in the automotive industry. A significant portion of our efforts were greatly supported by Koito as our long-term partner and investor. \n\n“As we carry on our pioneering spirit as a Silicon Valley company and deepen our commitment to driving cutting-edge innovation, leaning on Koito’s century-old heritage of engineering rigor will heighten our dedication to delivering quality solutions to customers worldwide. Our partnership with Koito will provide us with unique access to a broader range of opportunities and resources and help us stay resilient to industry challenges in a way no other lidar company can. This will position us as a leading automotive lidar company for years to come, as Cepton continues to execute current automotive programs and actively manage future OEM initiatives.” \n\nMichiaki Kato, President and COO of Koito, said: “We appreciate and are impressed by the outstanding technical capabilities exhibited by the Cepton team throughout our years of collaboration. We recognize this proposed transaction is an essential step toward realization of Koito’s vision of ‘lighting the way for our sustainable future.’ We are convinced that having Cepton as a member of the Koito group will significantly enhance the competitiveness of our sensor business. \n\nUnder our corporate message of ‘Lighting for Your Safety,’ Koito has been contributing to realizing a safe and secure mobility society through ‘light’ in the field of automotive lighting equipment and other products. By adding lidar, a sensor that uses ‘light,’ to our product lineup, we will contribute to safety and security in the next-generation mobility society where ADAS and autonomous driving become popular, and we will aim for sustainable corporate growth by providing even higher value-added products through synergy between automotive lighting equipment and sensor technology.” \n\nMitch Hourtienne, Chief Commercial Officer at Cepton, adds: “In addition to broadening business platforms for both Koito and Cepton, we expect our partnership to make a positive impact on the overall automotive lidar ecosystem, driving industry standards and accelerating adoption at scale. We are ready to better support our automotive OEM customers in safely deploying lidar-enhanced assisted and autonomous driving platforms through a streamlined and stabilized supply chain, making safe autonomy truly available in every consumer vehicle.” \n\nO’Melveny and Myers LLP is acting as legal advisor to the Company. Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to a special committee of disinterested and independent members of the Company’s board of directors and Cooley LLP is acting as legal advisor to the special committee. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Nishimura & Asahi (Gaikokuho Kyodo Jigyo) are acting as legal advisors to Koito. WTW is acting as HR advisor to Koito. \n\n**Closing Conditions and Timing**\n\nThe Transaction, which has been approved by each company’s Board of Directors and recommended to Cepton’s stockholders by Cepton’s Board of Directors, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to approval of Cepton’s stockholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. \n\n**Additional Information about the Proposed Transaction and Where to Find It**\n\nThis communication relates to the proposed transaction (the “Transaction”) involving Cepton, Inc.
