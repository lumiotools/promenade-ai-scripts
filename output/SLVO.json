While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations\nand objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, as\nwell as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to\nshortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of\nsanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is\nexpected to take between three and five years and presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about\nforward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its\ncost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher\nmarket volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group;\n(iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency\nexchange rates, deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade\npolicies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings\nof UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit\nSuisse Group; (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-\nspecific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration,\nconstraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory\nrequirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments;\n(viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current\ngeopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect\nUBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when\ninteracting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and\nregulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation,\nregulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular\ncross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which\nmay be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi)\nUBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii)\nlimitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial\ncrime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and non-nation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make\npayments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of\ntheir broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital\nreturn objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the\npossibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood,\nearthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g., the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such\nas the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core\nassets, the existing assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the\ntransaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our\nreputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our\nbusiness and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

UBS\nThe acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group made 2023 an exceptional year in our firm’s history. We completed the\nfirst-ever combination of two global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) and have embarked on a\nmajor program to integrate the two banks. Our sustainability frameworks are no exception. We have made\nsignificant progress in aligning our frameworks for the combined firm and will continue with this alignment in 2024\nand beyond. 2023 also saw significant developments in corporate disclosure requirements, particularly the\nEuropean Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the CSRD), as well as in the availability of emissions\ndata and standards. In addition, market volatility and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East presented new\nchallenges for sustainable investing.\nIntegration of Credit Suisse\nWe have made significant progress in integrating UBS and Credit Suisse’s sustainability policy frameworks and\nprocesses:\n– We have implemented a revised sustainability and climate risk policy framework and associated processes to\nreflect the full suite of activities of the combined business and a consistent approach.\n– We are minimizing our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through energy efficiencies and by\nswitching to more sustainable energy sources, across the combined firm.\n– We have developed updated scope 3 emissions targets reflecting the combined profile of the combined firm and\nevolving regulatory and data standards. We have updated our previous emissions targets for real estate mortgage\nlending, as well as the fossil fuels, power generation and cement sectors, reflecting both the combined portfolios\nof the two firms and methodology changes. We have added targets for shipping, and iron and steel based on\nthe materiality of these sectors in our combined financing portfolio and have dropped sectors that are not\nmaterial.\n– We have made progress towards the alignment of our sustainable investing products standards across the firm\nand will benchmark Credit Suisse’s products against these standards. We expect to incorporate products that\nmeet our standards across our platforms in 2024.\n– We have integrated our performance evaluation and compensation structures, including our fair pay practice.\nWe are also aligning social plans or severance payments at UBS and Credit Suisse in the respective country to\nensure that all employees are treated equally.\nWe still have significant milestones to deliver in 2024 and beyond. We firmly believe, however, that our activities\nare already strengthening our creation of long-term value for our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders. As\nwe progress with the integration, we aim to leverage the most effective ideas and capabilities of both organizations\nas we strive to build a highly dependable and trustworthy firm globally.\nWe strongly believe that institutions are defined by their culture and, with our “three keys to success”, we have an\nestablished concept for advancing the culture across our combined organization. Our culture is decisive in achieving\nour ambitions, and client centricity, accountability with integrity, collaboration, and risk management are all areas\nwhere our combined strengths can make the biggest difference and as such, are a key priority.\nWe continued to make good progress on the execution of our Group-wide sustainability and impact strategy in\n2023, as outlined in this Sustainability Report. While market volatility and rising geopolitical tensions over the course\nof 2023 proved challenging, flows into sustainable funds and ETFs remained positive. Sustainable investing also\ngained ground in alternative markets, including real estate and hedge funds. Against this backdrop, we saw\nsustainable assets under management increase. Overall, our efforts across sustainability and culture have been\nreflected in solid results in key environmental, social, governance (ESG) ratings.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 33\nTrends\nPolicymakers and regulators increasingly require corporations to embed ESG considerations within their own\noperations and value chains, and to disclose them. One example of this is the CSRD, which came into effect in\n2023 and will require compliant reporting within annual financial reporting for the first wave of in-scope entities\nfor fiscal year 2024, with reporting in 2025. While we welcome this move toward greater transparency and\nreliability of information, we continue to seek greater alignment across existing and emerging disclosure\nrequirements in order to enable greater comparability.\nWhile climate continues to dominate the sustainable finance landscape, there has been a notable shift in emphasis.\nAfter two years of formulating and refining net-zero commitments across industries, the ongoing progress in\nmethodologies, data and transition finance frameworks has allowed discussions to shift toward the quality and\nambition level of net-zero targets. Transition has become more widely recognized as a requisite path. As our clients\nlook to a shift in their business models to prepare for the future, the fast pace of technological innovation, along\nwith high inflation and input costs, are key considerations as they develop their transition strategies.\nEmerging trends which have all gained momentum in 2023 include nature, impact transparency and blended\nfinance. The most advanced of these is nature where there has been a growing awareness of the impact of society\non the world’s biodiversity and natural capital. New frameworks are being rolled out to enhance transparency,\nincluding the release of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (the TNFD).\nThis will improve the availability of good, economy-wide nature and biodiversity data, contributing toward greater\ntransparency and providing an important tool for investors and companies alike.\nTurning to impact, the increasing disclosure requirements and growing demand for transparency from clients are\nencouraging the development of new measurement methodologies. In the last year, we have also seen\ngovernments and development finance institutions launch blended finance initiatives, using capital from public or\nphilanthropic sources to increase private sector investment in sustainable development. In the past decade, such\ninitiatives have mobilized over USD 200 billion in capital toward sustainable development in developing countries\nand we see significant opportunity for this to grow further.\nOur commitment\nBy 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope\n3 activities. We recognize there is more to do and aim to phase in additional scope 3 activities over time. It is, however,\nimportant to note that the decarbonization of the global economy, emissions reductions by clients, and the realization\nof our own targets and ambitions all depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our direct influence.\nThe decarbonization of the global economy will require governments, regulators, all industries and consumers to\nmove in the same direction. Clear guidance by governments through thoughtful regulations, policies and incentives,\nincluding mechanisms to factor in the price of carbon, as well as the development and scaling of key technologies\nand broader changes in the behavior of our society, will be critical.\nOur ambition to be a global leader in sustainability remains unchanged. We are committed to supporting our clients\nin the transition to a low-carbon world, leading by example in our own operations, and sharing our lessons learned\nalong the way with the rest of the world. We hope you will join us on the journey.\nColm Kelleher Sergio P. Ermotti\nChairman of the Board of Directors Group Chief Executive Officer\nUBS was among the 43 companies that first signed the UN Global Compact in 2000 and is also a member of the\nUN Global Compact Network Switzerland, meaning we are committed to its principles on human rights, labor\nstandards, the environment and anti-corruption. As reflected in detail in this report, we have a comprehensive set\nof goals and activities in place pertaining to the principles of the UN Global Compact.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 44\nAbout this report\nOverview\nThe reporting period for this UBS Group Sustainability Report, which also covers Credit Suisse, is 1 January to 31\nDecember 2023, which is aligned with the financial reporting period of UBS Group AG. All 2023 data included in\nthe report is therefore for this period. Historical data (for e.g., 2022 and 2021) pertains to Pre-acquisition UBS,\nunless otherwise stated. For UBS’s own environmental footprint, the reporting period has changed from July to\nJune (as applied in the UBS Sustainability Report 2022) to January to December (for this report) to align with the\nUBS financial reporting year. 2022 data is restated in the relevant tables. Data showing progress against our\ndecarbonization sectorial targets, including net-zero ones, pertains to 31 December 2022 (due to the unavailability\nof relevant 2023 data, as explained in the respective section of this report).\nUnless otherwise noted, the information included in this report is presented at the consolidated level for UBS Group\nAG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG.\n› Refer to “Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities” in the UBS Group AG Annual Report 2023 for\nsupplementary information regarding certain significant subsidiaries\nThis report comprises the “non-financial” disclosures required for UBS Group AG, and its subsidiaries, including\nUBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, under the Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 964b. It also comprises disclosures required\nfor UBS AG by the German law implementing EU directive 2014/95 (CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz / CSR-RUG)\n(nichtfinanzieller Konzernbericht) (the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive). A table at the end of this report\n(Appendix 4) provides the references to such non-financial information. This report also contains information on\nUBS AG and UBS Europe SE pursuant to Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Appendix 4).\nUBS is in the process of implementing a combined and aligned sustainability-and-climate-risk dataset across UBS\nGroup and including Credit Suisse AG. For this reason, UBS will publish UBS Group and Credit Suisse AG\nsustainability and climate risk metrics required pursuant to FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure – banks\", Annex 5,\nin a supplement to the UBS Group Annual Report and the UBS Group Sustainability Report in line with the\npublication timeline for the semi-annual Pillar 3 disclosures in the third quarter of 2024. The current inventory of\nquantitative sustainability and climate risk metrics, including exposure to carbon-related assets, climate-sensitive\nsectors and nature-related risks for UBS AG, is disclosed in this report.\nAdditional information pertaining to the content of this report is provided in a supplementary document. All\nclimate- and nature-related information contained in this report and in the supplementary document is also made\navailable through a separate UBS Group Climate and Nature Report 2023. The latter report follows the structure\nrecommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD)1 and also leverages the\nframework of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures.\n› Refer to the “Supplement to Managing sustainability and climate risks” section of the Supplement to this report,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for information on the implementation of the environmental risk\nregulations in Singapore and the Hong Kong SAR by both UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG and disclosures in\nconnection with the legal entity reporting requirements of the ESG Sourcebook in the Business Standards section\nof the UK Financial Conduct Authority Handbook, and for information pertaining to UBS Group AG’s approach to\nthe “Swiss Ordinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in relation to Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Affected\nAreas and Child Labor”\nOur Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) index and our Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB)\nreporting and self-assessment are available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting.\n› Refer to “Key terms and definitions” in the appendices to this report for terms and abbreviations used in this report\nCredit Suisse integration – explanations and related assumptions\nOn 12 June 2023, UBS Group AG acquired Credit Suisse Group AG, succeeding by operation of Swiss law to all\nassets and liabilities of Credit Suisse Group AG, and became the direct or indirect shareholder of all of the former\ndirect and indirect subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group AG. UBS Group AG is a holding company and conducts\nsubstantially all of its operations through UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, and subsidiaries thereof. UBS aims to\nsubstantially complete the integration of Credit Suisse into UBS by the end of 2026. As part of the integration of\nCredit Suisse, UBS plans to simplify the legal structure, including the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG\nplanned for 2024.\n1 In June 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (the ISSB) finalized its first set of requirements for corporate disclosures regarding sustainability\nmatters: IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. The standards incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD).\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 55\nIn compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, information on Credit Suisse AG has been included in the\nUBS Group Sustainability Report 2023.\n› Refer to “Appendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit Suisse AG” in the appendices to this report for more\ninformation about Credit Suisse AG disclosures.\nThe legal structure of the UBS Group\nThe chart below gives an overview of our principal legal entities and our legal entity structure.\nUBS Group AG\n100%\nUBS AG (sub-)consolidated Credit Suisse AG (sub-)consolidated Other\nparticipations\nUBS AG Credit Suisse AG\n100% 100% 98% UBS Business\nSolutions AG\nUBS UBS Americas UBS Asset Other non-US Credit Suisse Credit Suisse Credit Suisse\nUBS Europe SE\nSwitzerland AG Holding LLC Management AG subsidiaries¹ (Schweiz) AG Holdings (USA), Inc.

We are supporting our clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy, leading by example in our own\noperations, and sharing our lessons learned along the way with the rest of the world. By 2050, our ambition is to\nachieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities.\nContinued ambition to be a global leader in sustainability\nThe acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group enlarged our exposure to sustainability matters, as reflected in the\nincreased qualitative and quantitative content we are disclosing in this Sustainability Report. Since the acquisition,\nwe have been working to progressively align governance, policies, methodologies and frameworks. We expect to\ncomplete this work during 2024. Our ongoing alignment includes making UBS sustainable product standards the\nbenchmark, with Credit Suisse’s sustainable financing and investment products undergoing a detailed assessment\nto ensure compliance with our standards, frameworks and expectations.

The metrics include transactions such as, but not limited to,\nInvestment Bank Global Banking bonds issued under the voluntary ICMA Green Bond Principles, Sustainability Bond Principles, and Sustainability-Linked Bond\nPrinciples. The principles include a recommendation that the issuer appoints an external review provider to undertake an independent external review (e.g.,\nsecond-party opinion). This is consistent with market practice. The metrics also include sustainability-themed bonds (e.g., Transition). Transactions are counted\nonly once, there is no double counting (e.g., if and where UBS AG and Credit Suisse were involved in the same transaction). UBS has performed an assessment\nfor Credit Suisse green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds reported in this report and deemed them to be aligned to UBS sustainable bond\nguidelines.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 88\nOur integration journey – at a glance\nFollowing the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG by UBS Group AG on 12 June 2023, we implemented integration\nmeasures across our sustainability and culture activities. We have set out key measures in the table below.\nStrategy Sustainability and impact strategy applies Group-wide\n– The sustainability and impact strategy of Pre-acquisition UBS applies to UBS Group, including Credit Suisse. While certain\nsustainability-related policies, processes and activities continued at Credit Suisse AG, they are applied within the overarching strategy\nof UBS Group.\nGovernance Senior level governance spans the entire Group\n– The responsibility for sustainability of UBS Group AG’s Board of Directors (the BoD) spans the entire Group, including Credit Suisse\nAG. The five committees that support the BoD each have specific ESG (environmental, social, governance)-related responsibilities, with\nthe Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) having primary responsibility for overseeing our Group-wide\nsustainability and impact strategy.\n– The Group CEO has delegated responsibility for setting the sustainability and impact strategy and developing Group-wide\nsustainability and impact objectives, in agreement with fellow GEB members, to the Group Executive Board (GEB) Lead for\nSustainability and Impact. The GEB Lead for Sustainability and Impact manages the UBS Group Sustainability and Impact (GSI)\norganization and, together with the Chief Sustainability Officer (the CSO), co-chairs the Group-wide Sustainability and Climate Task\nForce (the SCTF).\n– In 2023, alignment with the Group’s strategies, objectives and guidelines was ensured by UBS personnel being represented on the\ngovernance bodies of Credit Suisse. The overarching governance of sustainability at Credit Suisse AG was integrated into UBS Group\nand certain CS governance bodies were retired. In 2024, we aim to complete the integration of Credit Suisse sustainability governance\nbodies into the UBS Group sustainability governance.\nEnvironment Group-wide ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3\nactivities, by 2050\nFinancing:\n– In 2023, we revised our decarbonization targets to reflect the combined lending portfolios and resulting exposures to carbon-intensive\nsectors.\n– In 2023, we calculated the emissions metrics shown for 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 on the basis of the joint loan\nbooks of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG on those dates, on a pro forma basis.\nInvesting:\n– In 2023, we undertook an extensive review of our approaches to setting decarbonization targets, to reflect the activities of the\ncombined organization and evolving standards and methodologies.\n– In 2023, UBS AG Asset Management made progress toward delivering its 2030 target of aiming to align 20% of UBS AG Asset\nManagement’s total assets under management (AuM) with net zero, using science-based portfolio alignment approaches. This Pre-\nacquisition UBS aspiration will be reassessed in 2024.\nOwn operations:\n– For 2023, we disclosed the environmental footprint of the joint operations of UBS Group, including Credit Suisse, unless otherwise\nstated.\n– We integrated the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculations for the combined firm, with a new joint base year set to\n2019.\n– We integrated Credit Suisse energy consumption in UBS’s 15% reduction target by 2025.\n– For UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, we continued to apply an internal carbon price of USD 400 per metric ton for scope\n1 and 2 emissions in our capital investment business cases in order to incentivize carbon reductions.\nSupply chain:\n– In 2023, we revised and updated the list of GHG key vendors (defined by us as those vendors that collectively account for more than\n50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions) from 83 to 95 to include Credit Suisse vendors.\n– In 2024 and 2025, our requirements to reduce the environmental impact of vendors that provide services from offshore development\ncenters (ODCs), as currently applied to UBS ODC vendors, will be rolled out to Credit Suisse ODC vendors.\nSocial Building a unified culture\nWorkforce\n– In 2023, we achieved the implementation of a combined and fully integrated performance management approach for all employees,\nincluding Credit Suisse.\n– In 2023, we fully integrated former Credit Suisse Group employees into our fair pay practices and continued to monitor and improve\nour pay equity position in our leading countries.\n– For 2023, we are reporting consolidated workforce figures, unless otherwise stated.\n– In 2023, we continued with our DE&I aspirations (for the combined organization) and retired the Credit Suisse DE&I aspirations.\nResponsible supply chain:\n– In 2023, we established a combined spend and vendor inventory for UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. In 2024, the UBS Responsible\nSupply Chain Management framework will be rolled out to Credit Suisse AG (which, in 2023, continued to apply its Third-Party Risk\nManagement due diligence approach.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 99\nSupporting Leveraging the power of the combined firm for the benefit of clients\nopportunities – In 2023, we made UBS sustainable product standards the benchmark going forward, with Credit Suisse AG’s sustainable financing\nand investment products undergoing a detailed assessment to ensure compliance with our standards, frameworks and expectations.\nIn 2024, we intend to fully incorporate Credit Suisse data into our sustainable finance and investing disclosures.\n– For 2023, we reported sustainable investments (SI) for UBS AG. Credit Suisse AG sustainable investing products and associated\ninvested assets continued to be classified under the Credit Suisse AG Sustainable Investing Framework (SIF) and reported separately.\nAll Credit Suisse AG green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds reported were aligned to UBS guidelines.\n– In 2023, the Investment Bank, operating under a single consolidated governance at end-of-year, has combined sustainability\nexpertise from Credit Suisse AG to strengthen UBS Group’s offering across Global Markets, Global Banking and Research. New\nsustainable finance content, products and other services taken over from Credit Suisse AG follow UBS Group standards and approval\nprocess. The Credit Suisse Sustainable Activities Framework, as well as its related external USD 300 billion sustainable finance\ncommitment, was retired.\n– In 2023, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG continued to offer its sustainable products to its clients. The development of new products was\npaused, in light of our review and vetting of the sustainable products of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG against the UBS sustainable\nproduct frameworks.\n– In 2024 and 2025, we will bring selected Credit Suisse sustainable and impact investing solutions onto the merged Global Wealth\nManagement platform. These solutions will be subject to existing UBS Global Wealth Management sustainable investing frameworks,\ndiligence, and instrument selection approaches. During the migration of solutions, clients, and assets, we will phase down dual\ngovernance, with the aim of aligning under the existing UBS Global Wealth Management sustainable investing governance.\n– In 2024, the UBS AG Asset Management SI product classification framework will be applied to the Credit Suisse AG Asset\nManagement products when onboarded to the UBS shelf. A joint governance forum is in place to support the alignment of policies,\nmethodologies and frameworks.\nManaging Combined sustainability and climate risk appetite\nrisks – In 2023, we revised our sustainability and climate risk policy framework and associated processes across UBS Group to reflect the full\nsuite of activities of the combined business and ensure a consistent approach. We enhanced these by adding Credit Suisse standards\nrelevant to the combined bank, for shipping, project finance, and mining.\n– In 2023, Credit Suisse AG’s sector-specific client energy transition framework (CETF) underpinned its climate risk management, until\nits decommissioning at end of year. A Group-wide approach is being developed by the combined firm to assess clients’ energy\ntransition readiness.\n– For 2023, we disclosed climate risk metrics for UBS AG, with Credit Suisse AG climate risk metrics to be published in 2024 when\naligned data is fully available. In 2024, we will also progressively align Credit Suisse AG’s approach to the assessment of climate risk\nmateriality and its risk reporting cycles and metrics with those of UBS AG, in parallel with the integration of underlying processes and\ncontrols.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 1100\nOur business model\nUBS – who we are\nUBS is a leading and truly global wealth manager, enhanced by synergetic investment banking and asset\nmanagement capabilities, and the leading bank in Switzerland. We enable people, institutions and corporations to\nachieve their goals by providing financial advice and solutions. We have a unique capital-generative and well-\ndiversified business model with a strong competitive position in our target markets and an attractive long-term\noutlook on return on capital. Our business model, our strong culture, our respected brand with over 160 years of\nhistory and our capital prudence have made it possible to both grow profits and deliver high return on equity.\nWe are focused on driving sustainable long-term growth while maintaining risk and cost discipline\nOur objective is to generate value for our shareholders and clients by driving sustainable long-term structural\ngrowth, as well as capital returns. To accomplish this, we are building on our scale, content and solutions, while\nremaining disciplined on capital, risk and costs. Maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons remains the foundation\nof our success. This will give us the capacity to invest strategically and will enable us to deliver against our financial\ntargets and commercial ambitions, which are outlined in the “Targets, capital guidance and ambitions” section of\nthe UBS Group Annual Report.\nWe benefit from an attractive business mix, with more than one-third of our risk-weighted assets (RWA) in our\nglobal asset-gathering Global Wealth Management and Asset Management business divisions, which are\nstructurally attractive from the risk, growth and capital consumption perspectives and generate more than half of\nour revenues. Roughly another third of our RWA are in Personal & Corporate Banking in Switzerland, an attractive,\nstable and well-diversified economy with low historic credit losses. Furthermore, we operate a capital-efficient\nInvestment Bank business division, which is limited to less than 25% of Group RWA (excluding Non-core and\nLegacy).\nMoreover, we are aiming to maximize our impact and that of our clients to create long-term sustainable value. We\nalso have a responsibility toward the communities we serve and our employees. We have outlined selected\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) aspirations, which should support our financial and commercial targets.\nThe acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group is accelerating our strategy\nThe acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group enhances our client franchises by increasing scale while adding\ncomplementary capabilities and gaining talent. Our strategic focus remains on building out our leading global\ninvestment platform. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group enables us to combine and optimize our resources\nand to target investments that enable us to provide superior levels of client service. Our geographical growth\nsegments will remain the Americas and Asia Pacific, with Switzerland remaining our home market. The acquisition\nof the Credit Suisse Group will further shift our business mix toward wealth management, asset management and\nour Swiss business. The acquisition also strengthens our investment banking capabilities, without compromising\nour model, as the Investment Bank will consume a limited share of the Group’s RWA.\nWe have a global, diversified business model\nOur invested assets of more than USD 5trn are regionally diversified across the globe. We give our clients access to\na broader, more relevant and customizable range of solutions, which, together with our thought leadership and\ncapabilities, position us well to become their partner of choice. Our strategic ambitions are a reflection of the\noutlook on long-term demographic and social trends affecting wealth distribution, product demand and client\nexperience.\nRegionally, more than half of our wealth management clients’ invested assets are in the US, which is the largest\nwealth pool globally, with solid wealth generation. Here we are a top player, and we are focused on improving\nscale and profitability by deepening our relationships with core clients and by building out our digital-supported\ncapabilities and banking platform.\nIn Asia Pacific, which is the fastest-growing wealth market, we are by far the largest wealth manager1, and we are\nbuilding on that scale to drive growth. We are further developing our businesses in China and working to offer our\ncapabilities in a more cohesive way to our clients in Southeast Asia.\n1 Asian Private Banker, 23 January 2024.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 1111\nIn EMEA, we are focused on improving profitability and driving focused growth by optimizing our domestic\nfootprint and providing holistic coverage for entrepreneurs.\nFinally, in Switzerland, we have a highly integrated business and aim to reinforce our position as the leading bank.\nWe are driving our digital transformation, improving the client experience and focusing on capturing selected\ngrowth opportunities.\nOur growth plans are underpinned by cross-divisional collaboration\nWe want to serve our clients as one firm. The collaboration between our business divisions is critical to the success\nof our strategy and is a source of competitive advantage. This collaboration also provides further revenue growth\npotential and enables us to better meet client needs in our core wealth and global family and institutional wealth\n(GFIW) segments alike. Our Asset Management business division provides clients with a broad offering and exclusive\naccess to premium personalized services, while our investment banking capabilities support our growth plans across\nthe client franchise with unique insights, execution, and risk management. Close collaboration between our\nbusinesses adds value for clients, including access to private markets, alternatives and ESG products, and we are\ncontinuously striving to enhance our holistic client offering.\nClients are at the center of everything we do\nHelping clients to achieve their financial and personal goals is the essence of what we do. We aim to differentiate\nour service by delivering a client experience that is personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless. This is our promise\nto clients.\nWith evolving client needs, we are adapting by making our wealth coverage more needs-based, digital and\neffective. In wealth management, our focus remains on our core wealth and GFIW clients, while expanding our\ncoverage of entrepreneurs, women and the next generation of wealthy individuals. We are launching and scaling\ndigitally customizable services, enhancing personally advised wealth with digital support, and expanding our custom\nofferings for GFIW to cater for the different needs of our clients.\nWe are investing in our technology as an enabler for client experience, simplicity and efficiency\nThe trusted and personal relationship with our clients across our businesses is evolving. Today, our clients expect us\nto provide our services more seamlessly across the firm in a personalized, relevant and timely fashion, with\nincreasing demand for services that are digital first and available anytime and anywhere. This presents an\nopportunity for us to fully embrace technology, through which we aim to differentiate the firm.\nWe continue to invest in technology, such as Artificial Intelligence, with the goals of improving efficiency and\neffectiveness, driving and enhancing growth and better serving our clients. We believe the continued optimization\nof our processes, our platforms, our organization and our capital resources will help us to achieve this.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 1122\nSustainability drives our ambitions\nWe partner with our clients to help them mobilize their capital toward a more sustainable world. Our aim is to meet\nclients’ demands for credible sustainable offerings. We want to be the financial provider of choice for clients that\nwish to mobilize capital toward the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the\norderly transition to a low-carbon economy, including in Switzerland, where, as the leading bank, we are helping\nto finance this transition.\nOur ESG policies and guidelines support the implementation of our sustainability and culture agenda\nOur Code of Conduct and Ethics (the Code) sets out the principles and commitments that define our ethical\nstandards and the way we do business. It outlines UBS’s aspiration to create a fairer, more prosperous society,\nchampion a healthier environment and address inequalities. It also contains our commitment to fulfil compliance\nobligations. We are committed to obeying the laws, rules and regulations of the areas where we live, work and do\nbusiness. The Code covers our dealings with clients, counterparties, shareholders, regulators, business partners and\ncolleagues. It is the basis for our policies, guidelines and procedures, including on environmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) matters.\n› Refer to the “Key policies and principles ” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for the summary of our related key policies and principles\nKey regulatory and market developments impact our approach to sustainability\nDuring 2023, the regulatory and policy agenda on sustainability and climate continued to evolve, as regulators and\nsupervisors increasingly required ESG considerations to be embedded across own operations and value chains.\nExpanding reporting and disclosure requirements and risk management expectations, a growing focus on broader\nsustainability issues including nature, and social impact are all contributing to increased pressure on firms.\nMeanwhile, a regulatory focus on the prevention of greenwashing is fueling initiatives on taxonomies, product\nlabels, ESG data and ratings, and corporate sustainability due diligence.\nA number of important developments relating to corporate sustainability disclosure and reporting standards took\nplace during 2023, including the swift adoption by companies globally of the recommendations of the Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD) in their annual reporting. Elsewhere, we saw finalization of the\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the CSRD) in the European Union, and issuance of the International\nSustainability Standards Board’s (the ISSB) inaugural standards. These efforts are expected to contribute to greater\nharmonization of sustainability reporting standards globally, thereby helping to mitigate greenwashing concerns\nand improve the quality of sustainability data.\nAlongside a continued focus on climate matters in corporate disclosures and regulatory frameworks, there is an\nincreasing recognition of the degree to which the world’s biodiversity and natural capital are being damaged. This\nis a growing concern, as many business sectors rely on natural resources to operate effectively and efficiently;\neroding those resources could have profound implications, both for the global economy and wider society. New\nframeworks have been rolled out to enhance transparency in this area, notably by the Taskforce on Nature-related\nFinancial Disclosures (the TNFD) in September 2023. The publication of the TNFD guidelines and their adoption may\nwell lead regulators to ask businesses to take into consideration more effectively the impact of their activities on\nnature. We expect that, over time, this will also drive further client interest in natural capital and biodiversity topics\nand corresponding products and solutions.\nFinally, after two years of formulating and refining net-zero commitments, 2023 saw a strong focus on\nimplementation. With ongoing progress in methodologies, data and transition finance frameworks, the emphasis\nof industry discussions is shifting toward the quality and ambition level of net-zero targets. For many of our clients\nmeanwhile, developing the right transition strategies, given the fast pace of technological innovation, along with\nhigh inflation and input costs, is a key consideration. Voluntary carbon markets will likely play an important part in\nthe world’s transition to low-carbon economies, but they continued to suffer from relatively depressed prices in\n2023. Nonetheless, market and policy standards aiming to safeguard against known market weaknesses continued\nto evolve.\n› Refer to ubs.com/code for the full UBS Code of Conduct and Ethics\n› Refer to “Our strategy, business model and environment” in the UBS Group Annual Report 2023\nSustainability Report 2023 | Introduction 1133\nStrategy\nOur sustainability and impact strategy\nWhat sustainability means to us\nWe all have a role to play in securing a more sustainable world, and the financial industry is no exception. At UBS,\nwe reimagine the power of people and capital to create a better world for everyone, striving toward a fairer society,\na more prosperous economy and a healthier environment. That is why we partner with our clients to help them\nmobilize their capital toward a more sustainable world and it is why we have made sustainability a significant part\nof our culture.\nGroup-wide application of sustainability and impact strategy\nThe sustainability and impact strategy of Pre-acquisition UBS now applies to UBS Group. Credit Suisse AG does not\nmaintain a separate sustainability strategy, but its activities are integrated within the strategy of UBS Group. While\ncertain sustainability-related policies, processes and activities continued at Credit Suisse AG, they are applied within\nthe overarching strategy of UBS Group which is focused on three key priorities to achieve it: Planet, People and\nPartnerships.\n› Refer to “UBS Sustainability objectives and achievements 2023 and objectives 2024 ” section in the Supplement to\nthe UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for more information\nabout our sustainability and impact key mid- and long-term aspirations.\nSupporting our clients’ low-carbon transition\nHelping our clients to navigate the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy and build climate-resilient business\nmodels is a key objective of our approach to climate, as is the mobilization of private and institutional capital toward\nthis transition. Aligning our in-scope lending and investment portfolios to the objectives of the Paris Agreement is\nan important part of this approach and so are the products and services we offer.\nPlanet first\nWe acknowledge that achieving the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy is highly ambitious. Nonetheless,\nwe are committed to doing our part, which is why the shift to a lower-carbon future is a priority for UBS and a key\nfocus of our sustainability strategy.\nIn order to protect our clients’ assets and those of our firm from the impacts of climate change and loss of\nbiodiversity, we are focused on managing the risks related to climate and natural capital. However, at the same\ntime, we recognize that the low-carbon transition also presents consequential opportunities.\n› Refer to the “Environment” section of this report for more information about our approach to climate\n› Refer to the UBS Group Climate and Nature Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting which brings\ntogether all climate- and nature-related information in this report\nPeople matter\nAs a large, diverse and inclusive organization with a global presence, we want to use our influence to help people\nadvance. We do this through our interactions with each other, the communities in which we operate and our other\nstakeholders. We also believe this approach can support the creation of a diverse, equitable and inclusive society\nand help build a virtuous cycle of viable, long-term economic and social development.\n› Refer to the “Social” section of this report for more information about UBS’s employees and its philanthropic\nactivities\nPartnerships bring it together\nThe sustainability-related challenges our world faces cannot be solved by one organization alone. That is why we\npartner with other thought leaders and standard setters to unite around common goals that can drive change on\na global scale.\n› Refer to the Supplement to this report available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for more about our\npartnerships and our stakeholder engagement\nSustainability Report 2023 | Strategy 1144\nOur aspirations and progress\nWe work with a long-term focus on providing appropriate returns to our stakeholders in a responsible manner. We\nare committed to providing transparent aspirations or targets and reporting on the progress made against them.\nFollowing the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, our exposure increased accordingly, so we reviewed our\naspirations.

We will continue to adjust our\napproach in line with external developments and evolving best practices for the financial sector and climate science. Refer to the Supplement to the UBS Group\nSustainability Report 2023 for parts of the value chain within sectors covered by metrics and targets. Metrics are based on gross exposure, which includes total\nloans and advances to customers, fair value loans and guarantees as well as irrevocable loan commitments. Exclusions from the scope of analysis primarily\ninclude financial services, credit card and other exposure to private individuals. 3 As part of our ship finance strategy, ships in scope of Poseidon Principles\n(PP) are assessed on criteria which aim at aligning portfolios to the PP decarbonization trajectories. The PP are a framework for assessing and disclosing, on an\nannual basis, the climate alignment of in-scope ship finance portfolios to the ambition of the International Maritime Organization (the IMO), including its 2023\nRevised GHG Strategy for GHG emissions from international shipping to decrease to net zero by or around 2050 (compared with 2008 levels). 4 Refer to the\n“Environment” section of this report for further information. The inherent one-year time lag between the as-of date of our lending exposure and the as-of\ndate of emissions can be explained by two factors: corporations disclose their emissions in annual reporting only a few months after the end of a financial year;\nand specialized third-party data providers take up to nine months to collect disclosed data and make it available to data users. Consequently, the baselines for\nour decarbonization targets are calculated on year-end 2021 lending exposure and 2020 emissions data. Our 2022 emissions actuals are based on year-end\n2022 lending exposure and 2021 emissions data. For asset financing (e.g., real estate, shipping) there is no time lag, and exposure and emissions actuals refer\nto the same year. 5 The 20% alignment goal amounted to USD 235 billion at the time of Pre-acquisition Asset Management’s commitment in 2021. By 2030,\nthe weighted average carbon intensity of funds is to be 50% below the carbon intensity of the respective 2019 benchmark. 6 Scope 2 emissions are market-\nbased emissions. The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5–10% residuals required for net zero (per the definition of a\n“net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our ambition for 2050. In 2024, we will be reviewing\nour 2025 scope 1 and 2 target for achievability for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. 7 In 2024, we may review our targets for\nGHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those vendors that collectively account for\nmore than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions. 8 Figures provided for the UBS Optimus network of foundations are based on unaudited management\naccounts and information available as of January 2024. Audited financial statements for UBS Optimus network of foundations entities are produced and\navailable per local market regulatory guideline.\nCautionary note: We have developed methodologies that we use to set our climate-related targets and identify climate-related risks and which underly the\nmetrics that are disclosed in this report. Standard-setting organizations and regulators continue to provide new or revised guidance and standards, as well as\nnew or enhanced regulatory requirements for climate disclosures. Our disclosed metrics are based upon data available to us, including estimates and\napproximations where actual or specific data is not available. We intend to update our disclosures to comply with new guidance and regulatory requirements as\nthey become applicable to UBS. Such updates may result in revisions to our disclosed metrics, our methodologies and related disclosures, which may be substantial,\nas well as changes to the metrics we disclose.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Strategy 1166\nGovernance\nOur sustainability governance\nOur sustainability and corporate culture activities are grounded in our Principles and Behaviors and overseen at the\nhighest level of our organization.

The BoD oversees the overall direction, supervision and\ncontrol of the Group and its management. It also supervises compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Chairman of the BoD, together with the Group CEO, takes responsibility for UBS’s reputation and is closely\ninvolved in, and responsible for, ensuring effective communication with shareholders and stakeholders, including\ngovernment officials, regulators and public organizations.\nFive committees support the BoD in fulfilling its duty through the respective responsibilities and authority given to\nthem. All BoD committees have specific responsibilities pertaining to ESG matters. For example, the Compensation\nCommittee is responsible for ESG-related compensation topics, the Risk Committee supervises the integration of\nESG in risk management, the Governance and Nominating Committee supports the Board in establishing best\npractices in corporate governance and the Audit Committee has oversight of the control framework underpinning\nESG metrics.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Governance 1177\nThe BoD’s Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) is the body primarily\nresponsible for corporate culture, responsibility, and sustainability.\nThe CCRC oversees our Group-wide sustainability and impact strategy and key activities across environmental and\nsocial topics. This includes climate, nature, and human rights. Annually, it considers and approves our firm’s\nsustainability (including climate) and impact objectives. As part of this process, it also considers the impact and\nfinancial materiality of climate-related risks and opportunities on UBS’s business and strategy.\nThe CCRC’s function is forward-looking in that it monitors and reviews societal trends and transformational\ndevelopments and assesses their potential relevance for the Group. In undertaking this assessment, it reviews\nstakeholder concerns and expectations pertaining to the societal performance of UBS and to the development of\nits corporate culture. UBS has various mechanisms (including complaint and feedback procedures) in place to ensure\nthat such concerns and expectations are received, managed and, where necessary, brought to the attention of the\nGroup Executive Board (the GEB) and the BoD. The CCRC is also responsible for conducting the annual review\nprocess for the Code and for proposing amendments to the BoD. This process includes a prior review of the Code\nby the GEB and is led by the Group CEO.\n› Refer to ubs.com/code for the full UBS Code of Conduct and Ethics\nThe GEB develops the Group strategy and is responsible for managing our assets and\nliabilities in line with that strategy and our regulatory commitments, and in the interests of\nour stakeholders.\nAs determined by the BoD’s Risk Committee, the GEB manages the risk profile of the Group as a whole and has\noverall responsibility for establishing and implementing risk management and control.

Until its acquisition by UBS Group\nin June 2023, Credit Suisse Group AG had an established sustainability governance system. It was exercised at its\nBoard of Directors, Executive Board, and senior management levels, thus integrating sustainability into line\nprocesses and structures, as well as through boards and committees specifically focused on sustainability topics.\nWith the integration of Credit Suisse into UBS Group in 2023, this governance was adapted for Credit Suisse and\nintegrated into UBS Group, which included the successive retirement of certain CS governance bodies.\nIn 2023, alignment with the Group’s strategies, objectives and guidelines has been ensured through representation\nof UBS personnel in the governance bodies of Credit Suisse. The governance of sustainability at Credit Suisse AG is\nexercised through its established governance bodies, thus integrating sustainability into operational processes and\nstructures, as well as through those boards and committees specifically focused on sustainability topics. Certain\nCredit Suisse sustainability governance bodies have already been retired in 2023 and it is our aim to achieve full\nintegration of the relevant bodies, together with their associated procedures and policies, into the overall UBS\nGroup sustainability governance during 2024.\n› Refer to “Appendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit Suisse AG” in the appendices to this report for an\nexplanation and depiction of the sustainability governance (including the main bodies involved) at Credit Suisse AG\nSustainability Report 2023 | Governance 1188\nGroup Sustainability and Impact\nGSI (Group Sustainability and Impact) comprises the Chief Sustainability Office and the Social Impact Office, headed\nby the CSO and the Head of Social Impact respectively.\nThe CSO is responsible for driving implementation of the following: the Group-wide sustainability and impact\nstrategy, the approach to climate across all in-scope activities, and the ESG data strategy. In addition, the CSO has\nresponsibility for supporting the business divisions and Group Functions in the design of sustainability frameworks,\nthe implementation of sustainability regulations and the development of education and awareness programs in\nrelation to sustainability. Furthermore, the CSO also manages external relationships, industry advocacy and the\nannual sustainability disclosure.\nThe Head of Social Impact is responsible for driving and implementing the Social Impact strategy, including\nCommunity Impact, Philanthropy Services and UBS Global Visionaries. Reporting to the Head of Social Impact, the\nregional Heads of Social Impact and Philanthropy are responsible for extending the reach and maximizing the\neffectiveness of our social impact activities locally, nationally and globally. In addition, they have responsibility for\nall our programs’ operations and risk management, client engagement, and employee volunteering.\nProgress made in implementing Group-wide sustainability and impact objectives is reported as part of UBS’s annual\nsustainability disclosure. This reporting is reviewed and assured externally according to the requirements of the\nSustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (the GRI Standards). UBS Group excluding\nCredit Suisse is also certified under the ISO 14001 standard for its products, services and activities in all business\ndivisions and locations. To this degree, UBS seeks to continuously improve environmental and sustainability\nperformance, as well as pollution prevention, where possible, across UBS.

Reporting to the Group Chief Financial Officer (the GCFO) and the GEB\nLead for Sustainability and Impact, the sCFO also works closely with the Group Controller and the Chief Accounting\nOfficer’s team and is the primary lead on sustainability topics for the GCFO. The sCFO ensures that sustainability\nconsiderations are embedded into our financial decision-making processes and supports the expanding external\nsustainability disclosures arising from both new regulatory requirements and the voluntary commitments made by\nour firm. In addition, the sCFO ensures the continued development of the financial control environment that\nunderpins our disclosures.\nSustainability and Climate Task Force\nThe SCTF is the cross-divisional and cross-functional authority for sustainability and climate governance, as well as\nthe Group’s sustainability and climate governance body. Its role includes agreeing on the actions required to achieve\nUBS’s sustainability and impact strategy, monitoring progress against that strategy and providing assurances to the\nGEB that UBS is managing sustainability and climate risks and opportunities in an appropriate manner.\nThe SCTF relies on the Sustainability and Climate Implementation Group to ensure cross-divisional, cross-functional\nand cross-regional (if needed) alignment of sustainability and climate activities. It oversees the following cross-\ndivisional and cross-functional workstreams: Net Zero, Corporate Disclosures and Reporting, Regulatory and\nMarket, Financial Risk Management, Non-Financial Risk, Investment Product Regulations, Commercial\nOpportunities, Data and Methodology, and Educate workstreams.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Governance 1199\nKey topics and working groups\nNet-zero workstream\nOur approach to climate outlines our ambition to support clients through the world’s transition to a low-carbon\neconomy and embed considerations of climate change risks and opportunities across the bank for the benefit of\nour stakeholders. As part of this, it is our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our\nscope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities by 2050. The net-zero workstream coordinates the implementation\nand execution of this ambition, in line with UBS’s fiduciary responsibilities. It is one of the workstreams reporting\ninto the SCTF and includes members from the business divisions and Group Functions.\nOwn operations: in-house environmental management\nOur in-house environmental management is steered by Group Corporate Services (GCS). Reporting to the Group\nHead Human Resources and Corporate Services, GCS is responsible for driving the reduction in the environmental\nimpact arising from our offices, technology and supply chain. GCS implements the sustainability and impact strategy\nwithin UBS’s operations by ensuring compliance with local legislation, monitoring and measuring environmental\nand energy performance, and making continuous improvements in accordance with ISO 14001, the international\nenvironmental management standard, and ISO 50001 (EMEA region).\nNature\nOur approach to nature and the environment is part of the group-wide sustainability and impact strategy overseen\nby the CCRC. The GEB is responsible for driving our nature-related efforts, as part of the measures to achieve our\nsustainability and impact strategy. The business divisions and Group Functions ensure that UBS’s nature-related\nstrategy and risk management frameworks are implemented. Through strategy management reports, GSI\nperiodically updates the GEB and CCRC on our approach to nature. On an annual basis, the CCRC receives\ndedicated updates on nature and biodiversity, including the progress of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures (the TNFD) and UBS’s own activities relating to the TNFD, as well as updates on the evolving frameworks\nand regulations, and potential nature-related risks and opportunities facing the firm.\n› Refer to the “Appendix 2 – Environment” in the appendices to this report for more information on our approach to\nnature\nHuman rights\nAs our Human Rights Statement articulates, the governance outlined above also applies to our commitment to\nrespecting internationally recognized human rights across UBS globally.\n› Refer to ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for our Human Rights Statement\nFinancial crime prevention\nThe GEB oversees our efforts to combat money laundering, corruption and terrorist financing.

Based on\nthis review, we have undertaken revisions to the decarbonization targets and also explicitly described in-scope\nactivities where we have detailed plans, supported by short- and medium-term targets.\nBy 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and\nspecified scope 3 activities. Our current targets include:\nScope 1 and 2:\n– minimizing our scope 1 and 2 emissions through energy efficiencies and by switching to more sustainable energy\nsources; after which, procuring credible carbon removal credits to neutralize any residual emissions down to zero\nby 20251;\nScope 3:\n– engaging with our GHG key vendors, for 100% of them to declare their emissions and set net zero-aligned goals\nby 2026, and reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with net-zero trajectories by 20352;\n– addressing our financed emissions by aligning specified sectors to decarbonization pathways; and\n– aiming, by 2030, to align 20% of UBS AG Asset Management’s total assets under management (AuM) with net\nzero.3\nWe recognize that there is more to do, and we aim to phase in additional scope 3 activities over time. While we\ncontinue to take steps to align our business activities with the ambition set out above, it is important to note that\nprogress towards our targets may not be linear. Our priority is to support the transition of clients to a low-carbon\neconomy, and their transition-financing needs. In the area of client investments, the scope of our investments that\nare subject to net-zero targets and our ability to meet our ambitions depend on our fiduciary duties as an investment\nmanager and on the terms of the mandates agreed to with clients.\nReaching net zero will require collaboration across the private and public sectors. Decarbonization of the global\neconomy, emissions reductions by clients, and the realization of our own targets and ambitions all depend on\nvarious factors outside of our direct influence. Clear guidance by governments through thoughtful regulations,\npolicies and incentives, the development and scaling of key technologies, and broader changes in the behavior of\nour society are needed.\nWe actively participate in political discussions to share our expertise on proposed regulatory and supervisory changes\nand engage in discussions relating to sustainability and climate (e.g., via the International Institute of Finance (the\nIIF), the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (the AFME) and the Swiss Bankers Association (the SBA)). In\naddition, our participation in sustainability- and climate-focused organizations and associations helps us to deliver\non our commitments whilst promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nWe will continue to adjust our approach in line with external developments and evolving best practices for the\nfinancial sector and climate science. This may also lead us to revisit previously agreed voluntary commitments.\n1 Scope 2 emissions are market-based emissions. The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5-10% residuals required for net\nzero (per the definition of a “net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our ambition for 2050. In\n2024, we will be reviewing our 2025 scope 1 and 2 target for achievability for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance.\n2 In 2024, we may review our targets for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those\nvendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions.\n3 This Pre-acquisition UBS aspiration will be reassessed in 2024.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 2211\nOwn operations\nIn 2023, we reduced our scope 1 and market-based scope 2 emissions by 21% and, for UBS Group excluding Credit\nSuisse, we continued to apply an internal carbon price of USD 400 per metric ton for scope 1 and 2 emissions in\nour capital investment business cases to support the transition away from carbon-intense building systems. In\naddition, we were able to achieve 96% renewable electricity in line with the stringent RE1004 guidelines.\n› Refer to “Use of carbon offsets and carbon removal credits” in the “Environment” section of this report for more\ninformation about our internal carbon price\nWith regards to our supply chain, we have continued a process of engagement with our vendors, asking them to\nprovide their climate disclosures and set net zero-aligned goals. The number of our vendors completing their climate\ndisclosures in CDP increased by 74% from 2022 to 2023. Meanwhile, 65% of our GHG key vendors (which we\ndefine as those vendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions) have\ndeclared their emissions in CDP and set net zero-aligned goals.\nFinancing activities\nWe evaluated the combined lending portfolios and resulting exposures to carbon-intensive sectors following the\nacquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in June 2023 and have set revised decarbonization targets for the Group.\nWe have updated our previous emissions targets for real estate mortgage lending, as well as for the fossil fuels (oil,\ngas and coal), power generation and cement sectors, reflecting both the combined portfolios of the two firms and\nthe methodology changes. We also identified iron and steel and shipping as additional target sectors. For the Credit\nSuisse AG in-scope shipping portfolio, we continue to disclose the portfolio’s climate alignment to the Poseidon\nPrinciples decarbonization index. In addition, we undertook further assessment of the overall emissions associated\nwith our lending and real estate mortgages and conducted a preliminary analysis of the facilitated emissions from\nour capital markets activities for select carbon-intensive sectors.\nInvesting activities\nUBS AG Asset Management made progress during 2023 toward delivering its 2030 target of aiming to align 20%\nof UBS AG Asset Management’s total assets under management (AuM) with net zero, using science-based portfolio\nalignment approaches. This included implementing revisions to fund documentation and investment management\nagreements in certain portfolios to align with our net-zero-aligned framework. This Pre-acquisition UBS aspiration\nwill be reassessed in 2024.\nOur Global Wealth Management business division is a large distributor and manager of investment solutions for\nclients, including sustainable investing solutions and climate-focused investments. We supported private investors\nand family offices seeking to decarbonize their overall holdings by offering related investment solutions across asset\nclasses and increasing climate awareness through dedicated client education sessions.\nSupporting climate-focused frameworks\nWe are committed to helping our clients achieve their decarbonization goals and to supporting the work of\ngovernments around the world in their transition to a low-carbon economy in alignment with the objectives of the\nParis Agreement.

The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5-10% residuals required for net zero (per\nthe defi nition of a “net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our ambition for 2050. In 2024, we will be\nreviewing our 2025 scope 1 and 2 target for achievability for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. 2 Target applies to UBS Group excluding\nCredit Suisse. 3 While we continue to take steps to align our business activities to our targets, it is important to note that progress towards our targets may not be\nlinear and that the realization of our own targets and ambitions is dependent on various factors which are outside of our direct infl uence. We will continue to adjust our\napproach in line with external developments, as well as evolving best practices for the fi nancial sector and climate science. Refer to the “Climate-related methodologies\n– net-zero approach for our fi nancing activities“ section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting,\nfor more information about parts of the value chain within sectors covered by metrics and targets. Metrics are based on gross exposure, which includes total loans and\nadvances to customers, fair value loans and guarantees as well as irrevocable loan commitments. Exclusions from scope of analysis primarily comprise fi nancial services\nfi rms and other exposure to private individuals. 4 As part of our ship fi nance strategy, ships in scope of Poseidon Principles are assessed on criteria which aim at\naligning portfolios to the Poseidon Principles decarbonization trajectories. The PP are a framework for assessing and disclosing, on an annual basis, the climate\nalignment of in-scope ship fi nance portfolios to the ambition of the International Maritime Organization (the IMO), including its 2023 Revised GHG Strategy\nfor GHG emissions from international shipping to decrease to net zero by or around 2050 (against 2008 levels). 5 This Pre-acquisition UBS aspiration will be\nreassessed in 2024. In line with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, we acknowledge that the scope for asset managers to invest for net zero depends on the\nmandates agreed with clients and clients’ and managers’ regulatory environments. Also in the expectation that governments will follow through on their own\ncommitments to ensure the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met, including increasing the ambition of their Nationally Determined Contributions, and in\nthe context of investing, our legal duties to clients and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. In some asset classes or for some investment strategies,\nagreed net-zero methodologies do not yet exist. Where our ability to align our approach to investments with the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 is, today,\nconstrained, we commit to embark with determination and ambition on a journey, and to challenge and seek to overcome the constraints we face. 6 In 2024,\nwe may review our target for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those vendors\nthat collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 2233\nOur climate-related metrics\nEvolving our climate-related metrics\nStandard-setting organizations and regulators continue to provide new or revised guidance and standards, as well as\nnew or enhanced regulatory requirements for climate disclosures. We have developed methodologies that we use to\nset our climate-related targets and identify climate-related risks and opportunities. These methodologies underlie the\nmetrics that are disclosed in this report and are based upon data available to us, including estimates and approximations\nwhere actual or specific data is not available. We intend to update our disclosures to comply with new guidance and\nregulatory requirements as they become applicable to UBS. Such updates may result in possibly substantial revisions to\nour disclosed metrics methodologies and related disclosures. They may also change the metrics we disclose.\nOur climate-related targets have been set based on the methodologies, data and assumptions currently in use.\nChanges to these methodologies, data and assumptions may affect our progress toward these targets and our net-\nzero ambition, as well as their achievability. Our net-zero ambition and related targets for scope 3 emissions have\na critical dependency on the overall progress made by all sectors and countries toward net-zero carbon emissions.\nAcross many jurisdictions, substantial governmental action will be required to achieve that progress. If such\nadvances are not made, our targets and ambitions with respect to scope 3 emissions will not be achievable.\nClimate-related risks and opportunities metrics 2023\nClimate-related risks and opportunities metrics\n% change\nFor the year ended\nfrom\n31.12.23 31.12.22 31.12.21 31.12.22\nRisks (UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse)\nCarbon-related assets (USD billion)1, 2, 3, 4, 5 34.2 33.6 36.0 1.7\nExposure to climate-sensitive sectors, transition risk (USD billion)1, 2, 4, 5, 6 58.1 52.5 52.4 10.6\nExposure to climate-sensitive sectors, physical risk (USD billion)1, 2, 4, 5, 6 46.2 38.0 36.7 21.4\nExposure to nature-related risks (USD billion)1, 4, 5, 6, 7 72.0 64.6 67.3 11.4\nOpportunities (UBS Group)\nNumber of green, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bond deals8 93 69 98 34.8\nTotal deal value of green, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bond deals (USD billion)8 49.3 42.4 63.3 16.3\nUBS-apportioned deal value of above (USD billion) 11.6 8.8 13.2 31.6\n1 Methodologies for assessing climate- and nature-related risks are emerging and may change over time. As the methodologies, tools, and data availability improve, we will further\ndevelop our risk identification and measurement approaches. Lombard lending rating is assigned based on the average riskiness of loans. 2 Metrics are calculated and restated based\non the 2023 methodology, across three years of reporting, 2021–2023. 3 As defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD), in its expanded definition\npublished in 2021, UBS defines carbon-related assets through industry-identifying attributes of the firm’s banking book. UBS further includes the four non-financial sectors addressed\nby the TCFD, including, but not limited to, fossil fuel extraction, carbon-based power generation, transportation (air, sea, rail, and auto manufacture), metals production and mining,\nmanufacturing industries, real estate development, chemicals, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, building and construction materials and activities, forestry, agriculture, fishing,\nfood and beverage production, as well as including trading companies that may trade any of the above (e.g., oil trading or agricultural commodity trading companies). This metric is\nagnostic of risk rating, and therefore may include exposures of companies that may be already transitioning or adapting their business models to climate risks, unlike UBS climate-\nsensitive sectors methodology, which takes a risk-based approach to defining material exposure to climate impacts. 4 Total customer lending exposure consists of total loans and\nadvances to customers and guarantees, as well as irrevocable loan commitments (within the scope of expected credit loss) and is based on consolidated and standalone IFRS numbers.\nThe credit exposure includes portfolio adjustment bookings, which are either directly impacting the metrics, and have been reflected in the heatmaps, or are impact assessed and\nimmaterial to the metrics representation. 5 UBS continues to collaborate to resolve methodological and data challenges, and seeks to integrate both impacts to and dependency on\na changing natural and climatic environment, in how it evaluates risks and opportunities. 6 Climate- and nature-related risks are scored between 0 and 1, based on sustainability\nand climate risk transmission channels, as outlined in the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023. Risk ratings represent a range of scores across five-rating categories:\nlow, moderately low, moderate, moderately high, and high. The climate- or nature-sensitive exposure metrics are determined based upon the top three of the five rated categories:\nmoderate to high. 7 Nature-related risk metric methodology has been further strategically enhanced, as part of an ongoing collaboration between UBS and UNEP-FI. 8 The metrics\ninclude transactions such as, but not limited to, Investment Bank Global Banking bonds issued under the voluntary ICMA Green Bond Principles, Sustainability Bond Principles, and\nSustainability-Linked Bond Principles. The principles include a recommendation that the issuer appoints an external review provider to undertake an independent external review (e.g.,\nsecond-party opinion). This is consistent with market practice. The metrics also include sustainability themed bonds (e.g., Transition). Transactions are counted only once, there is no\ndouble counting (e.g., if and where UBS AG and Credit Suisse were involved in the same transaction). UBS performed an assessment for Credit Suisse green, social, sustainability and\nsustainability-linked bonds reported in the 2023 Sustainability Report and deemed them to be aligned to UBS sustainable bond guidelines.\n› Refer to the “Supporting our approach to climate – our climate-related materiality assessment” section of the\nSupplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more\ninformation about our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities\n› Refer to the “Managing sustainability and climate risks” section of this report for more details on climate-related\nrisk metrics\nClimate-related lending metrics 2023\nBased on the guidelines by the World Resources Institute (the WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment (the WBCSD) for reporting in the event of a material acquisition5, the emissions metrics shown for 31\nDecember 2021 and 31 December 2022 are calculated on the basis of the joint loan books of UBS and Credit Suisse\non those dates, on a pro forma basis.

Refer to the “Environment” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for a breakdown of our GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\nOur approach to nature\nWe recognize the challenges of transitioning toward a society that can meet human needs while respecting the\nlimits of our planet’s natural resources. These challenges are reflected in stark numbers: for example, the World\nEconomic Forum estimates that approximately USD 58 trillion of economic value depends on the natural world in\nsome way, yet, according to a recent United Nations Environment Programme report, annual financial flows to\nnature-based solutions need to more than double by 2025 (from USD 200 billion to USD 436 billion) and nearly\ntriple to USD 542 billion by 2030 to reach climate, biodiversity and land degradation targets6. However, challenges\ncan represent opportunities. That is why we look forward to the setting of global policy objectives and goals through\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity and welcome the milestone set of policy goals adopted by governments in\nthe shape of the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a key enabler for setting critical direction\nfor economy-wide transitions aimed at safeguarding global biodiversity. We firmly believe that public policy and\nframeworks have, and will continue, to play a critical role in steering and incentivizing markets to support the\ntransition toward a sustainable economy.\nOur approach to understanding impacts and dependencies related to natural capital and biodiversity, and managing\nthe resulting risks and opportunities across our activities, reflects our commitment to mobilize capital toward\nachieving the SDGs. Nonetheless, we are aware that natural capital is inherently more challenging to define in\nfinancial terms due to a lack of easily available data and standardized methodologies. Therefore, we strive to play\nan active role in creating new global standards that can help clients, companies and the financial sector manage\nnature-related risks and develop opportunities, while also addressing potential adverse impacts and generating\npositive impacts. That is why we were honored to be part of the efforts of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures (the TNFD), including leading its financial sector working group, and contributing to the development\nof the recommendations it released in September 2023.\nBuilding on our first integrated UBS Group Climate and Nature Report for 2022, we developed our activities and\ndisclosures for 2023 by leveraging the recommendations set by the TNFD. We will continue to develop our\ndisclosures on nature dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities over the next few years, aligned with the TNFD\nrecommendations and regulatory requirements.\nDuring the course of 2023, we also contributed to the debate and improvement of knowledge and innovation in\nthis area through our thought leadership activities and capacity building exercises. For instance, we ran a Nature\nAcademy to train key staff about nature-related issues, frameworks, standards, risks and opportunities.\n› Refer to the “Managing sustainability and climate risks” section of this report and the “Our approach to nature”\nsection in “Appendix 2 – Environment” in the appendices to this report for more information about our\nmanagement of nature-related risks and opportunities\n› Refer to our UBS Group Climate and Nature Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting\n6 Source : UN Environment Programme, State of Finance for Nature 2023\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 2266\nSupporting our clients’ low-carbon transition\nHelping our clients to navigate the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy and build climate-resilient business\nmodels is a key objective of our approach to climate, as is the mobilization of private and institutional capital toward\nthis transition.

As the automotive and aluminum sectors\npreviously reported by the Credit Suisse Group did not meet the exposure or emissions materiality thresholds as\ncalculated based on estimated 2023 exposure for the combined portfolios, they have been deprioritized for target\nsetting at this time.\nWe will continue to assess the materiality of the deprioritized sectors annually and aim to develop additional targets\nfor the remaining material carbon-intensive sectors in line with our commitment to the NZBA and as data and\nmethodologies become available.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 2288\nOverview of lending sector decarbonization targets and progress¹\nSwiss residential real estate² Swiss commercial real estate² Fossil fuels\nkg COe / m2 ERA³ kg COe / m2 ERA³ million metric t COe\n2 2 2\n40 38.7 40 31.3 70 64.7\n36.5 32.1\n21.1\n16.2 45.9\n19.4\n0 0.3 0 0.5 0 0\n2021 2030 2050 2021 2030 2050 2021 2030 2050\nUBS actuals UBS target UBS actuals UBS target UBS actuals UBS target\n2050 convergence point 2050 convergence point 2050 convergence point\nImplied Energy Perspectives 2050+ Implied Energy Perspectives 2050+ ZERO Indicative trend line to 2030 target\nZERO Basis – residential buildings Basis – residential buildings & services\nIndicative trend line to 2030 target Indicative trend line to 2030 target\nPower generation Iron and steel Cement\nkg COe / MWh metric t CO / metric t steel metric t CO / metric t cementitious\n2 2 2\n490 2 0.70\n1.75 0.64 0.63\n339\n1.28 0.48\n1.68\n297\n136\n0 –4 0 0.12 0 0.02\n2021 2030 2050 2021 2030 2050 2021 2030 2050\nUBS actuals UBS target UBS actuals UBS target UBS actuals UBS target\n2050 convergence point 2050 convergence point 2050 convergence point\nIEA NZE 2050 IEA NZE 2050 (adjusted) IEA NZE 2050 (adjusted)\nIndicative trend line to 2030 target Indicative trend line to 2030 target Indicative trend line to 2030 target\nShipping4\nalignment delta %\n60\n–60\n2016 2050 2010 2050\nPortfolio climate alignment score 2022 vs Striving for 2022 vs Minimum\nIndex trajectory Poseidon Principles Striving Minimum\n1 For corporate sectors (fossil fuels, power generation, iron and steel, and cement) we have used the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA). The SDA\nassumes global convergence of key sectors’ emissions intensities by 2050 and we set our 2030 targets to be in line with this assumption. We have used\nexternally published independent net-zero scenarios as reference for the 2050 convergence points used to defi ne the 2030 targets. 2 Swiss commercial\nreal estate and Swiss residential real estate portfolio decarbonization rates are in line with the Implied Energy Perspectives 2050+ ZERO Basis benchmarks.\nThe high observed emissions intensities are mainly due to conservative assumptions (e.g., oil heating assumed if actual heating type not available) and high\nemissions factors per unit of energy used. The portfolio increase for Swiss commercial real estate was primarily driven by a change of the portfolio mix of\nproperties fi nanced by Credit Suisse Group, with an increased weight of properties with higher emissions characteristics. 3 ERA: Energy Reference Area\n4 Shipping graphs display our portfolio’s alignment to the Poseidon Principles decarbonization trajectories.\n› Refer to the “Supplement to Environment” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about our targets\n› Refer to the “Basis of Reporting” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available\nat ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for more information about our climate-related lending metrics\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 29\n%\natled\ntnemngilA\n100\n50% tank-to-wake CO reduction\n2\ntrajectory by 2050\n–2.4% (2020 IMO DCS)\n–1.3% (2021 IMO DCS)\n–4.6% (2022 IMO DCS)\n–100\n%\natled\ntnemngilA\nFOR SR REPORT\n–45% –48% –70%\n–60% –27% –24%\n2018 IMO GHG Strategy 2023 IMO GHG Strategy\n(”IMO Initial GHG Strategy”) (”IMO Revised GHG Strategy”)\nNet-zero well-to-wake COe\n2\nreduction trajectories by 2050\n+15.7% (2022 IMO \"Striving for\"\nalignment score)\n+11.5% (2022 IMO \"Minimum\"\nalignment score)\n29\nOur approach to target-setting is based on the guidance from global standards and initiatives such as the NZBA,\nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment\n(PACTA) and the Science-Based Targets Initiative (the SBTi). UBS acknowledges that Credit Suisse had a commitment\nto SBTi to have its 2030 targets externally validated. To develop the combined 2030 targets, we have utilized SBTi\nguidance where possible and we continue to assess the options for target validation and assurance.\nWe strive to measure and monitor progress toward our targets and their alignment with our climate commitments\nand emerging standards. It is important to note that progress towards our targets may not be linear, and year-on-\nyear volatility is expected due to changes in the portfolios’ composition over time. We plan to disclose our progress\npublicly on an annual basis. In line with NZBA guidelines for climate target-setting, we intend, as a minimum, to\nreview our targets every five years to ensure consistency with the most recent climate science and best practices.\nHow we aim to underpin our targets with transition strategies\nTo underpin our targets and guide our transition strategies and actions, we followed a two-step process:\n– assessing the overall emissions associated with UBS’s in-scope lending portfolio, including Swiss real estate\nmortgages and estimated emissions reductions by 2030 (by business division and sector), considering client’s\nhistorical emissions trends as well as public decarbonization commitments; and\n– considering anticipated changes in the size and composition of our in-scope lending portfolios arising from\nlending structures and business strategy.\nAlongside these estimated emissions reductions, we defined three key transition strategy levers where we believe\nwe can have an impact and facilitate additional emissions reductions to reach our targets.\nOur transition strategy levers\nA.Engage: engaging with our clients\nBuilding on the review of our clients’ public decarbonization commitments, we further assess where they currently\nstand on their journey toward a low-carbon and climate-resilient business model. By establishing a view on our\nclients’ current decarbonization ambitions and activities, we aim to work alongside them to support their transition\nefforts. This can include encouraging the disclosure of current emissions, the setting of future decarbonization\ntargets in line with Paris-aligned pathways and the development of credible transition plans.\nThrough our ESG Advisory Group, we are also providing the necessary lens to help our clients assess ESG\n(environmental, social, governance) topics throughout the corporate lifecycle and critically analyze a corporation’s\nESG profile from a business and investor perspective.\n› Refer to the “Investment Bank” section of this report for more information about our ESG Advisory Group\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 30\nsnoissime\nGHG\nIllustrative glidepath to net zero\nStatus quo\nEstimated existing emissions\nreductions\nEngage\nA\n2030 target Engaging with clients\n(absolute / intensity)\nGrow\nB Providing sustainable\nfi nance solutions\nPrioritize\nC Providing capital to lower\ncarbon intensity activities\nIllustrative Carbon removals\n2021 2030 2040 Net zero\nby 2050\n30\nB.Grow: offering sustainable finance solutions\nWe complement our engagement efforts with sustainable and sustainability-linked financial advice and solutions\n(advisory, lending, basic banking and transition financing solutions) to help our clients transition to a more\nsustainable future. These solutions can be on-balance sheet (e.g., green or sustainable loans and mortgages) or off-\nbalance sheet (such as access to debt and equity capital markets). They can also include transaction structuring.\nFor example, in the corporate client business, we focus on supporting our clients by advising them as part of the\nstrategic dialogue and partnering with them in the implementation of new solutions. We offer sustainable-linked\nloans (SLL) to incentivize the borrower’s achievement of ambitious, predetermined sustainability performance\ntargets. Our SLL offering is open to qualifying corporates from all sectors wishing to reflect their sustainability\nambitions in their funding strategy and benefit from meeting agreed sustainability performance targets.\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more information about our sustainable finance\nproduct and service offering, and specifically to the “Personal & Corporate Banking” section for more information\nabout our corporate client business\nWe continue to develop and refine our sustainable finance solutions and approaches on an ongoing basis to support\nour clients in orienting their business efforts toward the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nC.Prioritize: providing capital for lower-carbon-intensity activities\nAs previously highlighted, our aim is to direct capital toward lower-carbon activities, or to clients with credible net-\nzero targets and plans to transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient business models. This is in line with our\nsustainability risk process which may trigger enhanced due diligence for clients in those carbon-intensive sectors\nthat have higher climate-related impacts and risks. At the same time, as the global economy shifts toward lower-\ncarbon activities, we see opportunities to provide financing and advisory services to clients that are well positioned\nto benefit from this transition.\nEvolving our transition strategy\nManaging and monitoring our financing activities remains an ongoing focus. We continue to build on and refine\nour transition strategy and further tailor it to our business divisions. Our aim is to make our approach to climate\n“business as usual” and to orient our new and existing business efforts toward net zero by 2050. We strive to\nroutinely consider the climate impact resulting from our financing activities, take an active approach to growing\nour low-carbon business and address our financed emissions by engaging with clients and supporting their\ntransition. We strive to further strengthen our operating model and increase our efforts in the fields of transition\nand green finance. We also expect new technologies to emerge, along with policies and actions from governments,\nthat will support the transition to a low-carbon economy. We regard such developments as dependencies for us to\ncontribute toward meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nAs we work toward our targets and further develop our transition strategies, we aim to consider a just transition\nto a low-carbon economy, one that is as fair and inclusive as possible. In this regard, we contributed to the market’s\nunderstanding of the concept as part of the Principles for Responsible Banking (the PRB) Just Transition working\ngroup.\nCarbon reduction and removal\nIn accordance with the NZBA guidelines, offsetting can play a role that is supplemental to sectoral and economy-\nwide decarbonization. We support transparent investment in carbon markets that are aligned with the current\npublicly available consensus on high integrity standards and robust governance (including the VCMI (Voluntary\nCarbon Markets Integrity Initiative) Claims Code of Practice, the ICVCM (Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon\nMarket) Core Carbon Principles and the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero-Aligned Carbon Offsetting). Any\ndecarbonization strategies, including offsetting, that UBS applies to its own in-house operations or advises other\norganizations on must meet these standards.\nOur transition plan prioritizes emissions reductions in line with science-based climate targets and credible\ntrajectories to achieve these targets. In addition, we anticipate that the deployment of carbon-removal solutions\nwill be needed to counterbalance hard-to-abate emissions and supplement the reduction strategies of some of our\nclients. For example, certain industrial processes cannot yet achieve absolute zero emissions as technologically or\nfinancially viable emissions-elimination alternatives do not exist. Those industries, however, still provide products\nand services that are important to society and are likely to remain relevant in the future. In these cases, carbon\nremovals are critical to balance residual emissions. As best practice guidance, regulation, methodologies and\ntechnologies develop, our approach to decarbonization, including offsets, will continue to evolve.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3311\nSustainable lending operating model\nTo operationalize our approach to climate, it is important to embed sustainability and climate considerations into\nour lending operating model, leading to regular adjustment of evaluation and decision-making frameworks,\ngovernance structures, control and monitoring processes, and underlying systems.\nFor example, following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, UBS reassessed the emissions and targets for\nsectors with a high-carbon impact for the combined organization. To operationalize our target approach, we are\nreviewing whether our planning and governance processes, risk appetite, sector strategies, and so on are still\nappropriate. In parallel, we are assessing required enhancements to our loan origination, credit granting,\nmonitoring and reporting processes.\nBuilding blocks of the sustainable lending operating model\nLoan Monitoring,\nPlanning and Emissions incl.\norigination and reporting and\ngovernance target setting\ncredit granting data\n– Group oversight – Greenhouse gas – Value proposition – Reporting\n– Risk appetite emissions – Credit decision – UBS data\n– Policies (fi nanced / intensity) – Engagement management\n– Sector strategy – Target metric and – Refi nancing – External vendors\n– Financial management reference pathway – Systems and\n(strategic plan) processes\nOur approach to measuring facilitated emissions from our capital markets business\nInvestment Bank\nThe Investment Bank offers our clients access to the world’s primary, secondary and private capital markets, through\nan array of sustainability- and climate-focused services, products, research and events. Our role in capital market\ntransactions helps our clients access capital for their businesses. We facilitate clients’ capital raising and, therefore,\nthink it is important to monitor the related emissions which we are involved in.\nFacilitated emissions differ from financed emissions in two aspects: Firstly, they are off-balance sheet (representing\nservices rather than financing) and secondly, our role is completed within a short timeframe rather than a long-\nterm loan-related exposure. As a result, and in line with industry guidance, we distinguish between on-balance\nsheet “financed” and off-balance sheet “facilitated” emissions.\nBy disclosing our facilitated emissions for select carbon-intensive sectors1, we aim to provide transparency on the\nemissions we facilitate as a result of our capital market activities. We are currently assessing methodologies for\ncalculating facilitated emissions for the remaining NZBA carbon-intensive sectors2. We calculated UBS’s facilitated\nemissions in line with PCAF’s draft accounting and reporting standard for facilitated emissions, including public\nequity capital markets and public debt capital markets, where UBS, including Credit Suisse, held a lead bookrunner\nor lead manager / co-manager role on the transaction. Facilitated emissions are not shown for the current reporting\nyear due to the inherent time-lag in the availability of emissions data. We have conducted an initial assessment of\nour approach against the final PCAF Standard released in December 2023 and identified select areas to be further\nexplored in 2024.\nIt is important to note that reporting facilitated emissions from transactions that took place in the reporting year\nwill introduce volatility in our numbers as it will be related to the volume of capital markets activity in the year and\nour market share. Global capital markets activity was strong post-Covid in 2020 and 2021 but slower in 2022 and\n2023. When market activity rebounds, we would expect our facilitated emissions to see a similar increase.\n1 Disclosed for those sectors where data and methodology are available: fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), power generation, iron and steel, aluminum, cement,\nautomotive and air transportation.\n2 The NZBA identifies nine priority sectors: agriculture, aluminum, cement, coal, commercial and residential real estate, iron and steel, oil and gas, power\ngeneration and transport.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3322\nUBS reviews and assesses every Global Banking transaction and employs a robust business selection process. This\nmeans that, in our capital markets activities for carbon-intensive sectors, we consider the potential climate and\nsustainability impacts of the transaction and related material risks and opportunities.\nWe continue to review and assess emerging industry guidance and target-setting methodologies for facilitated\nemissions.\n31.12.22 31.12.21\nFacilitated Facilitated Facilitated Facilitated\nFacilitated\nemissions, intensity emissions, intensity\nFacilitated emissions, PCAF Facilitated PCAF\nscopes 1 PCAF (million scopes 1 Facilitated PCAF (million\namount scope 3 score, amount score,\nand 2 score, metric t and 2 emissions, score, metric t\n(USD (million scopes 1 (USD scopes 1\n(million scope 32 COe / (million scope 3 scope 32 COe /\nbillion) metric t and 22 2 billion) and 22 2\nmetric t USD metric t USD\nCOe)\nCOe) 2 billion) COe) billion)\n2 2\nFacilitated\nemissions\nSelect carbon-\n12.0 2.0 2.3 1.6 2.3 0.4 23.0 5.1 16.3 1.6 2.8 0.9\nintensive sectors1\nSelect carbon-\nintensive sectors 5.7% 5.9%\nas % of total\nOther sectors 197.7 368.2\nTotal facilitated\n209.7 391.3\namount3\n1 Select carbon-intensive sectors comprise: fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), power generation, iron and steel, aluminum, cement, automotive and air transportation.

Membership of the NZAM initiative entails\na range of expectations at an organizational level and for in-scope assets under management (AuM). Through this\ncommitment, our aim is to further support our clients in reaching their sustainable investment and decarbonization\nobjectives.\nIn order to provide choice to our clients and to effectively monitor our progress toward our target, we use a clearly\ndefined framework to assess whether a product has a net-zero ambition. This framework is based on the NZAM\ninitiative’s guidance on assets committed to be managed in line with attaining net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier,\nas well as guidance from other industry bodies. From this we have derived the following guiding principles when\ndefining an investment portfolio as having a net-zero ambition:\n– The portfolio has a defined decarbonization target, a commitment to increasing portfolio coverage of SBTi-\nverified targets and/or invests in climate solutions that enable net-zero global GHG emissions by 2050.\n– The portfolio makes a contribution to the transition to a low-carbon economy where relevant companies,\npartners, managers, borrowers, tenants and vendors that are not currently meeting or aligned with net zero are\nthe subject of direct or collective engagement and stewardship actions.\n– Offsets may be used to enable or support long-term carbon removal where there are no technologically and/or\nfinancially viable alternatives to eliminate emissions.\n– Monitoring and annual disclosure of progress toward portfolio-level targets.\n› Refer to the “Supplement to Environment” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for UBS AG Asset Management’s science-based methodologies\n2030 target for the proportion of assets to be managed in line with net zero\nOur Asset Management business division set a target aiming, by 2030, to align 20% of UBS AG Asset\nManagement’s total assets under management (AuM) with net zero.1 Net zero portfolio alignment currently focuses\non areas of its business where methodologies exist and there is credible data to support tracking and reporting of\nour progress, namely active equities, active fixed income, indexed equities and some of our real estate investment\nactivities. We believe, however, that only a proportion of these assets can be feasibly managed in ways that align\nwith net zero by 2030, consistent with their respective intended investment objectives, the needs of our clients,\nand market evolution. There is also a portion of assets for which there is no currently agreed or accepted\nmethodology for net-zero alignment. These include asset classes such as multi-asset funds, hedge funds, private\nmarkets, money markets, sovereign bonds, and municipal issuers. Portfolio alignment will be pursued once\nacceptable data and methodology solutions are identified.\nDuring 2023, we implemented revisions to fund documentation and investment management agreements in\ncertain products to align with our net-zero-aligned framework. UBS AG Asset Management currently has 35\navailable products being managed in line with net zero, representing 2.9% of our total AuM.\nOur plans for making further progress toward our target include investing in the necessary data and infrastructure\nto support the management and monitoring of portfolios, continuing to assess net-zero alignment at the issuer\nlevel, and our active ownership efforts toward the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nWe draw on a wide variety of data sources to inform our assessment of climate-related risk and opportunities and\nrecognize that approaches to achieving net-zero are likely to develop over time as both data availability and quality\ncontinue to improve. Consequently, we also expect our portfolio alignment approach to evolve as the transition to\na low-carbon economy progresses and as further data and methodologies become available. For example, we\nenhanced our assessment by adding temperature alignment and climate solutions approaches, as well as exploring\nhow to best incorporate scope 3 metrics into our data model.\n1 This Pre-acquisition UBS aspiration will be reassessed in 2024.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3344\nHelping clients understand net zero\nWe understand that our approach to net-zero investing is determined by our clients’ choices. We believe that we\nhave an important role to play in working collaboratively with our clients on climate risk education, providing\ninformation about best practices in climate risk management, climate-related opportunities and approaches for net-\nzero-aligned portfolios.\nTo help our clients and other investors understand the journey to net zero, as well as the range of options for\nallocating capital that we offer, we launched a digital campaign during 2023 that provides educational materials\nand thought leadership content. We are using various media avenues available to us to increase awareness,\nincluding a redesigned web experience, videos and podcasts, Adobe campaigns, and our social media platform.\nOur investment experts delivered individualized education to clients and prospects on specific components of\nsustainable investing. Some of our investment approaches include rules-based net-zero strategies, climate-related\nindexing and factor-based investing.\nNet-zero active ownership by UBS AG Asset Management\nWe recognize that the transition of investment portfolios requires real-economy emission reductions and we see\nour active ownership strategy as a powerful tool in influencing corporate behavior to achieve real-economy\noutcomes. We have had a dedicated climate engagement program in place for five years to address climate-related\nrisks with measurable progress tracked. In 2023, we applied a sector-specific approach and engaged with\ncompanies from the following sectors: oil and gas, electricity and other utilities, diversified mining, steel, chemicals,\nand construction material. We set our engagement objectives and expectations based on company target-setting,\ndecarbonization measures, capital deployment and progress toward stated commitments. We also widened our\nengagement coverage to include the highest-emitting companies across our investment universe, expanding the\nrange of sectors and geographies we cover.\nWe have also linked our climate engagement with our voting actions. In this respect, we clarified our climate and\nnet-zero expectations of companies in our policy framework. In 2022, we outlined our criteria for management\nsay-on-climate proposals. In 2023, we have further evaluated such proposals against the following six key factors:\nclimate governance, net-zero ambition and targets, quality of decarbonization strategy, net-zero performance\nalignment, lobbying and policy engagement, and use of offsets.\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more information about our active ownership\napproach and climate engagement program\nCollaborative engagement by UBS AG Asset Management\nUBS AG Asset Management is a co-lead and collaborative investor in Climate Action 100+, engaging with\ncompanies on the initiative’s focus list that are key to driving the global net-zero emissions transition. In 2023, we\njoined, and have been participating in the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC)’s Net Zero\nEngagement Initiative (NZEI), which was set up to build on and extend the reach of investor engagement beyond\nthe Climate Action 100+ focus list. This includes a broader spectrum of companies that are driving demand for\nfossil fuels due to their business activities. In 2023, we were signatories to a CDP campaign encouraging more than\n2,000 companies to adopt science-based climate targets, and co-signatories to two investor-led letters to\npolicymakers encouraging the acceleration of decarbonization goals at state-owned companies.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3355\nAnnual disclosure by UBS AG Asset Management\nUBS completed the annual CDP disclosure in July 2023, including pertinent information about UBS AG Asset\nManagement. Since this disclosure, UBS AG Asset Management has made additional progress against our 2030\ntarget as disclosed above, expanding our available net-zero product shelf and further increasing those AuM that\nare being managed in line with net-zero objectives.\nWe also participated in other industry and disclosure initiatives, and the development of regional best practice\nclimate-related guidance, such as the new Swiss Climate Scores (SCS). UBS was part of the working group\ndeveloping the SCS, an initiative conducted by the Swiss government in collaboration with industry and non-\ngovernmental organizations. The SCS are based on international standards and aim to encourage investment\ndecisions that contribute to achieving the global climate goals. As the largest financial institution in Switzerland,\nwe are committed to this transparency milestone and were the first major bank to launch SCS reports for 136 funds\n(as of 31 December 2023). In accordance with the recommendations put forward by the government, our initial\nfocus is on equities and fixed income funds domiciled in Switzerland. More funds and products will follow in 2024.\nAvailable UBS SCS reports for funds can be viewed on the UBS Quotes data and information platform. For clients\ninterested in climate-related topics, advisors can use the SCS to demonstrate the climate compatibility of products,\nbased on the latest international information available.\n› Refer to sif.admin.ch/swissclimatescores for more information about SCS\n› Refer to UBS quotes for more information about UBS SCS reports for funds\nGlobal Wealth Management\nGlobal Wealth Management is a distributor of sustainable investing solutions, including climate investing. While we\nrecognize that not every investor might have net-zero ambitions or an affinity for investing in the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, we aim to provide a range of options for private investors and family offices to address their\nown decarbonization targets where possible. We do this through allocations to climate-related solutions in our\ndiscretionary mandates where relevant, as well as by curating climate investment options for advisory portfolios.\nThe focus on providing a range of credible solutions is complemented by building investor awareness and driving\nsolutions innovation across asset classes and strategies. We also continue to build an understanding of how best\nto integrate climate risk into portfolios.\nExtending the range of investment options and allocating capital\nIn 2023, Global Wealth Management continued to increase the number of investment solutions across asset classes\nand strategies to support clients’ decarbonization objectives. We launched a low-carbon single equity module and\na sustainability-focused fund of hedge funds solution, which includes allocation to climate-focused equity hedge\nstrategies, credit options for renewable infrastructure and a carbon markets strategy. We also extended our credit\nresearch coverage of individual green bonds, expanding the available universe for clients who prefer direct\ninvestments to fund solutions.\nWe work closely with our industry partners on developing new sustainable solutions, including those aiming to\naddress decarbonization. We aim to identify relevant and compelling investment opportunities and credible tools,\nand to support the launch of new solutions where possible and relevant for client portfolios. We continue to believe\nthat the transition to a low-carbon economy requires an “all-of-the-above” approach where investments in clean\nenergy infrastructure and green technologies are complemented by effective and credible shareholder and\nbondholder engagement with heavy polluters on decarbonization. As such, we dedicate a portion of our\ndiscretionary portfolios to impactful engagement strategies, including those that invest in companies with the\nobjective of engaging on decarbonization.\nHelping clients understand net zero\nOur investment specialists provide education and training to advisors, clients and prospects on various aspects of\nsustainable investing and how to incorporate these strategies into portfolios. These training sessions include general\neducation and discussions around decarbonization and climate investing. We also work with clients that are\ninterested in setting their own portfolio decarbonization targets or are exploring how to build exposure to carbon\nmarkets. In addition to individual client meetings, we host broader client events on specific topics including\ndecarbonization and climate investing. Our conversations emphasize that investing in the transition is relevant not\njust to investors who want to drive positive environmental impact, but rather to all investors, given the importance\nof climate change to business models and capital markets.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3366\nWe also incorporated discussions of the investment relevance of climate and broader sustainability topics in\npublications for private clients throughout 2023. We provided a private investor perspective on emerging\ninvestment opportunities tied to the low-carbon transition, including both regulatory and voluntary carbon markets.\nOur analysts continued to cover a broad range of longer-term investment themes with links to the low-carbon\ntransition, including within energy efficiency, energy transition, clean air and carbon reduction, smart mobility, the\ncircular economy, and the food revolution. Other topics covered include but were not limited to: climate-related\nlitigation and regulation, investing in (and the role of) oceans for climate resilience, and progress on key climate\nobjectives. We activated this content both internally and externally through a variety of channels, including video\ncontent, social media campaigns, podcasts in collaboration with industry partners, and an active presence on our\nwebpage.\nEngaging with the wider industry\nAs an asset allocator, Global Wealth Management is an active participant in industry forums to help raise awareness\nof the needs of private investors and family offices when it comes to climate-related investing. This includes\nfeedback to regulators on climate-related transparency and disclosures, as well as working groups with industry\npeers, such as within Swiss Sustainable Finance (SSF) and the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), and engaging\nwith fund management partners.\nWe continue to see a greater focus on, and demand for, transparency and disclosure around climate and\ndecarbonization, and we participate in dialogue with industry and regulators on these topics. Given the importance\nof transparency to private investors on new and emerging investment solutions around the low-carbon transition,\nwe collaborated and provided inputs for the initial and ongoing development of the SCS. Since the introduction of\nthe SCS, we have informed advisors on the content and how to deliver the information to clients that are interested.\nWe also make the reports published by UBS AG Asset Management and third-party managers on our platform (if\navailable) available through our UBS Quotes platform – and we will continue efforts to make this information more\neasily accessible in our digital environments. We also published our first Principal Adverse Impacts report to provide\ntransparency on offerings for investors at selected UBS legal entities within the scope of the Sustainable Finance\nDisclosure Regulation (SFDR), including key metrics on the climate footprint of our investments.\n2024 and beyond across our investing activities\nFollowing the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we have undertaken an extensive review of our approaches\nto setting decarbonization targets, to reflect the activities of the combined organization and evolving standards and\nmethodologies. Based on this assessment, we will deliver a revised 2030 target in 2024, which will cover the\ncombined UBS and Credit Suisse Asset Management business. Consequently, the Credit Suisse Climate Action Plan\npublished in December 2022 will be withdrawn in its entirety in 2024. Additionally, we are enhancing an in-house\nframework post Credit Suisse integration that delineates our key transition levers in investing.\n› Refer to “Appendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit Suisse AG” in the appendices to this report for progress\nmade towards Credit Suisse’s target on reduction of investment-associated emissions\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3377\nReducing our environmental impact\nA key element of our commitment to contribute toward a lower-carbon future is minimizing our own operational\nfootprint and supporting our employees, clients, suppliers and investors in the decarbonization of their activities.\nThat is why we aim to report accurately on our efforts to decrease GHG emissions. The environmental areas we\nfocus on in particular are energy, water, paper, waste and travel.\nFor 2023, we are disclosing the environmental footprint of the joint operations of UBS Group, including Credit\nSuisse, unless otherwise stated. Due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we have reviewed our combined\nportfolio and building strategy which in turn has affected the timeline of our ongoing initiatives across the regions.\nA further significant challenge in 2023 was the alignment of reporting methodologies for the Group’s quantified\nimpact on the environment. While both entities had previously reported in line with the GHG Protocol, there were\nnotable differences in the scopes, processes and tools.\nEnvironmental focus areas\nEnergy reduction and sustainable buildings\nWe enhanced our efforts to reduce operational energy consumption and optimize our corporate real estate portfolio.\nIn 2023, we lowered energy consumption1 by 8% compared with 2022. Several initiatives contributed to this\nreduction, for example, investing in more sustainable buildings and upgrading existing buildings by switching to\nenergy-saving LED lamps and modernizing heating systems and pumps.\nWe opted to disclose only renewable electricity in line with RE100 in this report as we are committed to achieving\n100% sourcing according to this high standard across the combined group. Due to the increased real estate\nportfolio globally, and limited supply in certain markets, we were able to procure 96% renewable electricity\naccording to RE100’s guidelines. Keeping with our high sustainability ambition, we will analyze a feasible timeline\nfor 100% RE100 compliance during 2024 and review our purchasing strategy to define acceptable quality criteria\non the way to full compliance.\nIn support of the RE100 ambition, we are increasing our onsite electricity production through photovoltaic systems.\nIn Switzerland, we expanded the existing photovoltaic installation at our Wolfsberg Conference Center and\nincreased our panel coverage on another building to generate an additional annual 122 MWh and 123 MWh,\nrespectively. We are in the process of increasing the number of power purchase agreements (PPAs) in Asia Pacific\nand are in advanced discussions about virtual power purchase agreements (vPPA) in the Americas.\nIn 2023, we achieved certifications for multiple locations across our global operations, aligned with internationally\nrenowned green-building standards. Two of our offices in Shenzhen, China, attained the Leadership in Energy and\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification in 2023, while our office in New Jersey received the WELL\nPlatinum certification. In Hong Kong SAR, all offices received accreditation from the Hong Kong Quality Assurance\nAgency for Green Banking Practices in Office Operations, making us the first international bank in the city to reach\nthis milestone. Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, we designed and fully implemented a new internal benchmark to rate\npotential real estate options based on their environmental impact and sustainability. This benchmark was built on\nfoundations from international standards, such as LEED and the Building Research Establishment Environmental\nAssessment Method (BREEAM) and Green Mark.\nReducing waste, paper and water\nIn 2023, we reduced our landfill waste by 21% compared with 2022, resulting in a decrease of approximately 546\nmetric tons globally. Our efforts regarding waste center on reducing overall waste and improving recycling rates. We\nimplemented various solutions, including composting organic and commercially compostable materials to generate\nenergy and other by-products. Simultaneously, we upgraded our recycling facilities while concurrently optimizing the\nrecycling process for furniture and the use of paper hand towels. In our efforts to achieve our ambition of zero waste\nto landfill, we rolled out a pilot program for one site in each region and also eliminated takeaway packaging at selected\nlocations. Despite these efforts, we have seen a waste increase per full-time equivalent of 16% compared with 2022.\nDuring 2024 we will identify measures to help break this trend. In light of the integration of Credit Suisse, we will\nreview our efforts and targets for waste across our combined real estate portfolio. UBS Group works with third parties\nto manage the waste generated by our organization. Our ISO 14001 environmental management program and\nadditional contract spot checks ensure that our waste management partners operate in accordance with contractual\nand legislative obligations.\n1 Includes all energy consumption reported for UBS Group\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3388\nPaper consumption per full-time employee increased by 27% compared with 2022, despite the launch of several\nawareness campaigns with our employees and our ongoing efforts to reduce the number of printers in our offices.\nOf the total amount of paper used, 65% was either sourced as recycled or was certified by the Forest Stewardship\nCouncil or equivalent labels. These measures help reduce the environmental impacts associated with paper\nproduction and manufacturing processes, such as deforestation or energy usage.\nWater conservation is a critical priority, its importance being amplified by severe droughts and global water scarcity.\nTo enhance water efficiency in our facilities we expanded our office’s environmental programs, for example, by\nmonitoring water use and optimizing flushing times and overflow management. Whilst implementing measures to\nthe contrary, we currently see an increase in water use by 17% compared to 2022. This is part of the rebound\neffect from the pandemic years when water consumption dropped to a minimum.\nTravel\nIn our ongoing commitment to advance sustainability in business travel, we focused our efforts on three key areas:\n– Strengthening our reporting with the enhanced carbon intensity metrics, thereby providing comprehensive\ninsights into travel-related emissions, both before and after trips, to measure and manage our travel footprint.\n– Updating our travel policy to encourage employees to opt for eco-friendly transportation options whenever\npossible. In addition, strengthening our partnerships with hotels that have embraced sustainable practices,\nmarking them prominently with green flags at the point of sale to help our staff make informed and conscious\nchoices.\n– Continuing to purchase high-quality carbon offsets that correspond with 100% of our air-travel emissions for\nUBS Group excluding Credit Suisse.\nBiodiversity\nWe have taken steps to protect biodiversity across our offices, mitigate the impact of our operations on nature and\nraise awareness among our staff. For example, installing green roofs at selected office locations, combined with\nemployee volunteering activities, such as Clean-Up Day and a program to highlight the critical role of bees to our\nnatural ecosystem, served to shine a spotlight on the critical role of biodiversity.\n› Refer to the “Appendix 2 – Environment” in the appendices to this report for more information on our approach to\nnature\nImpacts from our value chain\nIn addition to supplier engagement, we also worked to quantify and manage our relevant scope 3 emissions related\nto our operations. While further work is required, we are already providing increased transparency on these efforts.\n› Refer to “Monitoring the environmental impact of our supply chain” below and to the Supplement to the UBS\nGroup Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information\nOur environmental management system\nAll UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse’s environmental activities, including the entire scope of products, services\nand in-house operations, are subject to our environmental management system (EMS), which we run in accordance\nwith ISO 14001:2015. UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse separately successfully passed the ISO\n14001 audits every year since implementation, including in 2023. In the EU and the UK, our activities (excluding\nthose of Credit Suisse) are certified according to the ISO 50001:2018 energy management system standard.\nInformation on our GHG emissions and underlying information (energy, water, paper, waste, recycling and travel)\nis also included in our yearly GHG emissions report prepared in accordance with the ISO14064 1:2018 standard.\nThis report is subject to yearly external verification in accordance with the ISAE 3410 standard and also considering\nthe ISO 14064 3:2019 standard.\nThese sets of extensive audit standards ensure the appropriate policies and processes are in place, both for the\nmanagement of environmental and energy topics within our operations and for affirming their daily\nimplementation.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 3399\nUse of carbon offsets and carbon removal credits\nDuring the transition towards our decarbonization goals and as part of our beyond-value-chain mitigation we\ncontinue to purchase high-quality carbon offsets at an equivalent volume to match our net scope 1 and 2 emissions\nfrom our own operations, as well as our scope 3 air-travel emissions. These are verified against either the Gold\nStandard, or Verra VCS plus the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard which certifies the additional\ncontribution to Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs) beyond the carbon impact. In addition, our carbon offset\ncommitments undergo internal quality checks with our Sustainability and Climate Risk unit.\nIn 2023, for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, we continued to apply an internal carbon price of USD 400 per\nmetric ton for scope 1 and 2 emissions in our capital investment business cases in order to incentivize carbon\nreductions - for example by replacing fossil-fuel heating systems. The cost reflects the blended mix of permanent\ncarbon removals required to neutralize any residual emissions that cannot be otherwise abated. We continued\nworking with our partners Climeworks, Neustark and NextGen to support their efforts to provide scalable and\neffective solutions in the market and expect to start receiving the first carbon removal credit deliveries in 2025.\nEnvironmental targets and performance in our operations (UBS Group)1\nTarget % change Progress /\nGRI2 2023 2025 Baseline3 from baseline Achievement4 2022 2021\nTotal net greenhouse gas emissions (GHG footprint) in t CO 2e5 305 168,688 n/a6 359,360 -53 green 169,144 133,243\nScope 1 and net scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in t CO 2e 305 48,522 0 145,911 -67 amber 61,627 59,889\nEnergy consumption in GWh 302 797 -15% 1,064 -25 green 866 899\nShare of renewable electricity 302 95.6% 100% 76.6% 25 green 91.1% 92.3%\nPaper consumption in kg per FTE7 301 34.1 -50% 54.9 -38 amber 26.9 35.9\nShare of recycled and FSC paper 301 65.1% 100% 63% 3 amber 52.7% 61.2%\nWaste in kg per FTE7 306 77.1 -10% 133.5 -42 green 66.3 69.3\nZero waste to landfill8 306 21.4% 0% 31.6% -32 amber 30.5% 22.2%\nWaste recycling ratio 306 57.7% 60% 50% 15 amber 52.2% 61.5%\nWater consumption in m m³ 303 1.22 -5% 1.33 -8 green 1.04 0.84\nLegend: CO2e = CO2 equivalents; FTE = full-time employee; GWh = gigawatt hour; kWh = kilowatt hour; km = kilometer; kg = kilogram; m m³ = million cubic meters; t = metric ton\n1 Detailed environmental indicators are available at www.ubs.com/environment.

The STG also contributes by rethinking ways that we\ndevelop and deploy applications, store data and manage our infrastructure. The STG remains primarily focused on\nenergy consumption by the UBS technology estate, in addition to e-waste and use of precious metals. The STG\nachieved major milestones in 2023:\n– 50% energy savings from UBS Workspace migration;\n– 50% energy savings resulting from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) optimization in Group Finance; and\n– Sustainable Fundamental training completed by over 1,000 staff UBS Certified Engineers.\nThe STG has focused on four distinct tracks, all of which are sponsored by our senior management:\n– optimization of our on-premises technology estate to support more energy-efficient consumption, by ongoing\ndecommissioning of unused and power-intense technology components, as well as changes to hours of\noperation;\n– application development with sustainability in mind, achieved by providing transparency, using near real-time\nmetrics, to application owners about the environmental impact of their applications;\n– execution of our Cloud First strategy and continuous adoption of our primary strategic Cloud partner, Microsoft;\n– running internal campaigns to encourage employees in archive management of the applications and systems\nthat they are accountable for; and\n– building sustainable technology knowledge through focused training.\nHeading into 2024, the STG will also focus on:\n– continuing to raise awareness through a refreshed and re-launched campaign to all UBS Group technology staff;\n– taking a structured approach to identifying and implementing energy saving initiatives using public cloud to\ntarget cost and energy savings, modelled on the FinOps approach, also known as ‘GreenOps’; and\n– a renewed focus on Measurement & Tooling, based on lessons learned in this area.\nAcross all these initiatives, we continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure with newer and more efficient,\nmarket-leading infrastructure and technology vendors, moving some technology platform workloads from on-\npremises and private cloud servers to Microsoft Azure. In some specific use cases, this has yielded energy reductions\nof up to 30%. This year, our technology sustainability partnership with Microsoft has continued to strengthen with\nexecutive briefings and workshops conducted to discuss areas of collaboration and paths forward.\nWe are a Steering Member of the Green Software Foundation (GSF) and continue to partner closely with other\nmember organizations on a number of open-source projects that are exploring ways of reducing emissions from\nlarge technology estates. In 2023, GSF attained the ISO accreditation of the Software Carbon Intensity Specification\n(SCI) – a measure of software-related energy usage that was trialed on two applications at UBS.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 4411\nMonitoring the environmental impact of our supply\nchain\nIn line with our net-zero ambition, we are strengthening sustainable practices and engaging\nwith our suppliers on climate information disclosures to create transparency and\ncommitment to reducing GHG emissions within our supply chain.\nIn 2023, we invited 440 vendors, which accounted for 67% of our annual vendor spend, to disclose their\nenvironmental performance through CDP’s Supply Chain Program. We implemented a structured communication\nplan and conducted webinars to guide our vendors through the disclosure process and requirements to ensure they\nunderstood the need for, and importance of, declaring their emissions and committing to their own 2050-aligned\nnet-zero goals.\n70% of the invited vendors completed their climate disclosures via the CDP platform. The number of vendors\ncompleting disclosures increased by 74% from 176 in 2022 to 307 in 2023.\nClimate disclosures of our vendors\n440\n450\nVendor 266 307\n33% 67%\nspend\n+74%\n176\n0\nVendors invited to disclose emissions in CDP 2022 2023\nVendors completed disclosures in CDP\nWe have also established a baseline for supply chain vendor scope 3 emissions (categories 1 and 2 vendor-related)\nof 1.13 million metric tons of CO e for financial year 2023.\n2\nWe identified GHG key vendors (defined by us as those vendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our\nestimated vendor GHG emissions) in order to focus our efforts on the highest-impact vendors. In 2023, we revised\nand updated the list of GHG key vendors from 83 to 95 to include Credit Suisse vendors. We are engaging with\nour GHG key vendors, for 100% of them to declare their emissions and set net zero-aligned goals by 2026, and\nreduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with net-zero trajectories by 20351. We met with all our GHG key\nvendors, shared formal guidance through our vendor climate information declaration guideline and developed\ntailored engagement plans, based on the vendor’s maturity. In 2023, 65% of our GHG key vendors declared their\nemissions on CDP and also set 2050-aligned net-zero goals.\n1 In 2024, we may review our targets for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those\nvendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 4422\nGHG key vendors' climate disclosures\n100\n95\n83\n65% (62/95) 60%\n49% (41/83)\n30%\n0\n2022 2023\nTarget\nGHG key vendors that disclosed emissions on CDP and set net-zero-aligned goals\nGHG key vendors that did not disclose emissions on CDP and/or did not set net-zero-aligned goals\nInitiating focused emissions-reduction initiatives, we partnered with vendors that provide services from offshore\ndevelopment centers (ODCs) to foster responsible and sustainable practices in those facilities. Our approach is based\non proactive engagement with these vendors to reduce their environmental impact. To ensure transparency and\naccountability, we have established contractual agreements with six of our ODC vendors to disclose their scope 1,\n2 and 3 emissions and commit to achieving net zero by 2050. In addition, we have established three categories of\nsupplementary requirements for these ODC vendors: energy efficiency, waste management and paper\nconsumption. Our requirements include LEED Gold certification (or equivalent) for any new premises, a transition\nto 100% renewable electricity by 2030, waste recycling goals and a commitment to use sustainable paper. These\nwill be rolled out to Credit Suisse ODC vendors in 2024 and 2025.\nWe also collaborated with one of our IT software development services providers to train up 76% of this vendor’s\nsoftware engineers who are engaged in providing services to us on GSF certification. The training serves as a catalyst\nfor software developers to learn environmentally-conscious coding practices, which in turn accelerates the reduction\nof carbon emissions from software. By providing developers with specialized knowledge and skills in sustainable\nsoftware development, they are empowered to create code for UBS that is inherently energy-efficient and\nenvironmentally responsible.\n› Refer to our vendor climate information declaration guideline, available at ubs.com/suppliers\n› Refer to the “Supplement to Environment” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information on methodologies applied\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 4433\nManaging the risks of climate change to our business\nWe define sustainability and climate risk as the risk that UBS negatively impacts, or is impacted by, climate change,\nnatural capital, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Sustainability and\nclimate risks may manifest as credit, market, liquidity business and non-financial risks for UBS, resulting in potential\nadverse financial, liability and reputational impacts. We manage sustainability and climate risk within a dedicated\nrisk management framework. In 2023 we worked to revise this framework and our processes across UBS, following\nthe acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group AG.\n› Refer to the “Managing sustainability and climate risks” section of this report for further details\nSustainability Report 2023 | Environment 4444\nSocial\nPeople and culture make the difference\nDriving sustainable performance\nWe are dedicated to being a world-class employer and a place where people can unlock their full potential. With\nmore than 115,000 employees working in 52 countries, our global presence, expertise and range of business\nactivities help us to make a positive difference for our clients, colleagues and communities.\nOur employees execute our business strategy and deliver the products and services our clients need. This is why we\ninvest in our people, aiming to attract, develop and retain employees with the diverse skills, capabilities,\nbackgrounds and experiences that can enable us to achieve our goals.\nGood corporate citizenship principles are embedded into our employment practices, for example in the benefits we\noffer, our fair pay practices, and our commitment to increase our workforce diversity. As a founding member of\nthe World Economic Forum’s Good Work Framework, we partner with like-minded companies to develop and\nimplement metrics that support high-quality work worldwide.\n› Refer to “Driving social impact” in this section for information about our community impact and employee\nvolunteering activities\nAs part of the integration of Credit Suisse, we examined our people management landscape. Our analysis showed\nthat nearly all of Credit Suisse’s workforce and demographic data is compatible with ours, allowing us to report\nconsolidated figures in this report, unless otherwise stated.

It is based on our\nthree keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors. These keys drive our business decisions and people\nmanagement processes. In the second half of 2023, familiarizing our new colleagues with our three keys to success\nand building a unified culture across our combined organization were top priorities. To support this process, during\n2023, we established a forum to focus on culture integration which is chaired by the Head Group Human Resources\nand Group Corporates Services and composed of senior management representatives and select external advisors,\nto oversee culture integration across our firm.\n› Refer to the “Governance” section of this report for more information on key governance bodies pertaining to ESG\nmatters\nCulture-building behavior is promoted through a number of Group-wide, divisional and regional initiatives. One\nexample is Three Keys on Air. In 2023, this Group-wide series highlighted key aspects of our culture, including\nmaximizing performance, psychological safety in high-performing teams, and improving risk management. In\naddition, the Group Franchise Awards (GFA) program recognized employees for cross-divisional collaboration and\nsuggesting innovative or simplification ideas. In 2023, more than 1,800 ideas were submitted for consideration.\nThe global peer-to-peer appreciation program (called Kudos) makes it easy for employees to recognize and\nappreciate their colleagues’ above-and-beyond behavior, serving to promote excellence and increase engagement\nand employee satisfaction. In 2023, our employees gave nearly 439,000 Kudos recognitions. Credit Suisse\nemployees participated in Recognizing and Valuing Excellence (RAVE), a similar peer-to-peer recognition program.\nThe GFA program and Kudos will be rolled out to the entire organization starting in 2024.\n› Refer to ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/our-culture.html for details about our three keys to success\nHiring, developing and retaining talent\nHow effectively we attract, develop and retain a talented workforce is reflected in our long-term success. In 2023,\nwe hired a total of 11,435 external candidates across the Group, and developed more than 3,720 graduates and\nother trainees, apprentices and interns in programs around the world. The combined organization is a major\napprenticeship provider in Switzerland, and we actively promote multi-year apprenticeship programs in Switzerland\nand the UK, along with summer internship programs and work-study programs in the US, EMEA, Asia Pacific and\nSwitzerland.\n› Refer to the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023 or to ubs.com/global/en/careers/awards.html\nfor employer ratings and recognitions\nWe are committed to hybrid-working options wherever possible. In 2023, most of our employees were eligible to\nwork partially from home, depending on their role, regulatory restrictions and location, as well as divisional or\nfunctional requirements. Pre-acquisition UBS and Credit Suisse Group already had similar programs in place, and\nthese will be aligned over the course of the integration. For those with hybrid-working arrangements, regular in-\noffice days promote team building, collaboration and a sense of belonging, all of which are key to integrating our\nbusinesses and shaping a unified identity and culture. Hybrid-working arrangements, along with options such as\nflexible locations or hours, part-time working, job sharing and partial retirement help employees thrive throughout\ntheir careers, while attracting a wider range of candidates and making us an even more adaptive and responsive\ncompany.\nTalent management\nWe take a systematic approach to talent management. Annual talent and succession reviews help ensure that we\nhave strong talent pipelines and succession plans. We aim to create a culture of cross-divisional and international\nmobility for early-career talent, mid-career professionals and senior leaders. Group-wide talent programs are offered\nacross the organization, and supplemented by specific programs in the business divisions, functions and regions.\nPrograms range from those targeting senior leaders to junior talent, in addition to those open to women and\nemployees from diverse backgrounds. To support line managers, we offer targeted development for new line\nmanagers and those who want to improve on various aspects. Regular leadership events align business heads with\nour strategy and further our corporate and cultural integration.\nInternal mobility is a key component of talent management, with line managers expected to support individual\ndevelopment and job mobility. In 2023, we filled many of our roles with internal candidates1 – 38.8% of all hires,\n40.5% of all female hires, 30.9% of UK ethnic minorities hires and 31.4% of US ethnic minority hires.\n1 Internal candidates refers only to UBS and Credit Suisse employees moving internally. Credit Suisse employees moving to UBS are not considered to be internal\nmobility but rather external hires.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 4466\nEmployees can explore career paths, search for jobs and short-term rotation opportunities, and connect with\nmentors on our Career Navigator platform. In 2023, more than 44,000 employees of UBS Group excluding Credit\nSuisse accessed our internal job board, 313 participated in a short-term rotation opportunity, and 1,056 participated\nin mentoring relationships. Credit Suisse employees are expected to have full Career Navigator access during 2024.\nWe deliver internal training and development via our UBS University platform. Our offering includes client advisor\ncertification and regulatory, business, and line manager training, alongside modules on topics such as culture,\nsustainable finance, data literacy, and well-being. In addition, our learning experience platform makes AI-powered\ntraining recommendations based on an employee’s needs and interests. Credit Suisse employees transitioned to\nthe UBS University platform in January 2024. UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse invested approximately USD 92.7\nmillion in training in 2023, with permanent (UBS Group) employees completing more than 2.3 million learning\nactivities (including mandatory training on compliance, business, and other topics). This was an average of 1.91\ntraining days per employee.\nPerformance management\nOur performance management approach reflects our strategy and supports our high-performance culture. The\nObjective-setting process fosters accountability with objectives focused on outcomes to align the organization on\nwhat matters most. To support appropriate management of risks and a strong and proactive risk culture, all\nemployees set a risk-related objective. Further, we consider both performance- and behavior-related objectives\nbecause we value not only “what” an employee accomplishes but also “how” they accomplish it and demonstrate\nour behaviors – accountability with integrity, collaboration, and innovation.\nAn embedded Feedback app allows employees to easily give and receive feedback in real time throughout the year,\nsupporting continuous improvement. We counted more than 296,330 instances of feedback across the combined\norganization by the end of 2023, and 100% of eligible employees received a performance review for the year.\nSelf- and line manager reviews, along with additional management discussions to validate performance, help\nsupport fair and transparent decision-making. Line managers play a key role in the quality of our approach and are\nultimately responsible for year-end performance decisions. Leaders at all levels are also expected to role-model our\nHouse View on Leadership. Its principles are integrated into all of our core HR processes, including hiring,\nperformance management, training, succession planning, and promotions.\nFor 2023 year-end, we ran a combined fully integrated performance management approach for all employees,\nincluding our Credit Suisse colleagues. Supporting a one-bank employee experience helps all employees understand\nwhat matters most to drive a sustainable high-performance culture. The completion of our year-end approach is a\nsignificant milestone for our organization and a success that accelerates our cultural integration journey.\nEmployee engagement\nOur employees want to be heard and are involved in shaping their daily experience. As such, we provide\nopportunities throughout the year for them to share their views and to connect with management on topics ranging\nfrom strategy and engagement to the work environment.\nIn 2023, we conducted employee lifecycle surveys, in-depth analyses of specific business issues, and “pulse” surveys\nto learn about employees’ views and concerns. One such pulse survey, conducted across the combined organization\nin November 2023, showed high levels of psychological safety, respect, collaboration and empowerment. In\nparticular, 87% of respondents reported experiencing a professional and respectful work environment, and 83%\nreported that their function collaborates well with different areas. Further, 77% of respondents felt empowered to\nmake decisions and 86% felt able to speak up and raise concerns2. All of these results are above the financial\nservices benchmark3.\nEmployee feedback in 2023 also included virtual focus-group sessions with more than 5,000 participants across the\ncombined organization. Those conversations, along with feedback received through our internal communications\nchannels and various events, allowed employees to share their perspective and insights on the integration, and\nprovided employee sentiment data points to track progress.\n2 Result shown is the sum of “strongly agree” and “agree” scale. Questions: 1) In my business division or function, we provide a professional and respectful work\nenvironment, 2) Where I work, we collaborate well with different areas, 3) I'm empowered to make appropriate decisions in my job and 4) I am able to speak up\nand raise concerns if I see things I consider to be wrong\n3 Benchmarks provided by Ipsos Karian and Box as of Q3 2023\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 4477\nIn addition, a dedicated online integration hub, accessible to both UBS and Credit Suisse employees from the date\nof the legal close, enabled us to communicate key strategic, organizational and operational decisions and\ninformation, and to start building a unified identity and culture. Initiatives like our regular “Ask the CEO” event\ngave employees the chance to learn about (and ask questions on) topics such as strategy and direction.\nEmployee representation\nIn addition to seeking out employee feedback, we maintain an open dialogue with our formal employee\nrepresentation groups. We have European works councils representing 17 countries and consider topics related to\nour performance and operations. Local works councils (such as the UBS Employee Representation Committee and\nthe Credit Suisse Staff Council in Switzerland) discuss benefits, workplace conditions and redundancies, among\nother topics. Collectively, these groups represent approximately 51.5% of our global workforce.\nWhere applicable, our operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements (CBA). Benefits are aligned with\nlocal markets and often go beyond legal requirements or market practice.\nFair and equitable pay\nFair and consistent pay practices are designed to ensure that employees are appropriately rewarded for their\ncontribution. We pay for performance, and we take pay equity seriously. We have embedded clear commitments\nin our global compensation policies and practices. We regularly conduct internal reviews and independent external\naudits on pay equity, and our statistical analyses show a differential between men and women in similar roles across\nour major locations of less than 1%.\nIn 2020, we completed an equal pay analysis in Switzerland, as required by the Swiss Federal Act on Gender\nEquality. The results confirmed that we are fully compliant with Swiss equal pay standards. Beginning in 2020, Pre-\nacquisition UBS was certified (through 2023) by the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation4 for our HR practices, including\ncompensation, in Switzerland, the US, UK, the Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, covering more than two-thirds of\nour global employee population.\nAll of our HR policies are global, and we apply the same standards across all locations. Furthermore, we review our\napproach and policies annually to support our continuous improvement. In 2023, we fully integrated former Credit\nSuisse Group employees into all of our fair pay practices and continued to monitor and improve our pay equity\nposition in our leading countries.\nWe also aim to ensure that all employees are paid at least a living wage5. We regularly assess employees’ salaries\nagainst local living wages, using benchmarks defined by the Fair Wage Network. Our analysis in 2023 showed that\nemployees’ salaries were at or above the respective benchmarks.\n› Refer to our UBS Compensation Report 2023 at ubs.com/annualreporting and to ubs.com/diversity for our 2023 UK\nGender & Ethnicity Pay Gap report\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives in the compensation process\nOur compensation determination process considers ESG objectives in objective-setting, performance award pool\nfunding, performance evaluation and individual compensation decisions. ESG-related objectives have been\nembedded in our Pillars and Principles since they were established in 2011. In 2021, we introduced explicit\nsustainability objectives in the non-financial category of the Group CEO and GEB performance scorecards. In 2023,\nwe further enhanced the GEB performance scorecard framework by establishing separate Environmental &\nSustainability and People & Governance categories. The objectives in these categories are linked to our sustainability\npriorities, and their progress is measured via robust quantitative metrics and qualitative criteria. Sustainability\nobjectives are assessed for each GEB member on an individual basis, directly impacting their respective performance\nassessments and compensation decisions.\nThe determination of the Group performance award pool funding also takes into account ESG factors. Aside from\nfinancial performance, an assessment of progress is made against objectives linked to our focus areas of Planet\n(including climate-related goals), People (including progress made against our diversity aspirations) and\nPartnerships, alongside other key non-financial considerations.\n4 For more information on the gender certification, refer to the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation website\n5 Excluding our US financial advisor staff (as their compensation is primarily based on a formulaic approach).\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 4488\nTherefore, ESG is taken into consideration when the Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee assesses\nperformance and compensation for GEB members. Additionally, the assessment impacts the overall performance\naward pool for the Group. Going forward, we will continue to review and refine the role of ESG considerations in\nour performance and compensation framework to ensure they remain aligned to our strategic priorities and the\nsustainable growth of shareholder value.\n› Refer to “GEB performance assessments” in the UBS Compensation Report 2023 for more information\n› Refer to “Our focus on sustainability and climate,” “Employees,” and “Social impact” in our UBS Group Annual\nReport 2023 available on ubs.com/annualreport for more information\n› Refer to ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for more information about ESG-related topics\nEmployee support\nWe are committed to being a responsible employer, and that includes supporting our employees’ health and well-\nbeing. Social, physical, mental and financial well-being elements are woven into our HR policies and practices, as\nwell as into employee-focused initiatives to increase awareness and educate employees on how to improve their\nwell-being. Supporting employee health and well-being remained a priority in 2023. Resources to support holistic\nwell-being included a range of programs, benefits and workplace resources, along with a bespoke eLearning\ncurriculum that aimed at helping our employees manage their health, foster well-being, strengthen their resilience,\nand support the sustainability of the organization. For example, in the first part of 2023, UBS became a founding\npartner of #WorkingWithCancer to improve our support for employees impacted by cancer.\nDuring the second half of 2023, we focused on helping our employees across the combined organization adapt to\nchanges related to the integration of Credit Suisse. In this context, we expanded our offering to include guidelines\nand instructor-led sessions on managing organizational change, uncertainty, and resilience. Credit Suisse employees\nalso had access to holistic personal health coaching support.\nBenefits and assistance\nAll our employees have access to competitive benefits, such as healthcare, well-being and retirement benefits,\ninsurance (such as life and disability insurance), and flexible leave policies. Benefits are set in the context of local\nmarket practice and are regularly reviewed for competitiveness.\nEmployee assistance programs and internal teams help employees and their family members manage personal or\nwork-related issues that may affect their well-being. UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse’s absentee rate in 2023\nwas 1.9% globally and Credit Suisse’s absentee rate was 2.3% in Switzerland6 of total scheduled days, according\nto the number of illness or accident absences recorded in the respective self-service HR tools.\nIn 2023, we announced that the social plans or severance payments at UBS and Credit Suisse in the respective\ncountries will be aligned to ensure that all employees are treated equally. The terms of the social plans or severance\npayments are harmonized according to a “best of both” principle to support employees affected by redundancy7.\nShould business or organizational circumstances arise that lead to employee redundancy, we offer redeployment\nand outplacement services with a key focus on redeployment within UBS and we have significantly increased the\nbudget for education and training in all business divisions and regions. Those services are designed to help\nemployees find new internal roles or to transition out of UBS. We believe that these measures help skilled employees\nwho are affected by restructuring to position themselves favorably on the labor market within or outside the\nfinancial services industry. Additionally, employees considering retirement have access to various resources to help\nprepare them for this transition, including access to educational sessions and individual assistance.\n› Refer to the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023 for UBS’s health and safety statement\n› Refer to ubs.com/employees for more information about benefits and assistance\nEqual opportunities and whistleblowing\nBuilding a high-performing and inclusive workplace includes providing equitable access to employment and\nadvancement opportunities. We are an equal opportunity employer, and our policies do not tolerate harassment\nof any kind. We have measures in place to prevent bullying, victimization, harassment, and retaliation, as well as\nanti-harassment representatives who independently review relevant training, policies and protocols.\n6 Credit Suisse does not currently and has not in the past reported absenteeism globally, as Credit Suisse’s systems capture this data on a regional rather than\nglobal level and definitions between regions differ, impacting the accuracy of a global number.\n7 Due to local legal or consultation requirements, in five countries alignment remains in progress\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 4499\nOur policies encourage employees to raise concerns openly and to report any potential violations of our Code of\nConduct and Ethics (the Code). Group-wide, staff have multiple ways (including confidential whistleblowing\nhotlines and online applications that offer anonymity) to raise concerns about any suspected breach of laws,\nregulations, rules or other legal requirements, policies, sexual misconduct or harassment, or any violation of the\nCode. We do not tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee who reports a concern that they reasonably\nbelieve is a breach or violation.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\nAt UBS, we aim to build a culture of belonging, where employees from all backgrounds and identities can feel\nrecognized and valued, and where everyone can unlock their full potential. To succeed, we need to enable UBS to\ndeliver the greatest possible impact for our stakeholders – both external (our clients, our communities and society,\nand our suppliers) and internal (our employees). Our employee diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)8 strategy is\nbuilt on four pillars: how we hold ourselves accountable, how we hire, how we develop talent and how we build a\nculture of belonging. We leverage all four pillars as we move toward achieving our ambitious gender and ethnic\ndiversity aspirations, disability integration and in creating an inclusive culture for all.\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more information about our clients\n› Refer to the “Driving social impact” section of this report for more information on the topic of community and\nsociety\n› Refer to the “Managing our supply chain responsibly” section of this report for more information about our\nsuppliers\nAccountable\nOur accountability framework embodies the oversight of the GEB and its commitment to achieving our aspirational\ngoals, along with empowering leaders to drive our DE&I strategy forward. We use data monitoring, fair pay\npractices, management dashboards, and toolkits to support accountability. All GEB members and their leadership\nteams are evaluated on their efforts toward achieving our aspirations. Furthermore, supporting business-led DE&I\ncouncils and people forums ensures that accountability is a shared responsibility Group-wide. Externally, we partner\nwith initiatives such as the UK government’s Women in Finance Charter to support the progression of women into\nsenior roles and to publicly report on progress.\nWe also believe that transparency is key to achieving our aspirations. In 2020, we outlined specific intentions to\nincrease our female and ethnic minority representation, especially among management. Specifically, by 2025, we\naspire to have 30% of Director level9 and above roles globally held by women and 26% of Director level and above\nroles in the US and the UK held by ethnic-minority talent, along with additional regional aspirations. Our DE&I\naspirations remain unchanged for the combined organization and the Credit Suisse DE&I aspirations have been\nretired.\n8 For all data in the DE&I section of this report, 2023 data reflects the combined firm unless otherwise stated. Prior-year data reflects UBS only, unless otherwise\nstated.\n9 We informed employees that as of 1 April 2024, the firm will adapt its organizational titles to the UBS structure. This change is primarily one of nomenclature;\nrole, responsibilities, employment terms and conditions are all unchanged. The title of managing director is unchanged. Credit Suisse directors will become\nexecutive directors, and vice presidents will become directors. Assistant vice presidents/associates will become associate directors. Employees with a staff title will\nultimately be aligned to either employee or authorized officer, depending on their role, responsibilities, and experience and following a thorough review by\nmanagement, supported by HR.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5500\n2025 aspirational goals\nDirector level and above\nWomen, global Ethnic minorities, UK\n29.5% 30% 24.3% 26%\nRacial/ethnic\nBlack, UK minorities, US\n2.1% 4% 25.1% 26%\nFinancial advisors/client advisors¹\nRacial/ethnic\nWomen, Americas minorities, US\n16.8% 25% 12.2% 18.8%\n2023 actuals 2025 aspirational goals\n1 FA/CA population refers to UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse.\nIt is important to note that improving representation is rarely linear. Moreover, progress is based in part on drivers\nlike promotion rates, as well as on various business and market conditions, employees’ willingness to self-disclose\ndemographic information, and other factors. We therefore aim to ensure that every element of our people\nmanagement process is a positive influence. For instance, implementing processes and controls to mitigate\nunconscious bias in the hiring process, talent reviews and promotions have helped to maintain a continuous line of\nprogress, with the number of diverse new hires, promotions and retentions slowly improving our overall\nrepresentation, particularly regarding female and ethnic minority employees.\nFor example, women now account for 40.9% of our workforce and 29.5% of our Director level and above\npopulation, up from 27.8% in 2022 and 26.7% in 2021. Women also represent 30.5% of management positions,\nand 22.6% of management positions in revenue-generating functions. In addition, 37.5% of members of the GEB\nand 33.3% of members of the Board of Directors (BoD) are women, as are 30.3% of senior managers who report\ndirectly to a member of the GEB.\nDue to variations in legal requirements and historical progress, we take a country-specific approach to increasing\nthe representation of ethnic minorities, with a particular focus on making progress in the US and the UK, where\nethnicity data is more readily available. As at the end of 2023, ethnic minorities held 24.3% of Director level and\nabove roles in the UK, up from 23.4% in 2022 and 21.9% in 2021, and 2.1% of these roles were Black talent. As\nat the end of 2023, ethnic minorities held 25.1% of Director level and above roles in the US, up from 20.5% in\n2022 and 20.1% in 2021.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5511\nHire\nOver the past five years, we have put strong foundational processes in place to optimize diverse hiring even in\nuncertain markets and times of considerable attrition. We continue to focus on training recruiters and hiring\nmanagers to help mitigate unconscious bias in the hiring process and hire the best-suited candidate for each role,\nregardless of background. In 2023, our hiring ratios were strong for women at all levels (43.3% hired compared\nwith 40.9% headcount representation). Our ethnicity hiring ratios improved for US talent (46.9% hired compared\nwith 31.9% headcount representation), UK talent (40.4% hired compared with 29.2% headcount representation),\nand for UK Black talent (16.4% hired compared with 3.6% headcount representation).\nTo support talent who have been out of the workforce, our UBS Career Comeback and the Credit Suisse Real\nReturns programs were designed to support talent returning from a longer career break or career shift. Introduced\nin 2016 and offered globally since 2019, UBS Career Comeback helped 19 participants (15 women and 4 men)\nreturn to corporate jobs in 2023, and a total of 253 individuals since its inception. Since the launch of the Credit\nSuisse Real Returns program in 2014, 363 of the 543 participants were hired into permanent roles after the\nprogram. In 2023, the program helped 11 participants (10 women and 1 man). Going forward, the Credit Suisse\nprogram will be retired.\nDevelop\nPart of building an inclusive workplace is providing equitable access to advancement opportunities. To help ensure\nemployees at all career stages have equitable development opportunities, we sponsor key talent and leadership\ndevelopment programs. As examples, in 2023, our new Growth Alignment Experience was launched for Associate\nDirector and Director level employees of UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse in the US identified through a self-\nnomination process. Over a six-month period, 50 initial participants worked with external coaching professionals\nto enhance their strategic planning skills, expand their networks and build connections. Selected ethnic-minority\nemployees in the UK at Associate Director and Director levels were invited to participate in Not in Your Image, a\nnine-month development program to build skills and leadership readiness in which they were paired with a senior\nsponsor for longer-term career development. In addition, in the US and the UK, we participate in the Executive\nLeadership Council’s Institute for Leadership Development and Research, which offers leadership development and\naction-based planning for Black professionals, to facilitate individual growth that in turn strengthens our talent\npipeline.\nThe strength and potential of our development programs and talent processes were reflected in female promotion\nrates for 2023 at Director, Executive Director and Managing Director levels. For example, 35.6% of Director level\nand above promotions were female (compared with 31.5% in 2022). Similarly, the US ethnic minority rate for\nDirector level and above promotions was 33.9% in 2023 (vs. 19.6% in 2022) and the UK ethnic minority rate for\nDirector level and above promotions was 28.7% in 2023 (vs. 24.8% in 2022).\nBelong\nA sense of belonging helps drive engagement and is important for overall well-being. We strive to create an\nenvironment where every employee feels they have a place and are recognized and respected for who they are and\nwhat they add to our workplace. Many of our policies, including fair pay and equal opportunities, along with highly\nvalued employee options such as hybrid working arrangements, support a workplace environment that fosters\nbelonging. In the same way, our 64 combined employee networks are vital to building a sense of belonging and\nstrengthening our inclusive culture. Whether the topic is gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, culture, ethnic\ndiversity, cultural background, disability, parenting, elder care, veteran status or life stage, employee volunteers in\nevery region host numerous events every year to promote understanding, engagement and belonging, and to\nsupport our overall DE&I strategy. One of our networks’ key offerings is mentoring, including reverse mentoring.\nFor example, our race and ethnicity and gender networks use mentoring programs to help members level up\nopportunities for career development. Allyship initiatives further extend engagement and reach, particularly for\ngender, gender identity, and ethnicity efforts.\nAll employee networks were integrated by the end of 2023, enabling us to combine programming and resources\nand to extend our networks’ impact to a much larger audience.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5522\nOur commitment to the Valuable 500, a global business collective of 500 CEOs and their companies, who innovate\nin support of disability inclusion, also continues to be a primary focus. We uphold this commitment by providing a\nbarrier-free application, recruiting and onboarding process for all candidates, providing inclusive disability\nawareness training for HR professionals with a focus on working with people with disabilities. Providing toolkits for\nline managers and all employees enables them to leverage disability etiquette, facilitate accessible meetings, and\nmore, and we support and promote our Ability employee networks, world-wide. In 2023, we also implemented\nrobust global accessibility standards that inform our Disability strategy, and our digital accessibility and IT specialists\nbegan implementing the latest international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2) to further enhance\nand optimize our digital accessibility.\n› Refer to ubs.com/diversity for additional information on diversity, equity and inclusion topics and progress against\nour aspirational goals\n› Refer to ubs.com/employees or ubs.com/careers for more topics of interest to employees and potential applicants\n› Refer to the “Supporting our strategic goals – our engagement in partnerships” section of the Supplement to the\nUBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about\nour external commitments pertaining to DE&I\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5533\nDriving social impact\nSocial Impact has continued to be a strong differentiator, with its activities underpinning our sustainability and\nimpact strategy. With the integration of Credit Suisse, we will continue to put clients and people first across the\ncombined organization, helping clients maximize their impact locally and globally.\nOur vision is to contribute to and scale an impact economy, an economy that values the\nwell-being of all people and the planet. This means building partnerships that drive greater\nimpact transparency, more impact ventures and innovative ways of financing and paying for\nimpact.\nPhilanthropy services and collective impact\nMore than half of the world’s population is still not covered by essential health services.1 More than 648 million live\nbelow the international poverty line, with up to 40 million living in modern slavery.2 Over 600 million young people\nlack basic mathematics and literacy skills.3 Adding to these challenges, climate change and the degradation of\nnature are furthering inequalities. Despite exponential growth, philanthropy alone is not enough to fill the funding\ngap required.\nWe believe that by working collectively, philanthropists and public and private organizations have the potential to\ncreate lasting change and maximize a positive impact for people and planet. We provide comprehensive advice,\ninsights and execution services, working with our clients and finding ways to tackle some of the world’s most\npressing social and environmental problems. We aim to mobilize USD 1 billion in philanthropic capital and positively\nimpact over 26.5 million people by 2025 (cumulated since 2021).\nCollective impact\nThe power of philanthropic partnerships will be critical in achieving systemic scalable change. Led by our in-house\nphilanthropy team, we have three Collectives comprising philanthropists who bring together their efforts, skills and\nresources during a two-year learning journey. By combining our expertise and investor capital, our aim is to fund\ninitiatives that address child protection, climate change, and health and education-related issues. Each Collective\nprovides investors with the opportunity to work alongside peers and expert practitioners to achieve systemic\nchange. An important part of the Collectives journey is for clients to experience the impact of those programs they\nare funding.\nMembers of the UBS Collectives, namely, the Accelerate Collective, the Climate Collective and the Transform\nCollective, concluded their two-year journey in 2023, with new cohorts for each Collective ready to launch in\nJanuary 2024.\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations’ program team is key in supporting the impact of the UBS Collectives\nand identifying the partners we work with across the three Collectives in order to ensure our clients are making an\neffective and scalable impact.\nHelping our clients structure their philanthropy – donor-advised funds\nDonor-advised funds offer clients an alternative charitable-giving vehicle to set up their own foundations, offering\ngreater choice and personalization, and are managed in line with their usual investment approach. Their charitable\ndonations can be invested within the parameters they select (such as capital, growth or income), helping them\ngrow their fund to give grants at a later date. Administrative fees are borne by UBS. UBS offers these services in\nSwitzerland, Singapore and the UK, and in 2023 they were launched in the Hong Kong SAR, with USD 317.7 million\nin donations in 2023.4\n1 Based on information from the World Health Organization, see who.int/news/item/18-09-2023-billions-left-behind-on-the-path-to-universal-health-coverage\n2 Based on information from the World Bank, see https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day# and\nhttps://www.iom.int/news/more-40-million-modern-slavery-152-million-child-labour-around-world\n3 Based on information from UNICEF, see https://www.unicef.org/education\n4 Figures provided for UBS Optimus network of foundations and donor-advised funds are based on unaudited management accounts and information available\nas of January 2024.

Since the program started in 2016, we have onboarded and supported 85\nentrepreneurs to accelerate their impact.\nUBS Optimus network of foundations\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations also aims to contribute to an impact economy that meets the long-term\nneeds of children and preserves the natural environment, now and in the future. It connects clients with programs\nthat are making a measurable, long-term difference to the most serious and enduring social and environmental\nproblems. With a 24-year track record, it is focused on incubating impact ventures, scaling impact through\npartnerships and achieving impact transparency. In 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations had a presence\nin 9 global locations. It is now working on harmonizing the Credit Suisse program portfolio.\nIn 2023, it raised USD 328 million in donations, including UBS matching contributions, and committed USD 305.9\nmillion in grants from the Foundation.4,5 Key activities of the UBS Optimus network of foundations in 2023 are set\nout below.\nSocial and blended finance\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations is actively developing larger-scale investment vehicles, in partnership with\nother parts of the bank, by using a blended finance approach. In 2023, it secured major investor commitments for\na USD 100 million SDG Outcomes blended finance initiative with Bridges Outcomes Partnership, British International\nInvestment (the UK’s development finance institution) and the US International Development Finance Corporation.\nThese anchor investors participated alongside private investors, including Legatum, family offices (such as the Tsao\nFamily Office) and other high net worth individuals.\nPartnerships\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations works to build capabilities, capacity and partnerships to strengthen the\nsocial finance ecosystem. In 2023, it selected eight organizations for the first cohort of the 100x Impact Accelerator,\na global impact accelerator based at the London School of Economics. Seven of the eight selected ventures operate\nin emerging markets and six out of the eight have female founders or co-founders. Its objective is to work closely\nwith these entrepreneurs as they grow into social zebra organizations.6 Each organization received GBP 150,000 in\ncapital and participated in a 12-week program focusing on scale, impact measurement and fundraising strategies.\nIn 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations continued to develop its partnership with the State Secretariat\nfor Economic Affairs, the Swiss Development Cooperation Agency and the Credit Suisse Foundation. One objective\nof the SDG Impact Finance Initiative is to raise CHF 100 million for innovative financial solutions which can mobilize\nnew capital around the SDGs, and work toward our target of unlocking CHF 1 billion in private finance by 2030,\nthereby accelerating progress toward delivering the SDGs. In 2023, the four founding donors committed nearly a\nthird of the fundraising target and started disbursing grants to the seven winners of its first call for proposals,\ntackling climate change, education access and quality, smallholder farming and SME support.\nImpact transparency\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations’ vision is for impact to be measured using the highest quality standards\nand for that information to be publicly available for the benefit of all. In 2023, it developed and rolled out an owned\nindustry-aligned rating tool that aims to assess programs against three impact categories: breadth of impact; depth\nand proof of impact; and likelihood of scaling and sustaining impact. This facilitates: the prioritization of programs\nthat contribute the most to the UBS Optimus network of foundations’ strategic impact objectives; the identification\nof anticipated value added; the documentation of actions that can be taken to improve the program and impact\npotential, and the consistent and transparent communication of complex information around its impact objectives.\nIn 2024, the UBS Optimus network of foundations will be assessing how the impact rating tool can bring\nadditionality to the social impact landscape globally.\n4 Figures provided for UBS Optimus network of foundations and donor-advised funds are based on unaudited management accounts and information available\nas of January 2024. Audited financial statements for Optimus and donor-advised foundation entities are produced and available per local market regulatory\nguideline.\n5 The UBS Optimus network of foundations receives donations from all Business Divisions, with the majority stemming from Global Wealth Management.\n6 A Zebra represents a business model that strives for both profitability and positive societal impact, with a strong focus on sustainability, community involvement\nand cooperation. This concept is presented as an alternative to the traditional Silicon Valley unicorn model that often prioritizes rapid growth and high returns\nover other considerations.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5555\nEmergency philanthropy\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations and Social Impact raise funds and support partners providing emergency\nrelief in response to disaster situations, and sometimes launch dedicated appeals to support these efforts. Whenever\nan appeal is launched by the UBS Optimus network of foundations, it will act swiftly and mobilize funding from\nclients and employees to support immediate relief, as well as longer-term recovery and resilience.\nWhere budgets allow, it also aims to provide unrestricted support to emergency-relief-focused NGOs, so that it\ncontributes toward strengthening the humanitarian ecosystem; supports the development of monitoring,\nevaluation and learning capacities and evidence-based decision-making by implementing partners; and supports\nforgotten crises that receive little media attention.\nIn 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations raised and started to distribute more than USD 25.4 million for\nthe Turkey and Syria earthquake, the Hawaiian wildfires, flooding in Pakistan and Italy and people affected by the\nhumanitarian crisis in Israel and Gaza. It also continued to distribute USD 56 million raised for the Ukraine Relief\nFund launched in 2022. To date USD 43.3 million has been granted to our partners on the ground.\nUBS’s charitable contributions\nDirect cash contributions by UBS AG (including through partnerships in the communities that we operate in) and\nour affiliated foundations in Switzerland, as well as contributions to the UBS Optimus network of foundations,\namounted to USD 62.6 million in 2023.7\n› Refer to the “Supplement to Social” in the Supplement to this report available on ubs.com/sustainability-reporting\nfor an overview of our charitable contributions in 2023 and additional information\nCommunities\nWe aim to maximize our impact in the local communities that we are a part of because we recognize that our long-\nterm success depends on their health and prosperity. We regard our ongoing investment in these areas as central\nto furthering the economic and social inclusion of those people that our activities support. We have a strategic\nfocus on education and the development of skills, as we believe these topics are where our resources can make the\nmost impact.\nWe endeavor to create business and community impact by identifying innovative and high-quality programs that\nare aligned to our business, providing focused financial and human support, including employee volunteering\nprograms and client participation, where appropriate. These programs are delivered through local execution and\npartnerships operating under a global framework with coordination across regions.\nEmployee volunteering\nOur well-established employee volunteering model has been adapted to meet the needs of our new hybrid ways\nof working, with both face-to-face and virtual opportunities to support our local communities. We have global\ntargets for employee engagement through volunteering, which are built bottom-up and on a best-efforts basis. In\n2023, we successfully engaged 38% of our global workforce in volunteering, and 45% of the 199,633 volunteer\nhours were skills-based.\n7 Lower cash contributions compared to previous years are due to the decision to exclude business-related contributions since these are donations made outside\nof UBS’s strategic Social Impact strategy and do not support the longer-term impact we are striving to achieve with our strategic grantee and volunteering\npartners.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5566\nRespecting human rights\nWe are committed to respecting and promoting human rights, as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business\nand Human Rights. As human rights standards are embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\nrespecting human rights is a key consideration in our business practices. When assessing our potential human rights\nimpacts, we focus on three key stakeholder groups (employees, clients and vendors), as well as society at large.\n› Refer to “Supporting our strategy through stakeholder engagement” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group\nSustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about our\ninteractions with other stakeholders, including civil society groups\nEmployees: We are committed to respecting human rights standards through our human resources policies and\npractices, and to meeting the obligations that a responsible company is required to comply with. These are reviewed\non a regular basis in an effort to make sure we continue to respect human and labor rights.\n› Refer to the “People and culture make the difference” section above and to the Supplement to this report,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about UBS’s human resources policies and\npractices\nClients: We aim to provide our clients with innovative investment solutions on themes related to human rights, such\nas health, education, gender and/or equality. In addition, we take human rights risks into account in solutions that\naddress a broader range of sustainability issues. We identify and manage actual and potential adverse impacts on\nhuman rights to which our clients’ assets and our own assets are exposed, most notably through our sustainability\n(including human rights) and climate risk policy framework.\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more details about our approach to sustainable\nfinance and investing and to the Supplement to this report, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more\ninformation about the sustainability and climate risk policy framework\nVendors: We are committed to reducing the negative societal impacts of the goods and services UBS purchases.\nThat is why, when we are establishing new contracts or renewals, we identify high-risk vendors based on whether\nthey provide goods and services that either have a substantial social impact, or are sourced in markets with\npotentially high social risks. Vendors that do not meet the minimum applicable standard, because they are\nassociated with actual and potential human rights risks, have to agree to and comply with a remediation plan\nbefore signing a contract with us.\n› Refer to the “Managing our supply chain responsibly” section below for more details about our responsible supply-\nchain management\nOur human-rights-related commitments and actions are set out in our Human Rights Statement. The statement\nshows the structures (governance and policies) and mechanisms (procedures and processes) UBS has in place to\nsupport its commitments. UBS also publishes a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement pursuant to the\nUK 2015 Modern Slavery Act and to the Australian 2018 Modern Slavery Act.\n› Refer to our Human Rights Statement and our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, available at\nubs.com/sustainability-reporting\n› Refer to the Supplement to this report, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about\n“UBS Group’s approach to the Swiss Ordinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in relation to Minerals and\nMetals from Conflict-Affected Areas and Child Labor”\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5577\nManaging our supply chain responsibly\nWe embed environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards into our sourcing and procurement activities. The\nResponsible Supply Chain Management (RSCM) framework for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse is based on\nidentifying, assessing and monitoring vendor practices in the areas of human and labor rights, the environment,\nnature, health and safety, and anti-corruption. Central to our RSCM framework are our Responsible Supply Chain\nStandards (RSCS), to which our direct vendors are bound by contract. The RSCS define our expectations toward\nvendors and their subcontractors regarding legal compliance, environmental protection, avoidance of child and\nforced labor, non-discrimination, diversity, equity and inclusion, remuneration, hours of work, freedom of\nassociation, humane treatment, health and safety, anti-corruption measures, and whistleblowing protection for\nemployees. In 2023, the Credit Suisse Third-Party Risk Management due diligence approach continued to manage\nreputational risk from an ESG perspective for Credit Suisse AG. To ensure a consistent and high standard of\nreputational risk coverage across the combined organization, the RSCM framework will be rolled out to Credit\nSuisse in 2024.\n› Refer to ubs.com/suppliers for the RSCS\nIdentifying, assessing and monitoring high-impact vendors\nIn 2023, 100% of new vendors were screened for environmental and social risk. In addition, for UBS Group\nexcluding Credit Suisse, we identify high-impact vendors when establishing new contracts or renewals based on\nwhether the vendors are providing goods and services that could either have a substantial environmental and social\nimpact or be sourced in markets with potentially high social or governance risks. Such high-impact vendors are\nassessed against our RSCS. These vendors are required to provide disclosures about their management practices\nand corresponding evidence that is evaluated by a specialist team. Actual and potential negative impacts that are\nconsidered in the impact assessment of purchased goods and services include, but are not limited to, the following:\n– adverse environmental impacts due to inefficient use of resources (e.g., water and energy), poor environmental\npractices and emissions during the life cycle of a product;\n– hazardous substances, emissions, pollutants and the limited recyclability of products that adversely affect people,\nnature and the environment;\n– modern slavery, forced labor or child labor;\n– unfair employment practices, such as low wages, excessive overtime and the absence of occupational health and\nsafety measures;\n– anti-corruption; and\n– insufficient management of subcontractors and suppliers regarding sustainability aspects.\nIf our assessment reveals any non-compliance with our standards, we define and agree (together with the vendor)\nspecific improvement measures, and closely monitor the implementation progress of these remediation actions.\nLack of improvement may lead to the termination of the vendor relationship. Vendors are reassessed after\n24 months to ensure that, even in long-term contracts, UBS’s expectations regarding environmental and social\naspects are being met and continuously supervised. We also regularly screen active vendors as part of our\nsustainability and climate risk control processes.\nHigh-impact vendors go through assessments against UBS’s RSCS. We also undertake assessments on some non-\nhigh-impact vendors where we have significant ongoing relationships. In 2023, for UBS Group excluding Credit\nSuisse, we carried out risk-based due diligence assessments on 266 vendors of newly sourced contracts, renewals\nand ongoing contracts. To drive positive change in our supply chain, we also require our vendors to improve their\nmanagement practices in line with our sustainability goals and industry best practices. Of the vendors assessed for\nUBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, 42% were considered in need of improving their management practices.\nSpecific remediation actions were agreed upon and implementation progress is being closely monitored.\nAdditionally in 2023, for Credit Suisse, 15 vendors were assessed against Credit Suisse’s environmental and social\nstandards. No actual significant ESG risk was identified with any of the vendors that were assessed for both UBS\nGroup excluding Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse. We have an overall assessment coverage of 20% of vendors by\nspend for UBS.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5588\nContracts in high-risk countries include specific contractual requirements relating to environmental management,\nhuman rights, labor rights and anti-corruption. If we were to become aware of a case of modern slavery or human\ntrafficking occurring within our direct supply chain, we would address it through our governance processes.\nDepending on the severity of the case, or if satisfactory remediation is not possible, the supplier relationship may\nultimately be terminated.\nIn 2023, none of our vendor relationships were terminated as a result of our assessments and no human rights\nissues with active vendors were identified or reported. In part, this was due to having carried out our assessment\nprocess prior to the signing of contracts.\nEmbedding supplier sustainability in our everyday activities\nThe goods and services we buy, how we buy them, from where and from whom are all crucial elements of our\nsustainability impact. We are committed to making a positive environmental and social impact, and we expect the\nsame from our suppliers. Our procurement policy includes taking account of the lower ESG impact of\nproducts/services when selecting a vendor. Within the policy, we have also included mandated minimum weighting\nfor ESG criteria in our tenders, as part of vendor evaluation and selection. This ensures that we award business to\nvendors with strong ESG performance and incentivize vendors who want to work with us to show commitment\nand improvement in these areas. This approach will be extended to Credit Suisse in 2024.\nWe care about our vendors’ ESG performance and want to work with vendors that have strong ESG credentials,\ndrive positive environmental and social impact, and are transparent about their climate disclosures. We leverage\nESG market data which gives us deeper insight into our vendors’ ESG performance and encourages them to\ncontinuously improve their practices. In 2023, 90% of spend in deals >USD 1 million were signed with vendors\nhaving an adequately high ESG performance.\n› Refer to the “Climate-related methodologies” in the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023,\navailable at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more for details on the methodology applied\nWe have also been reviewing our purchasing catalogues to reduce the number of items and move to sustainable\nproducts wherever possible. This year, we focused on driving responsible consumption and removed 444 items\n(67%) from our office supplies catalogues. This approach will also be applied to Credit Suisse in 2024 and 2025.\nWe expect our suppliers to uphold high standards of ethics, mitigate risks, and honor global and local labor laws,\nhuman rights and environmental responsibilities. Suppliers are required to follow our global supplier policies which\ninclude a policy on anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions, fraud, and anti-facilitation of tax evasion.\n› Refer to our “Supplier Code of Conduct,” available at ubs.com/suppliers\n› Refer to our “Global Supplier Policies,” available at ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/suppliers/contracting-standards\n› Refer to the “Monitoring the environmental impact of our supply chain” section of this report on the reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain\nInclusive growth in the supply chain\nIn 2023, we extended our efforts globally to support inclusive growth in the use of diverse suppliers that are\ncertified/recognized by a local/national government authority or advocacy organization. These include, but are not\nlimited to, minority-owned (including aboriginal-owned and indigenous-owned), women-owned, veteran-owned,\ndisabled-owned, and LGBTQ-owned, as well as disadvantaged-owned and small businesses. We actively identify\nand include diverse vendors as part of our “rule of one” guidance, which aims to include at least one diverse\nsupplier in every competitive tender. Globally, our diverse spend accounts for 8.5% of third-party spend.\nWe are members of diverse supplier advocacy organizations which give us insights into diverse supplier markets\nacross the globe, as well as supporting supplier outreach efforts and opportunity matching.\n› Refer to “Supplier Diversity” at ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/suppliers/supplier-diversity\n› Refer to “Supporting our strategic goals – our engagement in partnerships” section of the Supplement to the UBS\nGroup Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information on our\nsustainability- and impact-related memberships\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 5599\nLeveraging partnerships to help suppliers build capability\nRecognizing the role small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play in fostering positive change across our supply\nchain, we have partnered with Heart of the City, a UK charity dedicated to supporting SMEs on their journey toward\nsustainability. Through a series of workshops, masterclasses and webinars, the charity empowers small and diverse\nbusiness owners in the UK to navigate their sustainability journeys effectively. Not only do these activities help drive\nsustainability beyond our immediate supply chain, they also support the communities in which we operate.\nWe are also partnering with the United Nations Global Compact. This year, we invited Swiss SME suppliers to\nparticipate in a series of six sessions organized by the UNGC Network Switzerland on sustainability topics, including\nclimate action, environmental stewardship, human and labor rights. These sessions offer our vendors opportunities\nto exchange insights, acquire knowledge, and address challenges related to sustainability. Building their knowledge\nand sustainability capabilities helps to support our sustainability goals through improved vendor compliance,\nreduces risks from environmental or ethical issues and builds commitment toward shared sustainability objectives.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Social 6600\nGroup\nSupporting opportunities\nTotal Sustainable Investments The SI proportion of UBS In the Investment Bank UBS Group retained our\n(SI) of UBS AG reached USD AG total invested assets we facilitated\n1\n292 reached 102 st\nrank position in\n6.5\nbillion %\nSwiss franc-denominated\nrepresenting an increase of green, social, sustainability, GSSS bond issuance in\n10% year on year1 or sustainability-linked (GSSS) our home market of\nbond transactions globally2 Switzerland, with a 50%\nmarket share3\nUBS Group is the\n2\nnd\nlargest manager of open-ended funds and ETFs by SI invested assets using Morningstar’s classifi cation4\n1 UBS AG Sustainable Investing invested assets (IA).

For 2024 it is our intention to\nfully incorporate Credit Suisse data into our disclosures.\nOur sustainable finance ambitions\nFinance has an important role to play as companies and individuals consider how best to approach the transition\nto a more sustainable, lower-carbon world. At the same time, the regulatory environment continues to evolve, as\ndo the associated capital-raising and investment opportunities. Against this backdrop, we are committed to\nsupporting our clients’ sustainability ambitions, whether their focus is on reducing the carbon emissions footprint\nof their business or portfolio, or encouraging a fairer and more prosperous society.\nThrough our sustainable finance product and service offerings, we target four key objectives in serving our clients:\n– The power of choice: we want to give our investing clients the choices they need to meet their specific\nsustainability objectives.\n– An orderly transition: we aim to support our clients through the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy, for\ninstance, by offering innovative sustainable financing and investment solutions.\n– Managing risks and identifying opportunities: we offer research and thematic insights, as well as data and\nanalytics services. Combined with targeted advice, these are designed to help clients better understand and\nmitigate risks and identify new opportunities.\n– Making sustainable finance an everyday topic: we want to make sustainability topics tangible throughout our\ninteractions with clients. To help us do that, we provide support in the form of tools, platforms, and education.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6611\nSustainable fi nance ambitions\nIn accordance with our ambitions, our sustainable\nfi nance product offering is evolving across four areas:\nInvesting Financing Research and advisory Data, platforms and\nclient Interactions\nSustainable investing Sustainable fi nancing Solutions guiding our\nsolutions for private and solutions for real estate clients on their sustainability ESG analytics, scoring, reporting,\ninstitutional investors and corporate purposes transition journey tools and client support through\nour interactions\nOur approach to sustainable finance\nIt is important to set out how we define sustainable finance, as no uniformly accepted definition currently exists in\nthe industry. We consider sustainable finance to include any financial product or service (including both investing\nand financing solutions) that aims to explicitly align with and/or contribute to sustainability-related objectives, while\ntargeting market-rate risk-adjusted financial returns. Sustainability-related objectives may include, but are not\nlimited to, the Sustainable Development Goals identified in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThis approach to sustainable finance is also reflected in our UBS AG sustainable investing framework, which\nspecifically defines “sustainability focus” and “impact investing” strategies. Both categories reflect a defined and\nexplicit sustainability intention of the underlying investment strategy. This intentionality differentiates them from\ntraditional investment products, or those that consider sustainability-related aspects but do not actively and explicitly\npursue any specific sustainability objective, such as ESG integration or exclusions-only approaches. The way we\ndefine sustainable investments is reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis in order to ensure that it appropriately\nconsiders evolving market practice, client expectations and relevant regulatory guidance.\nInvestment approaches\nUBS’s definition of sustainable investments\nTraditional investing Sustainability focus Impact investing\n– No explicit sustainability objectives – Target market-rate investment – Target market-rate investment\nreturns returns\n– Manage sustainability and all risks\nrelated to investment performance – Have explicit sustainable intentions – Have explicit intentions to generate\nor objectives that drive the strategy measurable, verifi able, positive\n– May use ESG tools, but these do\nsustainability outcomes\nnot drive the strategy – Underlying investments may\ncontribute to positive sustainability – Impact attributable to investor\noutcomes through products, action and / or contribution\nservices and / or proceeds\n› Refer to the Supplement to this report, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more on ESG integration\nand exclusion\n› Refer to the ”Sustainability and climate risk policy framework“ or “Key terms and definitions” section of the\nSupplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting for our\ndefinitions of sustainable bonds and loans\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6622\nMarket developments in 2023\n2023 was dominated by persistently high inflation and interest rates across many key jurisdictions, correspondingly\nhigh energy prices and significant geopolitical volatility and uncertainty. These challenges also negatively\ncontributed to tensions associated with sustainability-related industries and political discussions. Notwithstanding\nthese challenges and tensions, sustainable finance business opportunities continued to broaden and deepen.\nInterest in sustainable investing (SI) and financing solutions continued to be robust. This was bolstered by major\nlegislative initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the European Union’s Green\nDeal Industrial Plan, as well as various ongoing regulatory initiatives.\nAt the same time, investors, corporations, and regulators have continued to pay close attention to greenwashing\nrisks. Sustainable product frameworks have evolved, and it is widely expected that standards will be subject to\nfurther amendments, given that certain frameworks are still under review and subject to further development or in\nthe early stages of implementation (e.g., the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the UK Sustainability\nDisclosure Regulation).\nThroughout the year investors took advantage of higher interest rates by moving to income-producing asset classes\nand money market products, with the latter attracting over USD 1.1 trillion1 in net inflows. Increased investor\nappetite for fixed income products was accompanied by corresponding outflows from equity funds.\nInvestor appetite for sustainability-oriented funds and ETFs continued. Once again, after 2022 and 2021, inflows\ninto sustainable investment funds in 2023 outpaced those into their non-SI counterparts, albeit at more modest\nlevels compared to the highs seen in 2021. Throughout the year, investors expanded their sustainable investment\nallocations into alternative asset classes, including hedge funds, real estate or infrastructure.\nThis was also reflected in our clients continued interest in SI solutions. Over the course of 2023, UBS AG’s SI invested\nassets rose to USD 292.3 billion as of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 266 billion at the end of 2022,\nrepresenting a year-on-year increase of 10%. A combination of factors contributed to this growth, including new\nproduct launches, net new money inflows as well as market performance. SI invested assets accounted for 6.5%\nof UBS’s total invested assets at year-end 2023.\nWe expect the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group to provide UBS with additional sustainability-focused assets\nand clients, a wider selection of products and services and even greater in-house expertise. However, there are\nareas of variance between the two organizations’ reporting and product standards that we are actively working to\nanalyze and harmonize. UBS sustainable product standards will be the benchmark going forward, with Credit\nSuisse’s sustainable financing and investment products undergoing a detailed assessment to ensure compliance\nwith our standards, frameworks and expectations.\nThe table below provides additional detail on SI invested assets for UBS AG. As stated before, this table and section\ndo not contain any values related to Credit Suisse sustainable investment products.\n› Refer to the “Appendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit Suisse AG” in the appendices to this report for more\ninformation about the Credit Suisse Sustainable Investment Framework (SIF)\nSustainable Investments1\nFor the year ended % change from\nUSD billion, except where indicated 31.12.23 31.12.22 31.12.21 31.12.22\nTotal invested assets (UBS Group) 5,714.1 3,980.9 4,614.5 44\nof which: total invested assets (UBS AG) 4,504.7 3,980.9 4,614.5 13\nSustainable investments (UBS AG)2\nSustainability focus3 270.4 246.9 222.7 10\nImpact investing4 21.8 19.2 28.1 14\nTotal sustainable investments5,6,7 292.3 266.0 250.8 10\nSI proportion of total invested assets (%)8 6.5 6.7 5.4\n1 The table above details UBS AG Sustainable Investing Invested Assets (IA) and the evolution thereof.

Underlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products / services / use of proceeds.\n4 Strategies that have explicit intentions of generating measurable, verifiable and positive sustainability outcomes. Impact generated is attributable to investor action and/or contributions.\n5 Certain products have been reclassified during 2023 for reasons including, but not limited to, an evolving regulatory environment, periodic monitoring of the product shelf, and\ndeveloping internal classification standards. Impact of these movements on sustainable investment invested assets was a net reduction by USD 7 billion in UBS AG Global Wealth\nManagement Americas and a net reduction by USD 6 billion in UBS AG Asset Management. 6 In line with general market practice, IA reported for sustainable investments include\nlimited amounts of instruments not classified as sustainable investment, including cash and cash-like instruments that each fund and portfolio hold for liquidity management purposes,\nas well as, subject to clear, limiting restrictions, client-directed investments included in sustainable investing mandates managed by UBS Asset Management. 7 The impact investing\nand total sustainable investments (UBS AG) disclosures for 31.12.22 and 31.12.21 reporting periods have been restated to remove investments that were duplicated in the disclosed\nvalues. As a result, the values disclosed for 31.12.22 and 31.12.21 for both categories have each decreased by USD 1.6 billion and USD 0.4 billion, respectively. 8 Total invested assets\n(UBS AG) are used to calculate the SI proportion.\n1 Morningstar\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6633\nFollowing a year of subdued debt market issuance activity in 2022, green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-\nlinked (GSSS) bond supply rebounded in 2023, rising 7% year-on-year (YoY).2 The growth was driven by bonds\nwith green (+15% YoY) and sustainability (+7% YoY) labels. We saw banks and corporate issuers favoring green\nbonds, while sovereign, supranational and agency (SSAs) issuers primarily opted for the latter, given a broader mix\nof green and social assets. Sustainability-linked issuance dropped 25% year-on-year driven by heightened market\nscrutiny around the materiality and ambition of the key performance indicators (KPIs) used, compounded by SLB\nissuers failing to reach their annual targets. Regionally, EMEA issuers accounted for 52% of 2023 FY global supply,\nwhile APAC issuers were responsible for 29%. In line with the overall GSSS bond market dynamics, the number of\ntransactions facilitated by the Investment Bank in 2023 increased to 102.3\nLooking ahead\nDespite another relatively challenging and turbulent year for markets, we believe the strong market growth of\nsustainable investing and financing products in recent years and a general increase in investor demand for\ninnovative sustainable finance solutions indicates clients’ ongoing desire to pursue sustainability-related objectives.\nThat, in turn, is encouraging a greater level of active investor ownership, with rising levels of corporate engagement\nand system-wide advocacy.\nThe ongoing relevance of sustainability for institutional investors and senior management of the world’s largest\ncompanies was once again evidenced by a 2023 Bloomberg Intelligence survey of C-suite executives and senior\ninstitutional investor representatives4. All told, 85% of investors surveyed believe that incorporating ESG in their\ninvestments leads to better returns, more resilient portfolios and enhanced fundamental analysis, while 84% of\nsurveyed executives said ESG helps them shape a more robust corporate strategy. These are strongly supportive\nresults which confirm our belief that incorporating sustainability-related considerations is ultimately good business\npractice and will continue to inform business leaders’ forward thinking and planning.\nAdditionally, our own 2023 UBS AG Asset Management client survey showed 74% of clients expect to increase\ntheir allocation to sustainable investments over the next five years. The survey results also show an encouraging\ngrowth in satisfaction with the way in which we are increasing exposure to sustainable investments within the\nvarious asset classes.\nAt the same time, high net worth individuals (HNWI) appear to have become more selective about how they grow\ntheir sustainable investments, after having done so quite aggressively in 2022. A 2023 Global Wealth Manager\nInvestment Survey by Mercer5 noted that 34% of respondents said their clients want to grow their exposure to\nsustainable investments, while another 34% wanted to keep it at the same level. This followed 80% of respondents\nto the 2022 survey having reported rising client demand for sustainable investments.\nMeeting diverse needs\nThere is no typical UBS client. Each one has varying needs, but all expect outstanding advice and service, a wide\nrange of product choices, and an excellent client experience.\nOur clients span ultra high and high net worth individuals, families and family offices worldwide, affluent clients in\nselected markets, and an array of corporate, institutional, private, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as\nretail clients in Switzerland.\nWe work hard to service our clients’ diverse sustainable financing, investing and/or advisory needs in the best way\npossible, leveraging the knowledge of our specialist teams. An established rationale guides our interactions with\nclients, and it starts by building an understanding of the relevance of sustainability for their business and/or\ninvestment portfolio.\nThe following graphic provides an overview of sustainable finance products and services offered by UBS.

We\ndo this via an end-to-end research-driven investment value chain. The starting point is\nGWM\ndedicated sustainability-focused investment research, including strategic asset allocation,\nthematic and asset-class views. These then translate into high-conviction instrument\nselection and advice.\nThis approach aims to provide insights for clients about sustainability risks and opportunities and how to consider\nthem within a portfolio context. These research views inform our sustainable and impact investing solutions, which\ninclude multi-asset investment portfolios and a suite of advisory options across equities, bonds, and alternative\ninvestments.\nIntegration of Credit Suisse\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse Group offers Global Wealth Management several discrete opportunities to enhance\nour existing sustainable investing offering with potentially complementary capabilities and resources. These\nopportunities include enhancement of transparency and reporting on the sustainability characteristics of\ninvestments and portfolios; as well as the addition of more subject-matter experts who bring a focus on client\nengagement and internal capacity building. We also look forward to bringing select Credit Suisse sustainable and\nimpact investing solutions onto the merged platform during 2024 and 2025.

We publish a regular series of sustainable investment views,\nincluding a monthly Sustainable Investing Perspectives series and a longer-term-focused quarterly Sustainable\nInSights publication. They are complemented by the Sustainable Investing in Charts and SI Top Holdings reports,\nboth introduced during 2023.\nThe underlying sustainable investing research views are integrated into the CIO House View and are accompanied,\nwhere relevant, by media such as videos or podcasts, to facilitate client reach and accessibility. A spectrum of topics\nwas covered during 2023, including impact investing, green-tech, opportunities arising from public capital programs,\ncarbon markets and the circular economy. In addition, we introduced a framework to help investors gain exposure to\nsecuritized assets with a focus on sustainability, including mortgage-backed securities. We expect this area to provide\nmore opportunities for innovation as investors increase their focus on sub-asset classes within fixed income.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6666\nWe also continued to include sustainable investing insights in the CIO monthly Messages in Focus publication,\nwhich provides private clients with tactical, actionable investment ideas. Additionally, the flagship CIO 2024 Year\nAhead publication outlined investment implications for sustainable investors in the year to come and discussed the\nimpact of decarbonization over the coming decade.\nWe further enhanced the methodology underpinning the CIO Sustainability Scores for issuers, which now covers\napproximately 13,000 issuers and enables issuer-, fund-, and portfolio-level transparency to be delivered to clients.\nEducating our clients and their advisors\nSupporting our clients, prospects and advisors with timely research and education on sustainable investing is an\nimportant part of the advice we provide. Given the rapidly evolving environment around sustainability and\ninvestments, it is crucial for advisors to stay up-to-date on industry trends, regulatory developments and investment\nideas. During 2023, we delivered a range of voluntary learning opportunities at various client events, including the\nAPAC flagship sustainable finance conferences (which attracted more than 600 APAC clients), the Emerging\nSuccessors Program, Own Your Worth Sustainability Summit, and the UBS x Unlocked Foundation Women’s\nSummits. To complement these events, we also introduced additional sustainability-focused training opportunities\nfor advisors globally. These ranged from mandatory training modules to a series of virtual discussions with internal\nand external subject-matter experts on topics like ESG politicization and investing in oceans.\n› Refer to ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/sustainable-investing for more information about our Global\nWealth Management’s sustainable investing insights\n› Refer to the UBS Group Annual Report 2023 available on ubs.com/annualreport for more information on the overall\nbusiness and financial profile of UBS Global Wealth Management as important context for the product and\nfinancial information provided here\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more information on the proportion of\nsustainable investment assets as part of UBS Group’s total invested assets\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6677\nAM1\nAsset Management\nSustainable Investing (SI) has been an integral part of our Asset Management business for\nover 20 years, grounded in the clear belief that, from our products and services to the way\nwe work and operate in society, sustainability means thinking and acting with the long\nterm in mind. The array of sustainable investment (SI) strategies we offer aims to drive\nAM2\nfinancial returns and sustainability outcomes.\nIntegration of Credit Suisse\nIn our combined organization, there is a continued focus on sustainability and innovation. We believe the\nintegration brings opportunities for an expanded client offering and a more influential “seat at the table” for\nstewardship and engagement activities, given our increased asset base.\nThe existing UBS AG Asset Management SI product classification framework will remain in place and will be applied\nto the Asset Management (Credit Suisse) products when onboarded to the UBS shelf, starting in 2024. Separate\ngovernance structures remain in place as of end 2023, while, concurrently, progress has been made to align policies,\nmethodologies and frameworks. A joint governance forum has been put in place to support this alignment.\n2023 highlights\nAt the end of 2023 UBS AG Asset At the end of 2023 UBS AG\nManagement managed Sustainable Asset management had\nFocus and Impact Investing assets of USD\n35\n203\nbillion net-zero ambition portfolios\navailable for our clients\nActive Ownership\nAsset Management corporate Asset Management actively Asset Management conducted\nengagements on ESG topics achieved engaged with\n536\n56.5% 373\nengagement meetings on ESG\npositive progress against companies on ESG topics\ntopics with investee companies\nstated objectives\nWe are convinced that taking a focused, investment-led and outcomes-driven approach to active ownership brings\nbenefits to companies, their shareholders, and wider society. Effective engagement can help companies contribute\nto value creation and protection at the company-specific and systemic levels, addressing both risks and\nopportunities.\nClimate\nUBS AG Asset Management has been running a Climate Engagement Program for more than five years. In 2023,\nwe sharpened the program’s focus on engaging with companies to adopt targets and transition planning in line\nwith a net-zero pathway and increased the number of companies covered by the program. In addition to our direct\nengagement, we continued to use collaborative initiatives to scale our impact, especially through our membership\nof Climate Action 100+.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6688\nWe believe we can support industry leaders in accelerating the early adoption of transformative decarbonization\ntechnologies. By way of example, in September 2023, we hosted an engagement event designed to accelerate\ndecarbonization in the shipping sector. Cargo owners, commodity shippers, marine engine manufacturers and low-\ncarbon fuel providers, as well as recognized experts, used the event to discuss key barriers to alternative fuels, such\nas supply, technical complexities, and pricing. The event supported one of the main objectives of our Climate Action\nfund. Launched in December 2022, the fund invests in attractively valued companies in emission-intensive industries\nthat need to decarbonize over time. We actively engage with these companies one-on-one, and across the value\nchain, to monitor and support such efforts.\nWe also engage with companies to set climate targets in line with net-zero pathways, which we see as critical for\ncredible climate risk management and achieving the transition to a low-carbon economy. We were a signatory to\na campaign led by the Carbon Disclosure Project, encouraging over 2,000 companies to adopt science-based\nclimate targets. We were also co-signatories to two investor-led letters to policymakers, calling on them to\naccelerate decarbonization goals at state-owned companies.\nLinking our climate engagement with voting action is key to ensuring a continued clear alignment across our active\nownership approach. To support this, we have aligned our voting policy with our climate engagement efforts and\nobjectives in our policy framework and clarified our climate and net-zero expectations of companies. We have a\nclearly defined set of criteria which we use to evaluate companies’ say-on-climate proposals.\nWe will further evaluate climate proposals against the following six key factors: climate governance, net-zero\nambition and targets, quality of decarbonization strategy, net-zero performance alignment, lobbying and policy\nengagement, and use of offsets. We will also support shareholder proposals that seek information about issuers\nadopting or adhering to relevant norms, standards, codes of conduct or universally recognized international\ninitiatives, including the recommendations of the TCFD.\nWe have a fiduciary duty and fundamental objective to act in the best financial interests of our clients to enhance\nthe long-term value of their investments. We exercise our voting rights in a manner which we believe is in the\ncompanies’ long-term financial interests.\nNature\nTo support our increasing focus on natural capital, Asset Management became a founding member of the Nature\nAction 100 collaborative engagement initiative and joined the Principles for Responsible Investment’s Advisory\nCommittee for its stewardship initiative on nature.\nSocial\nIn 2023, we progressed against the engagement objectives of our Social Engagement Program, which launched a\nyear earlier. Our three focus themes are human capital, human rights and health. To complement our direct\nengagement efforts, we continued to collaborate with other investors to maximize our engagement impact.\nWe have seen target engagement companies enhance their labor practices, set time-bound quantitative targets to\nenhance gender diversity, conduct human rights risk assessments, and initiate plans to reduce risks and raise their\nfocus on societal health. We also filed a shareholder resolution, urging a company to enhance gender diversity at\nboard level after several years of stewardship activities led to no signs of progress.\nIn addition, we took up the role of Chair of the global engagement workstream in the UK Chapter of the 30%\nClub and we also co-chair the Investors in Nutrition and Health initiative of the Access to Nutrition Initiative. These\nroles allow us to drive industry collaboration and enhance our effectiveness in reaching engagement outcomes.\nCredit Suisse AG Asset Management collaborated with other asset managers to establish social and human capital\nkey performance indicators for funds with a social objective in the industry, to build financially and socially important\ndata such as human capital turnover at the levels of gender, ethnicity, and age group.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Supporting opportunities 6699\nThought leadership research\nAsset Management launched a special Sustainable Investing edition of its Panorama series during 2023. The\npublication focused on the opportunities and risks of sustainable investing, enhancing the effectiveness of\nstewardship by asset owners and asset managers, showing how to customize sustainability through active and\nindex investing, and the role that natural capital plays in sustainability investing approaches.\nDuring 2023, we also published several thought leadership pieces, including articles focused on natural capital,\nchemical pollution, embodied carbon, physical risk, impact investing and active ownership. They included:\n– Chemical pollution and the need to transition to sustainable chemistry;\n– No false starts: The race to reduce embodied carbon;\n– China and net zero; A recipe for alpha?;\n– Finding our voice: Active owners need to bring something to the table; and\n– Green premium.\nWe also conducted extensive thematic research on emerging sustainability topics such as biodiversity, to facilitate\nengagement activities and portfolio investment decision-making.\nExternal awards recognition\nUBS AG Asset Management won several sustainability-themed awards during 2023, underlining the strengths of\nour approach. Highlights include:\n– Top 5 Fastest Riser for ESG at the Broadridge Distribution Achievement Awards;\n– Best ESG Fund House (Passive) and Best ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund (Passive) at the ESG Clarity Awards;\n– Best Equity ESG Investment Fund at the ESG Investment Leader Awards 2023 for the Global Equity Climate\nTransition Fund; and\n– Strong results in the 2023 GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments, with all 20 discretionary strategies\nachieving 4 or 5 stars and outperforming the GRESB average, 14 of them receiving 5 stars and four of the\nstrategies being ranked first in their peer group.1\n› Refer to the UBS Group Annual Report 2023 available on ubs.com/annualreport for more information on the overall\nbusiness and financial profile of UBS AG Asset Management as important context for the product and financial\ninformation provided here\n› Refer to the “Supporting opportunities” section of this report for more information on the proportion of\nsustainable investment assets as part of UBS Group’s total invested assets\n1 GRESB is a third-party organization that provides ESG data to financial markets.

More generally, through our\nresearch, we addressed ways in which ESG factors connect to individual markets, sectors and companies in our\ncoverage, for example in an expanded ESG Sector and Company Radar product.\nESG research is supported by the UBS Evidence Lab. It provides data-driven insights into ESG-relevant questions and\nin 2023, it identified six themes favored by family offices for impact investing: education; climate change;\nhealthcare; economic development and poverty alleviation; agriculture; and a broad theme covering alternative\nfood sources, clean water, and sanitation.\nSustainable finance at conferences and other events\nThroughout the global calendar, ESG and sustainability-related topics are frequently integrated into proprietary\ninvestor conferences run by the Investment Bank, and into other industry events. These include targeted events\nfocusing on sustainable finance topics such as transition finance, regulatory developments, impact technology and\ngreen equity.\nWe also incorporate sustainability topics into sector- or market-specific conferences including our Energy Transition\nConference, Global Real Estate CEO/CFO Forum and our Greater China Conference.

A recent Bloomberg Intelligence-run survey\nof senior corporate executives confirmed this trend.1 As pressure from regulators and other key stakeholders, such\nas customers, investors and employees, grows, so too does the need for transformation. The ESG Advisory Group\nsupports UBS’s clients in assessing ESG topics throughout the corporate lifecycle.\nOur approach is underpinned by a profiling framework with carefully developed modules to critically analyze a\ncorporation’s ESG profile from a business and investor perspective. The framework lies at the heart of all Global\nBanking transactions and addresses four core components (with examples of analytical modules in parentheses):\n– what you do (stakeholder engagement framework);\n– how you do it (ESG performance analysis, PAI2 as a product explaining investor needs to corporates);\n– how you talk about it (corporate sustainability report diagnostics); and\n– what others say about you (outside-in stakeholder analysis via artificial intelligence (AI) platform).\nLeveraged and debt capital markets\nThe Investment Bank arranged USD 53.7 billion3 in green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS)\nbonds through 102 bond deals during 20234. Our deal activity was particularly strong in EMEA and Australia while\nalso solidifying our market-leading position in the Swiss-franc-denominated market with the Investment Bank’s\nmarket share at nearly 50%5. In addition, we have built a strong position in Brazil’s local labelled ESG debt market.\nDeal highlights included the structuring and execution of the Western Australia Treasury Corporation’s (WATC)\ninaugural AUD 1.9 billion green deal, and winning the structuring mandate for the Australian government. The\nfunds for WATC will support government projects targeting environmental outcomes, such as investments to\ndecarbonize the main electricity grid. This includes batteries and wind farms, EV charging infrastructures as well as\nrebates and standalone power systems. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Australian government’s green bond\nframework highlights its key priorities, by referencing its aim for upcoming green bonds to finance projects that\nwill help Australia achieve its ambition to be net zero by 2050.\nIn July 2023, we acted as a joint global coordinator, physical bookrunner and sustainability coordinator on a debut\nEUR 270 million green senior secured notes issuance in support of the leveraged buy-out (LBO) of Amara Nzero by\na consortium led by Cinven. This was the first green bond to be issued in EMEA with LBO use of proceeds. In August\n2023, we facilitated an innovative senior non-preferred sustainability-linked loan (SLL) note from Nordea.

Lombard lending rating is assigned based on the average riskiness of loans. 2 Metrics are calculated and restated based\non the 2023 methodology, across three years of reporting, 2021–2023. 3 As defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD), in its expanded definition\npublished in 2021, UBS defines carbon-related assets through industry-identifying attributes of the firm’s banking book. UBS further includes the four non-financial sectors addressed\nby the TCFD, including, but not limited to, fossil fuel extraction, carbon-based power generation, transportation (air, sea, rail, and auto manufacture), metals production and mining,\nmanufacturing industries, real estate development, chemicals, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, building and construction materials and activities, forestry, agriculture, fishing, food\nand beverage production, as well as including trading companies that may trade any of the above (e.g., oil trading or agricultural commodity trading companies). This metric is agnostic\nof risk rating, and therefore may include exposures of companies that may be already transitioning or adapting their business models to climate risks, unlike UBS climate-sensitive sectors\nmethodology, which takes a risk-based approach to defining material exposure to climate impacts. 4 Total customer lending exposure consists of total loans and advances to customers\nand guarantees, as well as irrevocable loan commitments (within the scope of expected credit loss) and is based on consolidated and standalone IFRS numbers. The credit exposure\nincludes portfolio adjustment bookings, which are either directly impacting the metrics, and have been reflected in the heatmaps, or are impact assessed and immaterial to the metrics\nrepresentation. 5 UBS continues to collaborate to resolve methodological and data challenges, and seeks to integrate both impacts to and dependency on a changing natural and\nclimatic environment, in how it evaluates risks and opportunities. 6 Climate- and nature-related risks are scored between 0 and 1, based on sustainability and climate risk transmission\nchannels, as outlined in the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023. Risk ratings represent a range of scores across five-rating categories: low, moderately low,\nmoderate, moderately high, and high. The climate- or nature-sensitive exposure metrics are determined based upon the top three of the five rated categories: moderate to high. 7\nTraded products are newly disclosed for FY 2023. Risk exposures consist of receivables from securities financial transactions, cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments and\nfinancial assets measured at amortised cost. 8 Issuer Risk is newly disclosed for FY 2023. Risk exposures consist of HQLA assets, debt securities, bonds, liquidity buffer securities. 9\nNature-related risk metric methodology has been further strategically enhanced, as part of an ongoing collaboration between UBS and UNEP-FI.\nThe table below presents a view of UBS’s risk profile and changes year-on-year, within sectors and across climate-\nand nature-related risks. It first shows UBS’s total exposure, and trend, to each sector, followed by an exposure-\nweighted risk rating, the trend in the underlying quantitative score year-on-year, and finally shows the total absolute\nexposure rated as moderate or higher within that sector. This is presented for all three risk types. Exposures may\nappear under one or more of the risk types and therefore may not be added together; this is because the\nmethodologies are distinct in their approach and application.\nOverall, UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse has a moderate or moderately low outlook across the three risk\ncategories at the end of 2023. We found that most year-on-year fluctuations were driven by an increase in lending\nand changes in the risk profile relating to commercial real estate activities, especially in Switzerland. The changes\nin the risk profile can be attributed to regulatory action in Switzerland regarding climate policies.\n› Refer to our transition and physical risk heatmaps above\nSustainability Report

UBS takes comprehensive measures to prevent\nand detect non-compliance with laws and regulations and does not tolerate or facilitate criminal activity or breaches\nof the letter or spirit of applicable laws, regulations, rules and policies designed to prevent such activities.\nUBS does not engage in business activities that pose unacceptably high levels of money laundering, fraud, sanctions\nor corruption risk. Additionally, UBS does not engage in activities that pose risks that cannot be effectively managed\nby the existing control environment. Although it is not possible to eliminate such residual risk entirely, UBS has\nappropriate policies, procedures, controls and processes in place to manage the relevant risks.\nUBS annually assesses the money laundering, fraud, sanctions and bribery and corruption risks associated with all\nof its business operations against its control framework and takes action where appropriate to further mitigate\nthese risks.\nPublic-private partnerships\nWe are a founding member of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of global banks that aims to develop financial\nservices sector standards for the prevention of financial crimes such as money laundering, fraud, corruption and\nterrorist financing, as well as developing industry standards for know-your-client (KYC) due diligence and ongoing\ntransaction monitoring.\nThe Wolfsberg Group brings together banks from around the world at its annual forum and regional out-reach\nmeetings focused on financial crime topics, and delivers an annual academy to support the development of junior\nFinancial Crime Prevention (FCP) officers. It also works on guidance papers in related key areas of financial crime.\nUBS is actively involved with this group. For example, during 2022 we co-chaired the Wolfsberg working group to\nupdate and re-issue its Anti-Bribery & Corruption Programme guidance.\nTogether with the other members of the Wolfsberg Group, we work with the Financial Action Task Force (the\nFATF), an intergovernmental body that helps develop national and international policies on preventing money\nlaundering and terrorist financing through consultation with the private sector.\nIn November 2020, UBS joined the World Economic Forum’s Partnership Against Corruption Initiative (the PACI).\nThe PACI undertakes initiatives to address industry, country, regional, and global issues linked to anti-corruption\nand compliance. We contributed to the PACI’s Gatekeepers in the Fight Against Illicit Financial Flows paper and\nassessed its own framework as being compliant with these standards.\nWe are a member of a number of public-private partnerships operating globally that have been set up to foster\ncloser working relationships between financial institutions and law enforcement, most notably the Joint Money\nLaundering Taskforce operations group in the UK, which has worked on a number of human trafficking and modern\nslavery cases.\nA risk-based approach to combating financial crime\nOnboarding and ongoing monitoring\nUBS performs risk-based initial due diligence on all customers which is designed to establish their identity and\nownership, the nature of their business activities, and the source(s) of their wealth and funds. This includes formal\nprocesses for mitigating the risk of impersonation fraud in circumstances where we are not doing business on a\nface-to-face basis. Where the client represents a potentially elevated risk according to the Group anti-money-\nlaundering (AML) and KYC policy, enhanced due diligence is performed.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 1 | Governance 110000\nUBS does not establish or maintain relationships with parties when the KYC information cannot be sufficiently\nestablished or where UBS has reason to believe the party has or intends to use UBS products or services for illicit\nactivities. UBS does not open accounts for relationships that do not meet our standards or that pose unacceptable\nfinancial crime or reputational risk for the bank.\nAfter a client onboarding is completed, ongoing due diligence and risk screening is performed during the lifecycle\nof the client relationship. Clients are subjected to regular risk rating and client activities and transactions are subject\nto AML transaction monitoring. In addition, ongoing periodic KYC reviews are conducted with varying frequency,\ndriven by the client risk rating.\nOur Group AML & KYC Policy sets out the process and criteria relating to the identification, senior management\nsign-off, periodic review and ongoing monitoring of clients deemed to be Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), as well\nas other customers who have links with jurisdictions or industries that pose elevated levels of financial crime risk.\nWe apply KYC rules and use advanced technology to help identify suspicious transaction patterns and compliance\nrisk issues. We continue to invest in our detection capabilities and core systems as part of our FCP program.\nRed flags must be referred to FCP if any UBS staff become aware of potentially suspicious activities during the client\nlifecycle and this may result in investigation, suspicious activity report filing and/or client exit, as appropriate. We\nadhere to the global FATF standards with respect to record-keeping.\nOur entire financial crime framework is subject to regular controls testing, in both the first and second lines of\ndefense, which includes a cycle of regular peer review testing executed by a designated team within the Group’s\nFCP function. Additionally, our Group Internal Audit team performs a rigorous cycle of independent audit reviews\ncovering the financial crime framework globally and cross-divisionally and we are subject to ongoing supervision by\nregulatory authorities in all the markets in which we operate.\nConduct and culture\nThe UBS Code of Conduct and Ethics (the Code) sets out the principles and commitments that define our ethical\nstandards and the way we do business. The Code commits all UBS employees to do whatever we can to combat\nmoney laundering, fraud, corruption and terrorist financing.\nWe have systems in place and hold ourselves accountable for detecting, stopping and\nreporting money laundering matters, including terrorist financing.\nFor example, we do not tolerate any form of corruption or bribery, including facilitating payments, nor do we offer\nor accept improper gifts or payments.\nAdditionally, the Code requires that UBS employees do not help or advise its clients, or any other party, to evade\ntaxes or misreport taxable income and gains. It also states that we should not contract with third parties who\nprovide services for UBS or on our behalf, where those services help others improperly evade taxes.\nIn 2023, all employees of UBS including its senior management and governance bodies received adequate training\non Financial Crime Prevention matters, which covers AML/KYC, Sanctions, Fraud and Anti-Corruption. New joiners\nmust receive training within 30 days of joining UBS. All staff are required to complete the Global Financial Crime\nPrevention Refresher module on an annual Basis which includes an assessment. The frequency for each training\ncourse is specified by the course owner (one-time, annual, bi-annual). We regularly update web-based training\nmodules to address compliance issues, including financial crime standards, and to incorporate learning from both\ninternal and external events and geopolitical developments. In addition, employees in specific areas receive targeted\ntraining on specific financial crime risks associated with the business lines or activities they are involved with as\nneeded. In 2023, Credit Suisse managed their own mandatory AML training, however, all Credit Suisse staff will\nbe required to complete our mandatory Computer Based Training beginning in 2024.\n› Refer to the Code of Conduct and Ethics of UBS, available at ubs.com/code\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 1 | Governance 110011\nProtecting data\nData is of enormous value to our firm. When treated as a corporate asset, it enables our business to run smoothly.\nIt can also help us to grow and prosper, by giving us the information we need to capture new business or react\nquickly to new trends. As we continue to invest in our digital solutions, we are similarly committed to:\n– developing a robust command and control framework to manage and protect our offering and the petabytes of\ndata that are inherently generated by it;\n– being stewards of data on behalf of our clients and employees; and\n– requesting our third parties adopt equivalent practices and meet our expectations.\nIt is our responsibility to protect data disclosed to us in an increasingly complex and evolving\nenvironment. We have comprehensive measures (relevant controls, processes and policies)\nin place for the protection of personal data.\nWe have also introduced organizational and technical security measures, underpinned by an operational risk and\ncontrol framework, to safeguard personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Access to data\nis protected through control mechanisms following the need-to-know principle and ensuring revocation when no\nlonger required. Where applicable and required, de-identification solutions are used for some specific use cases of\nsensitive client data.\nDespite the complexities involved with the integration of Credit Suisse, we continue to focus on the delivery of our\nservices. This includes operating at the highest possible standards to protect our information assets against threats\nwhile enabling the secure development and deployment of innovative digital solutions.\n› Refer to ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/cybersafe/cyber-security for more information on how UBS safeguards\nbanking data, commercial information and financial assets\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors (the BoD) and the Group Executive Board (the GEB) recognize that cyber- and information-\nsecurity (CIS) capabilities are critical in protecting the firm and fostering an appropriate risk management culture.\nThe BoD Risk Committee and the GEB oversee the CIS program through regular reviews and reporting and are part\nof the escalation chain for major and critical cyber incidents. Additionally, cyber-specific systems and processes are\nsubject to continual review and updates by our internal control teams. The BoD also oversees the firm’s activities\npertaining to Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nThe Group Data Management Office, part of the Group Operations and Technology Office, works with partners\nacross the firm to ensure robust governance over the collection, propagation and quality of the firm’s data.\nAdditionally, the Group Data Protection Office, part of Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance, ensures that\nthe firm processes personal data and responds to data subject rights exercised by individuals (including clients and\nemployees) in line with applicable data privacy laws and regulations.\nPolicies and procedures (including training)\nAs a firm, UBS operates to the highest possible standard. Our principles and policies guide how we use data and\ninformation, as well as how we develop and deploy technological solutions. We maintain policies and procedures\nto ensure everyone at UBS is aware of threats and the importance of CIS. A CIS end user and line manager policy\nis available internally to all UBS employees and consultants.\nIn recognition of the pace of digital change globally, our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the Code) includes a section\non the lawful and ethical use of data. The primary focus of this section is preparing employees for greater reliance\non big data, data models and artificial intelligence.\nIn 2023, we updated our UBS-internal Group Data Ethics Policy, which sets out the group-wide data ethics\nrequirements. While the principles set out in the policy apply to the processing or use of any client-identifying data\nand/or personal data, specific data ethics requirements apply for the use of (i) AI including machine learning and/or\n(ii)data analytics including both models and non-models (jointly referred to as Processing Activities). They must be\nconsidered during the design, development and deployment of new products, processes, or services and must\nconsider both input and output data.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 1 | Governance 110022\nThe requirements must be assessed, and Processing Activities approved as part of the central data ethics review\nprocess prior to commencing the Processing Activities. Data ethics requirements encompass the following: human\nagency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; data privacy; explainability; diversity, non-discrimination and\nfairness; social and environmental wellbeing; accountability.\nWe run a comprehensive, Group-wide education and awareness program, including addressing risks related to CIS.\nThe program features mandatory computer-based training modules (recurring, and requiring exam completion),\nnewsletters, and global and targeted awareness campaigns to all staff who have access to UBS systems. Additional\neducational campaigns, covering subjects such as phishing, malware infections, social engineering, tailgating, and\ndata classification and leakage, are deployed several times per year.\nAdditionally, we provide training specifically tailored for certain staff. Employees are also required to review policies\nand affirm compliance in our web-based Affirmation Online portal on an annual basis. All UBS employees can easily\naccess UBS’s information security portal to learn about information security threats. Selected management\nemployees are sent regular updates regarding cybersecurity developments and trends.\nWe also maintain a set of requirements for our third parties that stipulate our expectations and ensure these are\nformally acknowledged through a dedicated contractual annex.\nHandling data\nOur data protection policy framework covers the standards we commit to when processing personal data. This\nincludes that data is processed only for specific and explicit purposes and is adequate, relevant and not excessive\n(data minimization). Other key principles include that data subjects are informed of how their personal data is\nprocessed and that it is not processed for longer than necessary for the given processing purposes. UBS has\nimplemented processes to respond to data subjects exercising their rights, while adhering to applicable legal\nrequirements.\nWe communicate our client data use and storage policies to clients and seek consent for data use as required by\nlocal regulations. In these communications we are clear what this consent means, and which use cases do not\nrequire consent, for example certain legal obligations. We provide reasonable options for clients to be able to\nrevoke this consent.\nDealing with incidents\nOur Code sets out the principles and behaviors that define our ethical practices and the way we do business. Any\nviolation, whether it is of our Code, UBS policies or external laws, rules or regulations, may result in disciplinary\naction, up to and including dismissal. This includes information security incidents. Also, employees are, as part of\ntheir year-end performance rating, evaluated on their integrity. This includes doing the right thing, self-declaring\nincidents and issues, adhering to policies, challenging the status quo and raising their hand when things are not\nright, including potential security threats, and collaborating across teams, departments and divisions.\nWe aim to make the information security incident escalation process as simple as possible. For example, phishing\nemails can easily be reported by means of a dedicated button integrated within Outlook and available on all\ndevices.\nOur Group-wide incident-handling process enables any UBS person to report incidents and data breaches. Data-\nbreach-prevention processes, such as blocking of communication and proactive remediation of misplaced data in\nunprotected areas, are in place. Additionally, we encourage employees to report any issues and incidents as per\nthe incident-handling process, or to their line managers, and to follow up to ensure the matter is addressed. Any\ncompliance incidents can also be escalated through the whistleblowing process.\nWe also extend these processes to cover adverse information security events that take place at third parties but\nhave relevance to UBS’s information.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 1 | Governance 110033\nAppendix 2 – Environment\nOur transition plan\nOur transition plan supports our current decarbonization targets and ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3, activities. The structure of our plan follows the\nrecommendations of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) outlined in the “Financial Institutions\nNet-zero Transition Plans” guidelines. GFANZ published these guidelines, to which UBS contributed during their\ndevelopment, at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (the UNFCCC) (COP 27).\nUBS’s contribution to the development of these guidelines forms part of the Group’s industry engagement in the\nfinancial services sector to determine how best to support and finance clients’ transition to a low-carbon economy.\nContributing to such frameworks, in turn forms an important basis for developing our own approach to transition\nfinance.\nWe consider the GFANZ guidelines to be comprehensive and relevant for the financial sector but continue to\nmonitor other emerging standards that are compatible and have the potential to enhance our continued transition\nplan development. Our transition plan touches on numerous aspects within this Sustainability Report, which are\nreferenced in the table below.\n› Refer to gfanzero.com/our-work/financial-institution-net-zero-transition-plans for GFANZ’s recommendations on\ntransition plans\n# Theme Principles and key activities engaged in by UBS References for more information\nFoundation\n1 Objectives – It is our ambition to support clients through the world’s transition to – Refer to the “Strategy” section, “Our aspirations\nand a low-carbon economy and embed considerations of climate change and progress” sub-section of this report for a\npriorities risks and opportunities across the bank for the benefit of our description of our targets and progress on\nstakeholders, now and in the future. financing, investing and own operations.\n– Helping our clients navigate the challenges of an orderly transition to – Refer to the “Environment” section, “Our climate\na low-carbon economy and build climate-resilient business models, as roadmap” sub-section of this report for an\nwell as mobilizing private and institutional capital toward this overview of what we are aiming for to support\ntransition, is at the core of this ambition and our approach to climate. the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n– We have updated our sustainability strategy and approach to climate – Refer to the “Our approach to climate” sub-\nto better support our own transition as well as the transition of our section of the Supplement to the UBS Group\nclients, and we continue to refine and enhance our transition plan in Sustainability Report 2023 for more information\nline with evolving client needs and industry guidance to ensure it about our approach and key objectives to\nremains appropriate for our business activities and aligned to external support our climate-related ambitions.\nmarket practice and standards. – Refer to the “Environment” section, “Supporting\n– By 2050, our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) our clients’ low-carbon transition” sub-section of\nemissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities. this report for an overview of how we support\n– We aspire to address our financed emissions by aligning specified our clients’ transition.\nsectors to decarbonization pathways.

We will continue to adjust our\napproach in line with external developments, as well as evolving best practices for the financial sector and climate science. Refer to the “Climate-related\nmethodologies – decarbonization approach for our financing activities” section of the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available at\nubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about parts of the value chain within sectors covered by metrics and targets. Metrics are based on gross\nexposure, which includes total loans and advances to customers, fair value loans and guarantees as well as irrevocable loan commitments. Exclusions from scope\nof analysis primarily comprise Financial Services and other exposure to private individuals. 2 As part of our ship finance strategy, ships in scope of Poseidon\nPrinciples are assessed on criteria which aim at portfolio´s alignment to the Poseidon Principles decarbonization trajectories. The Poseidon Principles are a\nframework for assessing and disclosing, on an annual basis, the climate alignment of in-scope ship finance portfolios to the ambition of the International\nMaritime Organization (the IMO), including its 2023 Revised GHG Strategy for GHG emissions from international shipping to decrease to net zero by or around\n2050 (compared to 2008 levels). 3 In line with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, we acknowledge that the scope for asset managers to invest for net\nzero depends on the mandates agreed with clients and clients’ and managers’ regulatory environments. Also, on the expectation that governments will follow\nthrough on their own commitments to ensure the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met, including increasing the ambition of their Nationally Determined\nContributions, and in the context of investing, our legal duties to clients and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. In some asset classes or for some\ninvestment strategies, agreed net-zero methodologies do not yet exist. Where our ability to align our approach to investments with the goal of net zero emissions\nby 2050 is, today, constrained, we commit to embark with determination and ambition on a journey, and to challenge and seek to overcome the constraints\nwe face. 4 Scope 2 emissions are market-based emissions. The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5–10% residuals\nrequired for net zero (per the definition of a “net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our\nambition for 2050. In 2024, we will be reviewing our 2025 scope 1 and 2 target for achievability for the combined organization and for alignment with latest\nguidance. 5 In 2024, we may review our target for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and for alignment with latest guidance. Our GHG key\nvendors are those vendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111100\nOur approach to nature\nWhy nature is important to us\nClimate and nature are deeply intertwined. Just as in the financial world, where assets give rise to revenue flows,\nthe natural environment consists of stocks of assets (i.e., natural capital) that provide benefits to people and the\neconomy (i.e., ecosystem services). Biodiversity is an essential characteristic of nature, critical for maintaining the\nquality, resilience and quantity of ecosystem assets and the provision of ecosystem services that businesses and\nsociety rely upon. This has been documented through a range of research initiatives, including the Global\nassessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services from the Intergovernmental Science–Policy Platform on\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the UK Government-sponsored The Economics of Biodiversity: The\nDasgupta Review.\nWe recognize the importance of understanding human dependencies and impacts on nature, to better understand\nthe transmission channels through which our clients and UBS may face risks and opportunities. We view nature,\nalongside climate, as a risk driver that may manifest in transition and physical risks that both we and our clients need\nto manage.\n›\nRefer to the “Strategy” section of this report for more information about our sustainability strategy\nOur governance\nOur sustainability activities, including nature-related matters, are overseen at the highest level of the firm and\nmanaged by the Group Sustainability and Impact organization. Our Chief Sustainability Office leads a cross-firm\nNature Working Group that meets monthly to consider nature-related activities, including regulatory and market\ndevelopments, and to coordinate activities across the firm.\n›\nRefer to the “Governance” section of this report for more information about our sustainability governance,\nincluding on nature\nOur strategy\nThe Planet pillar of our overarching sustainability strategy encompasses our approach to nature, mirroring that for\nclimate, and is underpinned by three key objectives:\n– supporting our clients’ low-carbon transition;\n– reducing our climate impact;\n– managing the risks of climate change to our business.\nTo address the needs of our clients, manage risks and contribute to positive impact, we have set standards for\nfinancing, investments and supply chain management decisions, including explicit aspects related to nature. Within\nour business divisions, we help our clients explore the opportunities related to natural capital and nature-positive\nsolutions. We believe our work on nature is just beginning and will rapidly develop in line with market needs,\nregulations, data methodology developments and voluntary commitments.\nOur strategy will further evolve as our understanding of the risks and opportunities connected to nature-related\nimpacts and dependencies deepens. As data and methodologies continue to improve, this will support the further\nanalysis of impacts and dependencies and the resulting risks and opportunities. We believe the release of the TNFD\nrecommendations and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards on nature will encourage further\ndevelopments in data and methodologies. We continue to engage with providers of nature-related data and\nmethodologies that may support our own work.\nAs part of this effort in 2023, UBS joined a bank-specific working group aimed at addressing risks and opportunities\nin the agricultural sector. The working group is convened by the World Economic Forum’s Tropical Forest Alliance\n(TFA) finance sector engagement team.\n›\nRefer to the “Strategy” section of this report for more information about our sustainability strategy\nSeeking nature-related opportunities\nWe already support our clients in identifying climate-related opportunities and look to provide similar support in\nrelation to nature, albeit that work is at an early stage.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111111\nAs part of this effort, the UBS Sustainability and Impact Institute (the Institute) has published various thought-\nleadership reports focusing on the topic of nature. These include From Ozone to Oxygen – Opportunities and Risks\nin Natural Capital, published in 2022, which offered a detailed review of the importance of nature and made a\nnumber of recommendations for key stakeholders to help address nature-related issues through financing, investing\nand advising. More recently, in July 2023, the Institute published Taking root – Mainstreaming natural capital\naccounting to meet global biodiversity goals. That report suggests that natural capital accounting (NCA) could be\nintegral to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 if its development speeds up and presents a set of strategies that\ninvestors and financers, NGOs, corporations and other stakeholders could pursue to help mainstream NCA. Also in\n2023, the Credit Suisse Research Institute contributed to the dialogues on a global plastic treaty by publishing\nPlastic pollution: Pathways to net zero. Highlighting the challenges of ever-increasing plastic waste, including for\nbiodiversity, this report discussed strategies for mitigation and adaptation, including waste management and the\npossibility of a global plastics treaty.\nManaging nature-related risks\nNature-related risks refer to how organizations and people depend on and impact natural capital, which is defined\nas natural resources that combine to yield a flow of benefits to people.\n›\nRefer to the “Managing sustainability and climate risks” section of this report for a description of our climate and\nnature risk management\nWe have established criteria to assess nature-related risks through our firm’s standards. They address controversial\nactivities and areas of concern (including sensitive locations), recognizing that UBS is both directly and indirectly\nexposed through our business activities. We limit business with clients or suppliers that may endanger animal species\nand/or contribute to deforestation and its related impacts, such as forest degradation.\n› Refer to the Supplement to this report, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about\nthe sustainability and climate risk policy framework\nOur sustainability and climate risk framework includes stipulation of controversial activities we will not knowingly\nengage in, and areas of concern where we will only engage subject to stringent criteria.\nClients, transactions or suppliers potentially in breach of our standards, or otherwise subject to significant climate,\nenvironmental and human rights controversies, are referred to our SCR unit, which approves or rejects the cases\nafter assessing their compliance with the firm’s risk appetite standards. Advanced data analytics on companies\nassociated with such risks is integrated into the web-based compliance tool used by our staff before they enter into\na client or supplier relationship, or a transaction. The systematic nature of this tool significantly enhances our ability\nto identify potential risk. In 2023, the Stainability and Climate Risk unit performed 3,297 assessments, these\nincluded 419 assessments focused on the agribusiness sector.\n› Refer to the Supplement to this report, available at ubs.com/sustainability-reporting, for more information about\nthe sustainability and climate risk assessment table\nOur investing clients and client assets\nIn our wealth management business, it has been our long-standing view that sustainable investing strategies look\nbeyond environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration. Thus, integrating material ESG information into\ninvestment analysis and decisions is increasingly seen as a requirement for the investment management industry.\nExclusions, ESG integration and stewardship are a set of effective tools that can be incorporated not only in\nsustainable but also in conventional investment strategies: they could also be paramount in addressing nature as\npart of investments more broadly.\nTo facilitate a better use of these tools, our wealth management Chief Investment Office has identified six\nsustainability topics that encompass the major challenges that both impact and are impacted by corporations and\ngovernments, and can help inform investment decisions where relevant:\n– pollution and waste\n– climate change\n– water\n– people\n– governance\n– products and services\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111122\nThese topics are selected on the basis of industry best practices, relevance to company financial outcomes, data\navailability and reliability, and client feedback on the issues they care most about. Five of the topics (pollution and\nwaste, climate change, water, people, and governance) focus on how well companies manage these issues within\ntheir operations and, therefore, reflect a company’s operational footprint. This is where issues such as the\nadvancement of corporate policies and practices on biodiversity preservation and pollution reduction would be\ncaptured and subsequently inform investment decisions where relevant. The sixth topic (products and services)\nfocuses on whether the company’s offering and its supply chain management address sustainability challenges\ndirectly and it therefore captures a company’s delivery of solutions that directly mitigate environmental (and social)\nchallenges, for instance within climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution management and addressing\nwater scarcity.\nThe six-topic framework is designed to offer a more simplified and targeted approach to sustainability challenges,\nincluding those related to nature, and specifically to inform the decisions of private investors. They represent\nuniversal sustainability challenges, although the priority of each topic may differ across industries. Additionally, the\ncompanies that manage these topics well are not necessarily those with the least-adverse environmental or social\nimpact. In fact, sectors with the greatest exposure to sustainability risk factors often have a greater imperative\n(regulatory or reputation-driven) to work to minimize their negative impact.\nGlobal Wealth Management uses these topics to score companies, inform investment analysis, allocate discretionary\ncapital where relevant, and provide targeted advice to private and family office clients based on their stated\nsustainability preferences. For example, when considering nature-related information, the portfolio managers, and\nsubsequently investors, would turn towards the topics of climate change, pollution and waste, water, and products\nand services to identify potential nature-related risks or opportunities that were not apparent from their financial\nanalysis. Investors could also use the scores to assess the sustainability profile of their portfolios, to better\nunderstand their exposure to potential sustainability risks and opportunities, as well as to evaluate whether their\ninvestments are aligned with their personal values and interests. UBS also sources indicators of whether companies\nare involved in a range of activities, including environmental ones, such as use of genetically modified organisms\nor involvement in severe pollution actions, that some investors may wish to exclude.\nHow we approach natural capital risks in our investments\nAs an asset manager, we recognize that biodiversity loss and degradation is a source of material financial risk, and\nmanaging this risk is integral to fulfilling our fiduciary duties toward our clients. We also recognize that investing\nsustainably can promote actions that contribute to the preservation and restoration of natural capital of our planet.\nCurrently, we manage nature-related risks as part of our ESG integration processes. We use a proprietary ESG risk\ndashboard that combines multiple data sources to identify companies with material ESG risks. Natural capital risks,\nsuch as water and forest risks, are embedded in the methodologies of these underlying data sources, and our\ninvestment teams utilize these ESG factors alongside traditional financial metrics and proprietary ESG sector\nmateriality maps to assess the risk-return profile in the investment process.\nIn 2023, we built on efforts started in 2022 to develop an investor thematic engagement program that works with\ninvestee companies to encourage actions that ensure natural capital is accounted for and included in their financial\nand economic decision-making. We developed this program by consulting with our clients, investment teams and\na wide array of external experts to shape our priorities and approach to natural capital. In addition to our proprietary\nESG sector materiality maps, we also conducted a heatmap assessment, mapping ENCORE data to our listed equity\nand fixed income corporate investments to understand exposure to biodiversity risks at the industry level. This\nprocess has led us to identify three specific areas that form the basis of our engagement program on natural capital\nrisks and opportunities: forests, water, and the climate-diversity nexus.\nIn 2023, we also joined Nature Action 100 and PRI’s Stewardship Initiative Spring to support the Asset Management\nstewardship strategy. Nature Action 100 is a global investor engagement initiative focused on driving greater\ncorporate ambition and action to reverse nature and biodiversity loss. The initiative engages companies in key\nsectors that are deemed to be systemically important in reversing nature and biodiversity loss by 2030. UBS is also\none of the members of the Advisory Committee.\nNatural capital risks are considered across our real estate and private market investments. For example, our farmland\nbusiness is a founding member of Leading Harvest, an outcomes-based sustainability standard that addresses\neconomic, environmental, social, and governance matters through farm management. The Leading Harvest\nFarmland Management Standard comprises 13 objectives, 33 performance measures and 71 indicators that are\ncore to farmland sustainability. Such nature-based objectives and performance measures include biodiversity\nconservation through species protection, wildlife habitat conservation, avoided land conversion, and crop diversity.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111133\nSince 2020, the inaugural year of the standard, 100% of the farmland acres we manage have been enrolled and\nas of 2023, 100% of the farmland acres we manage are certified. Conformance to the standard is assured through\nindependent, third-party certification.\nDuring 2023, Asset Management (Credit Suisse) had thematic engagements with a specific focus on the three areas\nof food systems, water and forest conservation. Going forward, the stewardship and engagement activities will be\nprogressively integrated.\n› Refer to ubs.com/global/en/assetmanagement/capabilities/sustainable-investing/stewardship-engagement for our\napproach to stewardship\n› Refer to am.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/asset-management/insights/sustainable-investing/active-ownership.html for\nAsset Management (Credit Suisse)’s approach to stewardship\nOur vendors and operational impact\nOur firm-wide Responsible Supply Chain Management (RSCM) framework is based on identifying, assessing, and\nmonitoring vendor practices on environmental and social topics. We have taken steps to protect biodiversity across\nour offices, mitigate the impact of our operations and raise awareness among our staff. Initiatives include the\ninstallation of green roofs featuring rooftop vegetable gardens and beehives at selected office locations, as well as\norganizing tree planting activities across Europe. Additionally, we obtained recertification for one of our Zürich\noffices from Natur & Wirtschaft, a Swiss foundation focused on promoting biodiversity conservation in settlement\nareas. Our portfolio includes further certified areas, highlighting a focus on green spaces with native plants and\nadditional biodiversity features. We also organized annual events such as Clean-Up Day, during which UBS\nvolunteers join forces to clean up street litter in their respective cities, and World Bee Day, featuring webinars and\nawareness campaigns highlighting the critical role of bees to our natural ecosystem.\nFinally, in our corporate carbon offsetting activities, we make use of nature-based solutions, as well as technological\ncarbon capture and storage solutions. As standards in this area continue to evolve (e.g., the Core Carbon Principles\nfrom the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets), we will seek to apply them to our activities.\n›\nRefer to the “Social” section of this report for a description of our Responsible Supply Chain Management\nMobilizing capital for nature\nIn order to support our investing clients, we continue to explore products and solutions that have a significant\nnature-related sustainability focus or may even be able to generate more net nature-positive impacts. In Global\nWealth Management, for example, an investment solution that was launched in 2021 and aligns to our Future of\nEarth publication promotes environmental objectives built around the themes of sustainable land use, sustainable\nwater use, the shift to clean energy and provision of health solutions that may help mitigate the impacts of\nenvironmental degradation on human health.\nWe also have the opportunity to add certain environmental and nature-aligned products solutions to the GWM\noffering as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. One example is an ocean engagement fund\nstrategy, focused on public company engagement to drive ocean health. We continue to explore ways to develop\nfurther products and solutions in our wealth and asset management businesses.\nWe also continue to look for ways in which clients may be able to have more direct impact. This work is centered\nin the UBS Optimus network of foundations and other philanthropic services that provide opportunities for high\nnet worth clients who may wish to undertake net-positive nature activities and are willing to do so in a way that\ngenerates less-than-market returns.\nThe work of the UBS Optimus network of foundations on mangrove conservation and blue carbon continued in\n2023, as the UBS Optimus network of foundations believes that mangrove restoration can not only be a form of\nclimate action through carbon sequestration but can also provide broader natural capital benefits through flood\nprotection, and even have social co-benefits by supporting ecotourism in critical areas.\nFurther exploring the power of philanthropy to deliver change at scale, the UBS Climate Collective, an impact\nnetwork for philanthropists and organizations, addresses the issue of climate mitigation and adaptation globally by\ntackling problems locally and enabling replication and scale to other countries. The Collective supports and invests\nin mangrove conservation and blue carbon projects in Southeast Asia, which is particularly vulnerable to climate\nchange, through a portfolio of nine impact-led organizations in Vietnam and Indonesia focused on building coastal\nresilience to mitigate climate change and maximize social and biodiversity benefits. In 2023, the Collective\nestablished 42 partnerships, including with local and national governments, as well as private sector, local and\ninternational NGOs and funding partners, with the aim of generating systemic impact through collective action.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111144\nIn 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations agreed to fund its nature-based solutions partner, Terratai, over\na three-year period. Terratai is creating and supporting businesses that are tackling the systemic food system\nchallenges contributing to nature and biodiversity loss in Asia.\nThis fits squarely with the UBS Optimus network of foundations’ ecosystem development approach to supporting\nand fostering the incubation, growth and scaling of impactful enterprises and fills a gap we have identified for\ninvestment opportunities in innovative nature-based solutions.\nThe UBS Optimus network of foundations has also been exploring the use of blended finance structures to mobilize\ncapital for nature. In 2022, it closed its first impact and blended deals in nature: one of them supporting marine\nprotected area governance, sustainable fisheries and ecotourism, with Blue Alliance in the Philippines. Blue Alliance\nworks across a network of nine Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Philippines covering 5,200 hectares of coastal\nand marine ecosystems.\nFor our financing clients, we include nature considerations alongside other topics as part of our ambition to be a\nsustainable finance partner of choice. In 2023, Credit Suisse Group helped facilitate a foreign debt conversion by\nthe government of Ecuador replacing USD 1.62 billion of external debt with new debt of USD 652 million on better\nterms. Associated with that, Ecuador agreed to provide an estimated USD 323 million for marine conservation in\nthe Galápagos Islands over the next 18.5 years by endowing an independent Galapagos Life Fund.\nFinally, in 2023, Credit Suisse Group hosted the 10th annual Conservation Finance Conference in conjunction with\nlongstanding partners at Cornell University and The Nature Conservancy. The 2023 conference focused on nature\naction catalyzed across the private and public sectors and explored how institutional investors and businesses are\nstepping up to protect nature.\nOur engagement and outlook\nParticipation in various industry collaborations is part of our effort to support our clients and further develop nature\nmarkets. In addition to our work in the global TNFD network, we helped Swiss Sustainable Finance and the UN\nGlobal Compact’s Swiss network to establish a Swiss TNFD national consultation group in 2022. In 2023, we gave\npresentations on the TNFD several times to support capacity building in our home market. In the same year, we\nalso co-chaired the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking Nature working group that developed initial guidance\non nature target setting for financial institutions. Also in 2023, we joined a World Economic Forum and Tropical\nForest Alliance industry working group and a local Brazil working group with Global Canopy to explore collaboration\non the critical issue of deforestation.\nTo support the development and growth of the conservation finance market, Credit Suisse Group was a co-founder\nof the Coalition for Private Investment in Conservation (CPIC) in 2016. CPIC’s members included leading civil society\norganizations, private and public-sector financial institutions, and academia, with the shared aim of working\ntogether to deliver a material increase in private, return-seeking investment in conservation. We are continuing this\nlong-standing relationship going forward as UBS.\nWe also engage with policymakers and regulators regarding nature-related risk management. Through our\nleadership of the Institute of International Finance Sustainable Finance Working Group, we engaged with the\nNetwork for Greening the Financial System, the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group and the International\nPlatform for Sustainable Finance (among others working on the topic).\nIn future years, we expect rapid improvements in data and methodologies, as well as the development of new\nfinancing and investing approaches. In particular, we expect an increased focus on location- and company-specific\naspects of nature and a shift away from sector and country averages that form the basis for most of the portfolio-\nlevel analytical approaches today. We are exploring the application of emerging analytical approaches, such as\nbiodiversity footprints and nature value-at-risk methodologies. We will continue to engage with regulators, industry\npeers, collaborative platforms and individual service providers, and vendors to understand and support emerging\npractices and offerings in the market.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 2 | Environment 111155\nAppendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit\nAppendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit\nSuisse AG\nSuisse AG\nDuring 2023, certain sustainability-related policies, processes and activities have continued at Credit Suisse,\nDuring 2023, certain sustainability-related policies, processes and activities have continued at Credit Suisse,\nfollowing the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group by UBS Group.

These goals include our ambitions for environmental sustainability\nin our operations, including carbon emissions, in the business we do with clients and in products that we offer.\nThey also include goals or aspirations for diversity in our workforce and supply chain, and support for the United\nNations Sustainable Development Goals. There is substantial uncertainty as to the scope of actions that may be\nrequired of us, governments and others to achieve the goals we have set, and many of our goals and objectives are\nonly achievable with a combination of government and private action. National and international standards and\nexpectations, industry and scientific practices, regulatory taxonomies, and disclosure obligations addressing these\nmatters are relatively immature and are rapidly evolving. In addition, there are significant limitations in the data\navailable to measure our climate and other goals. Although we have defined and disclosed our goals based on the\nstandards existing at the time of disclosure, there can be no assurance (i) that the various ESG regulatory and\ndisclosure regimes under which we operate will not come into conflict with one another, (ii) that the current\nstandards will not be interpreted differently than our understanding or change in a manner that substantially\nincreases the cost or effort for us to achieve such goals or (iii) that additional data or methods, whether voluntary\nor required by regulation, may substantially change our calculation of our goals and ambitions. It is possible that\nsuch goals may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve. The evolving standards may\nalso require us to substantially change the stated goals and ambitions. If we are not able to achieve the goals we\nhave set, or can only do so at significant expense to our business, we may fail to meet regulatory expectations,\nincur damage to our reputation or be exposed to an increased risk of litigation or other adverse action.\nWhile ESG regulatory regimes and international standards are being developed, including to require consideration\nof ESG risks in investment decisions, some jurisdictions, notably in the US, have developed rules restricting the\nconsideration of ESG factors in investment and business decisions. Under these anti-ESG rules, companies that are\nperceived as boycotting or discriminating against certain industries may be restricted from doing business with\ncertain governmental entities. Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are considered as discriminating\nagainst companies based on ESG considerations, or if further anti-ESG rules are developed or broadened.\nA major focus of US and other countries’ governmental policies relating to financial institutions in recent years has\nbeen on fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. We are required to maintain effective policies,\nprocedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, and to verify the\nidentity of our clients under the laws of many of the countries in which we operate. We are also subject to laws\nand regulations related to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials by others, such as the US Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that\nare designed to comply with such laws and regulations. Notwithstanding this, US regulators have found deficiencies\nin the design and operation of anti-money-laundering programs in our US operations. We have undertaken a\nsignificant program to address these regulatory findings with the objective of fully meeting regulatory expectations\nfor our programs. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing or corruption, or any failure of our programs in these areas, could have serious consequences both from\nlegal enforcement action and from damage to our reputation. Frequent changes in sanctions imposed and\nincreasingly complex sanctions imposed on countries, entities and individuals, as exemplified by the breadth and\nscope of the sanctions imposed in relation to the war in Ukraine, increase our cost of monitoring and complying\nwith sanctions requirements and increase the risk that we will not identify in a timely manner client activity that is\nsubject to a sanction.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 113300\nThe financial services industry is characterized by intense competition, continuous innovation, restrictive, detailed\nand sometimes fragmented regulation and ongoing consolidation. We face competition at the level of local markets\nand individual business lines and from global financial institutions that are comparable to us in their size and\nbreadth, as well as competition from new technology-based market entrants, which may not be subject to the\nsame level of regulation. Barriers to entry in individual markets and pricing levels are being eroded by new\ntechnology. We expect these trends to continue and competition to increase. Our competitive strength and market\nposition could be eroded if we are unable to identify market trends and developments, do not respond to such\ntrends and developments by devising and implementing adequate business strategies, do not adequately develop\nor update our technology, including our digital channels and tools, or are unable to attract or retain the qualified\npeople needed.\nThe amount and structure of our employee compensation is affected not only by our business results but also by\ncompetitive factors and regulatory considerations.\nIn response to the demands of various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities and shareholders, and in order\nto better align the interests of our staff with other stakeholders, we have increased average deferral periods for\nstock awards, expanded forfeiture provisions and, to a more limited extent, introduced clawback provisions for\ncertain awards linked to business performance. We have also introduced individual caps on the proportion of fixed\nto variable pay for the members of the Group Executive Board (GEB), as well as certain other employees. UBS will\nalso be required to introduce and enforce provisions requiring UBS to recover from GEB members and certain other\nexecutives a portion of performance-based incentive compensation in the event that the UBS Group or another\nentity with securities listed on a US national securities exchange, is required to restate its financial statements as a\nresult of a material error.\n› Refer to the “Risk factors” and “Risk management and control” sections of our UBS Group Annual Report 2023 for\nmore information\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 113311\nNon-financial disclosures pursuant to the German law implementing EU directive 2014/95 (CSR-RUG)\nand Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 964b.\nThis report comprises the “non-financial” disclosures required for UBS Group AG, and its subsidiaries, including\nUBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, under the Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 964b.

Article 8 of that Regulation requires entities that are subject to the Non-financial Reporting\nDirective2 (NFRD) to provide information to investors about the environmental performance of economic activities\nassociated with certain of their balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. Under this Regulation, UBS AG and\nUBS Europe SE are required to provide information on taxonomy-eligible activities, and, starting from 2023, on\ntaxonomy-aligned activities, alongside other qualitative information, based on their prudential scope of\nconsolidation, which for UBS AG is on a standalone basis (i.e. excluding subsidiaries), and for UBS Europe SE is on\na consolidated basis. Taxonomy-eligible activities are activities identified as being in scope for technical screening\nunder the Regulation. Taxonomy-aligned activities represent the proportion of taxonomy-eligible activities that\nsatisfy the requirements in the Regulation, meaning that they contribute substantially to defined environmental\nobjectives, do not significantly harm any other environmental objectives, are carried out in compliance with certain\nminimum safeguards, and comply with certain technical screening criteria.\nThese disclosures have been prepared based on the requirements applicable to credit institutions, which is the principal\nbusiness activity of both UBS AG at a standalone level and UBS Europe SE at a consolidated level. Under the Regulation,\ncredit institutions are required to report taxonomy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to demonstrate the extent to\nwhich their activities relate to sustainable economic activities, as defined by the Regulation. The Green Asset Ratio\n(GAR) is a KPI calculated as a percentage of EU taxonomy-aligned assets as a proportion of total covered assets,\nwhereby:\n– the numerator is determined based on loans and advances, debt securities, equities and repossessed collateral,\nwhere the counterparty or the issuer is subject to NFRD reporting and\n– the denominator includes total covered assets, which represent total assets irrespective of whether the associated\ncounterparty or issuer is subject to NFRD reporting; the denominator excludes financial assets held for trading,\nexposures to central banks, central governments and supranational issuers.\nCredit institutions are required to calculate and disclose KPIs based upon the turnover KPIs and, separately, the\ncapital expenditure (CapEx) KPIs reported by counterparties and investees. Credit institutions are also required to\ncalculate and disclose turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs for off-balance sheet exposures, including financial\nguarantees issued but excluding loan commitments, and assets under management.\nGAR KPI stock is calculated on period end exposures while GAR KPI flow is calculated for new exposures during the\nreported period.\nAll pre-defined templates, as set out on the following pages, are presented twice, leveraging information published\nby counterparties and investees on the proportion of their activities associated with environmentally sustainable\neconomic activities, based on their turnover and based on their CapEx.\nUnder the Regulation, there is no requirement to report comparative information when reporting EU Taxonomy\nKPIs for 2023. Trading book KPIs and Fee and Commission KPIs are required to be reported from 1 January 2026.\nLimitations in implementation of the European Commission Draft Commission Notice\nIn December 2023, the European Commission issued a Draft Commission Notice on the interpretation and\nimplementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy\nRegulation (FAQs), which contains guidance on a number of aspects of the Regulation. These disclosures have been\nprepared on a best-efforts basis after taking into consideration, to the extent it was practicable, the guidance\nprovided in the FAQs. Given the short lead time available for the implementation of these disclosures, the 2023\ndisclosures for UBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated do not reflect the following aspects stipulated\nby the draft FAQs:\n– The Proportion of total new assets covered that is required by the GAR KPI flow template is not presented, as it\nwas not possible to identify new assets for the purpose of determining the flow for those assets that are not\nsubject to taxonomy-eligibility and -alignment assessment for the current reporting period, for example\nderivatives.\n– The template KPI off-balance sheet exposures – Stock is not replicated for the flow of off-balance sheet positions.\n1 Delegated Act of EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852; Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 supplementing Taxonomy Regulation; Commission\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 supplementing Taxonomy Regulation and amending Disclosures Delegated Act\n2 Directive 2014/95/EU\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 113333\n– The Nuclear and Fossil Gas templates have not been produced for off-balance sheet exposures and for the flow\nof new assets.\nWith the ongoing implementation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the development of market practices, the\navailability and quality of relevant information is expected to improve. This may affect the basis of preparation and\nresult in disclosures in future periods being refined.\nBasis of preparation\nIn compliance with the Regulation, the assets of UBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated presented in\nthe tables below have been determined based on IFRS Accounting Standards and attributed to the taxonomy-\neligible and taxonomy-aligned activities of relevant investees and counterparties. Where financial assets and\nfinancial liabilities were presented net, based on the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation\nunder IFRS Accounting Standards, the effect of netting has been reversed in arriving at the disclosures presented\nbelow.\nTaxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment KPIs are required to be determined by financial institutions based on\nthe actual information sourced from counterparties and investees. More specifically, when the use of proceeds is\nunknown, the taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment KPIs presented below are determined based on the\nturnover and CapEx-based KPIs of non-financial counterparties and investees, and any applicable KPIs of financial\ncounterparties and investees. Residential mortgages to households are assessed for taxonomy-alignment for the\nClimate Change Mitigation objective based on the use of proceeds, with alignment being determined based on\navailable Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and physical risk.\nEntities are required to provide disclosures on the environmental objectives Water and marine resources, Circular\neconomy, Pollution, and Biodiversity and ecosystems from 1 January 2024. Consequently, due to the lack of\navailability of information directly reported by counterparties and investees in respect of their activities in the context\nof these environmental objectives, disclosures in the tables below are provided for Climate change mitigation (CCM)\nand Climate change adaptation (CCA) environmental objectives only. For residential mortgages to households\ncollateralized by residential immovable properties, which are considered taxonomy-eligible, the assessment of\ntaxonomy-alignment was limited to UK mortgages only, due to data availability.\nExposures to, and investments in, undertakings not subject to NFRD reporting are excluded from the taxonomy-\neligibility and taxonomy-alignment calculation and presented separately. Due to data limitations in assessing\ntaxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment, several judgments, assumptions and simplifications have been made.\nMore specifically:\n– Counterparties and investees domiciled in the EU within certain industry groups, according to our judgment\nexercised and supported by empirical evidence, are considered not to be within the scope of NFRD reporting\n(e.g., hedge funds, collective investment schemes, special purpose vehicles etc.).\n– Non-EU domiciled counterparties and investees are assumed to not be subject to NFRD reporting.\nDue to limitations in data availability, the methodology for determining taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-\nalignment as set out in the tables below has been developed on the basis of the following assumptions:\n– In the most recent reporting period, non-financial counterparties reported no disaggregation of taxonomy-\neligibility per environmental objective. As a consequence, no information has been reported in the tables below\nin respect of these counterparties, on taxonomy-eligibility for each environmental objective, with the entire\namount related to taxonomy-eligible activities attributed to the Total (CCM+CCA) column.\n– Only from 1 January 2023 were financial institutions required to report taxonomy-alignment, hence their\nreported taxonomy-related information that forms the basis of the disclosures did not include taxonomy-\nalignment KPIs, and correspondingly, the taxonomy-alignment assigned to these counterparties in the tables\nbelow is zero; when financial counterparties in their publicly available disclosures reported only one KPI, without\nspecifying whether that reported KPI is a turnover-based or a CapEx-based measure, it is assumed to be a\nturnover-based KPI.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 113344\n– In respect of the exposures to insurance and reinsurance undertakings that provide both life and non-life services,\ndetermination of the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs was based on the actual proportion of revenues\nattributable to life and non-life services publicly reported by these insurance and reinsurance undertakings, unless\nthe information about the proportion of revenues was not available, in which case equal weighting was applied\nto each of these services.\n– In the absence of actual more detailed information about the use of proceeds, including in respect of\nenvironmentally sustainable bonds, the assessment of the taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment has been\nperformed at the issuer level.\n– For securities-financing transactions transacted through central clearing houses, the counterparty subject to\ntaxonomy-assessment is considered to be the central clearing house.\n– Cash positions included within assets under management have been excluded from the taxonomy-eligibility and\ntaxonomy-alignment assessment (i.e. excluded from the numerator).\nEconomic activities in the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors are required to be reported in separate templates.\nUBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated have not produced these templates for the year ended\n31 December 2023 as the gross carrying amounts of their exposures to these sectors were in total USD 0.2bn for\nUBS AG standalone, and USD 0.1bn for UBS Europe SE consolidated, which is considered immaterial to these\nentities’ operations.\nArt. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation - Summary of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for\nUBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated\nUBS AG standalone UBS Europe SE consolidated\n31.12.23 31.12.23\nMain KPI Additional KPIs Main KPI Additional KPIs\nFinancial Assets under Financial Assets under\nGAR stock GAR flow guarantees management GAR stock GAR flow guarantees management\nTotal environmentally sustainable\nassets - turnover based (USD m) 98 1 0 203 0 0 0 723\nTotal environmentally sustainable\nassets - capex based (USD m) 98 1 0 464 0 0 0 1,786\nTurnover KPI (%) 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.5% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.1%\nCapEx KPI (%) 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 5.2%\nCoverage over total assets (%) 69.9% 1.4% 65.1% 12.2%\nAssets excluded from the numerator\nof the GAR (%)1 65.9% 52.8%\nAssets excluded from the denominator\nof the GAR (%)2 30.1% 34.9%\n1 Article 7(2) and (3) and Section 1.1.2. of Annex V of the Disclosures Delegated Act. 2 Article 7(1) and Section 1.2.4 of Annex V of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\nUBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated contribute 31.5% to the total assets of the UBS Group AG\nconsolidated scope under IFRS. UBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated have low KPIs for balance\nsheet stock and flow, and off-balance sheet financial guarantees because:\n- a significant proportion of the business, and, correspondingly, the total assets of both entities, is outside\nthe scope of EU taxonomy, i.e. it is transacted with counterparties and investees that are not subject to\nNFRD reporting, for example, because they are not domiciled in the EU or due to the nature of their\nunderlying business activity, such as Global Wealth Management Lombard lending to private individuals;\n- UBS AG standalone and UBS Europe SE consolidated include a significant amount of Group Treasury and\nInvestment Bank activities in their scopes. Most assets in these activities are within categories that are\nexcluded from taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment assessments (e.g., derivatives, trading assets,\netc.); and\n- for the remaining assets that are included in the taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment assessments,\nthe vast majority of the counterparties are financial institutions that have not been required to publish\nalignment KPIs for 2022, and hence UBS´s 2023 year-end taxonomy-alignment KPIs for counterparties in\nthe financial sector are reported as zero.\nBusiness strategy\nBusiness strategy, product design and client engagement efforts will also be considered further in future years in\nline with regulatory requirements and other considerations, as sustainable finance markets continue to develop.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 113355\n1 UBS AG standalone1\n1.1 UBS AG standalone - assets for the calculation of the GAR (Turnover)\n3311..1122..2233\nCClliimmaattee CChhaannggee MMiittiiggaattiioonn ((CCCCMM)) CClliimmaattee CChhaannggee AAddaappttaattiioonn ((CCCCAA)) TToottaall ((CCCCMM ++ CCCCAA))\nof which towards taxonomy relevant sectors of which towards taxonomy relevant sectors of which towards taxonomy relevant sectors\n(Taxonomy-eligible) (Taxonomy-eligible) (Taxonomy-eligible)\nof which environmentally sustainable of which environmentally sustainable of which environmentally sustainable\n(Taxonomy-aligned) (Taxonomy-aligned) (Taxonomy-aligned)\nTToottaall ggrroossss of which of which of which\nccaarrrryyiinngg use of of which of which use of of which use of of which of which\nUSD m aammoouunntt proceeds transitional enabling proceeds enabling proceeds transitional enabling\nGGAARR -- CCoovveerreedd aasssseettss iinn bbootthh nnuummeerraattoorr aanndd ddeennoommiinnaattoorr\nLLooaannss aanndd aaddvvaanncceess,, ddeebbtt sseeccuurriittiieess aanndd eeqquuiittyy iinnssttrruummeennttss nnoott hheelldd--ffoorr--ttrraaddiinngg\neelliiggiibbllee ffoorr GGAARR ccaallccuullaattiioonn 2277,,335577 22,,007744 9988 9988 00 00 33,,225533 9988 9988 00 00\nFFiinnaanncciiaall uunnddeerrttaakkiinnggss 99,,111133 00 00 11,,117799 00 00\nCredit institutions 8,640 0 0 1,068 0 0\nLoans and advances 6,339 0 0 508 0 0\nDebt securities 1,631 554\nEquity instruments 669 7\nOther financial corporations 473 110\nof which investment firms 0 0\nLoans and advances 0 0\nDebt securities\nEquity instruments\nof which management companies 0\nLoans and advances 0\nDebt securities\nEquity instruments\nof which insurance undertakings\nLoans and advances\nDebt securities\nEquity instruments\nNNoonn--ffiinnaanncciiaall uunnddeerrttaakkiinnggss 3300 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nLoans and advances 30 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nDebt securities 0 0\nEquity instruments 0 0\nHHoouusseehhoollddss 1188,,221122 22,,007744 9988 9988 22,,007744 9988 9988\nof which loans collateralized by residential immovable property 2,074 2,074 98 98 2,074 98 98\nof which building renovation loans\nof which motor vehicle loans\nLLooccaall ggoovveerrnnmmeennttss ffiinnaanncciinngg\nHousing financing\nOther local government financing\nCCoollllaatteerraall oobbttaaiinneedd bbyy ttaakkiinngg ppoosssseessssiioonn:: rreessiiddeennttiiaall aanndd ccoommmmeerrcciiaall iimmmmoovvaabbllee\npprrooppeerrttiieess 11\nTable continues below.\n11 Within tables in this section, blank fields generally indicate non-applicability or that presentation of any content would not be meaningful.

Box\nCH-4002 Basel\nTo the Management of Basel, 27 March 2024\nUBS Group AG, Zurich\nIndependent assurance report on selected sustainability metrics and\ninformation for the year ended 31 December 2023\nWe have been engaged to perform assurance engagements on certain sustainability metrics and information disclosed\nin the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, including the Supplement of UBS Group AG and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries (the Group or UBS) for the year ended 31 December 2023 (the Report). Specifically, we were engaged to\nprovide:\n limited assurance on sustainability metrics and information as referenced in the Group’s GRI (Global Reporting\nInitiative) Content Index and metrics identified in Appendix A (metrics and information in scope of limited\nassurance); and\n reasonable assurance on metrics identified in Appendix B (metrics in scope of reasonable assurance)\nOther than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagements, we did not perform\nassurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express an\nopinion or conclusion on this information.\nApplicable criteria\nThe Group defined as applicable criteria (applicable criteria):\n GRI Standards (a summary of the standards is presented on the GRI homepage); and\n the Group’s definitions and methods as defined in the ‘Basis of Reporting’ document (within the Supplement of the\nUBS Group Sustainability Report 2023). The ‘Basis of Reporting’ has been used as the applicable criteria for metrics\nidentified in Appendices A and B.\nWe believe that these criteria are a suitable basis for our limited and reasonable assurance engagements.\nResponsibility of the Management\nManagement is responsible for the selection of the applicable criteria and for preparation and presentation, in all\nmaterial respects, of the disclosed metrics and information in accordance with the applicable criteria. This responsibility\nincludes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the metrics\nand information that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIndependence and quality control\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for\nProfessional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board\nfor Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional\ncompetence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and\noperate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical\nrequirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 115599\nIndependent assurance report [placeholder – 2 of 9 pages]\nOur responsibility\nLimited assurance\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the metrics and information in scope of limited assurance, based on the\nevidence we have obtained.\nReasonable assurance\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the metrics in scope of reasonable assurance, based on the evidence we\nhave obtained.\nWe conducted our assurance engagements in accordance with the with the International Standard on Assurance\nEngagements (ISAE) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information.\nThis standard requires that we plan and perform these engagements to obtain limited or reasonable assurance as stated\nabove about whether the metrics and information in the Report are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error.\nSummary of work performed\nBased on risk and materiality considerations we have undertaken procedures to obtain sufficient evidence. The\nprocedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material\nmisstatements in the metrics and information in scope of limited assurance.\nLimited assurance\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in scope\nthan, for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance\nengagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable\nassurance engagement.\nReasonable assurance\nA reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves performing procedures to obtain evidence\nabout the metrics in scope of reasonable assurance. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment,\nincluding the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the metrics in the\nscope of reasonable assurance. In making those risk assessments, we considered internal control relevant to the\nGroup’s preparation of the metrics in scope of reasonable assurance.\nProcedures performed\nOur limited and reasonable assurance procedures included, amongst others, the following work:\n Conducting interviews with key personnel to understand the sustainability strategy and the process for\ndetermining material sustainability topics.\n Comparing material topics against key issues raised in stakeholder dialogues, areas of performance covered in\nexternal media reports and sustainability reports of UBS’s peers.\n Evaluating the appropriateness of the applicable criteria used, their consistent application and related\ndisclosures in the Report.\n Conducting interviews with key personal to understand the process for collecting, collating, and reporting the\nmetrics and information during the reporting period, including obtaining an understanding of internal control\nrelevant to the engagements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nGroup’s internal control.\n Undertaking analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data and to identify areas of the\nmetrics and information with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements\nand obtaining an understanding of any explanations provided for significant variances.\n Evaluating the appropriateness of metrics within the Report and the consistency of the metrics and information\npresented across the Report.\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 116600\nIndependent assurance report [placeholder – 3 of 9 pages]\nIn addition, our procedures over the metrics in scope of reasonable assurance included, but were not limited to:\n Performing process walkthroughs to obtain an understanding of Management’s reporting processes, including\nManagement’s internal control framework and guidelines.\n Selecting key items and representative samples based on statistical sampling methodology and agreeing to\nsource information to test the accuracy and completeness of the data, including the correct filtering and\nmapping of data based on the underlying applicable criteria.\nOur procedures did not include testing the accuracy of the externally published input data provided by third parties.\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance\nconclusion.\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDue to a lack of standardization regarding the measurement of the metrics, different, but acceptable approaches are\nemerging in the market which can affect comparability between entities and over time. In addition, there is a lack of\nhigh-quality data in certain areas which can further impact how the metrics is measured. Significant assumptions and\nlimitations are laid out in more detail in the ‘Basis of Reporting’ document.\nConclusion – limited assurance\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to\nbelieve that the metrics and information in scope of limited assurance for the year ended 31 December 2023 have not\nbeen prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\nOpinion – reasonable assurance\nIn our opinion, the metrics in scope of reasonable assurance for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been\nprepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\nRestricted use\nThis report is intended solely for the information and use of UBS to inform Management about the result of the\nassurance engagements. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned.\nErnst & Young Ltd.\nMaurice McCormick Eveline Hunziker\nPartner Executive in charge\nSustainability Report 2023 |

Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 116666\nKey terms and definitions\nSustainability\nIs commonly defined as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations\nto meet their own needs“ (United Nations (UN) Brundtland Commission, 1987). In this way, we sometimes refer to\nsustainability to imply a broader scope of resources that may be exhausted beyond those that impact climate\nchange. Our ambition is to conduct business and operations without negatively impacting the environment, society\nor the economy as a whole and, through our sustainability disclosure, to be transparent about how we are pursuing\nthis.\nSustainable Development Goals (the SDGs)\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all UN member states in 2015, provides a shared\nblueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart are the 17 UN Sustainable Development\nGoals (available on sdgs.un.org/goals), the SDGs, which are an urgent call for action by all countries – developed\nand developing – in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-\nin-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while\ntackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.\nESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)\nA framework to help stakeholders understand how an organization is managing risks and opportunities related to\nESG criteria or factors. It is often used in the context of investing, but – beyond the investment community – clients,\nsuppliers, and employees are also increasingly interested in how sustainable an organization’s operations are.\nSustainable finance\nSustainability focus: Strategies that have explicit sustainable intentions or objectives that drive the strategy.\nUnderlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products / services / use of\nproceeds.\nImpact investing: Investment strategies that have an explicit intention to generate measurable, verifiable, positive\nsustainability outcomes. Impact generated is attributable to investor action and/or contribution.\nGreen, social and sustainability loans and bonds are instruments made available exclusively to finance or re-finance,\nin whole or in part, new and/or existing eligible green and/or social projects that form part of a credible program\nfrom the borrower/issuer to improve their environmental and/or social footprint.\nSustainability-linked loans and bonds are any types of instruments which incentivize the borrower / issuer’s\nachievement of ambitious, predetermined Sustainable Performance Targets (SPTs) that are measured using\npredefined sustainability KPIs.\nLow-carbon economy\nRefers to a type of decarbonized economy that is based on low energy consumption and low levels of greenhouse\ngas (GHG) emissions.\nGHG emissions\nScope 1: Accounts for GHG emissions by UBS.\nScope 2: Accounts for indirect GHG emissions associated with the generation of imported / purchased electricity\n(grid average emission factor), heat or steam.\nScope 3: Accounts for GHG emissions resulting from activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting\norganization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.\nNet zero: Refers to cutting GHG emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed\nfrom the atmosphere.\nGHG key vendor: A top GHG scope 3 emitter relative to UBS’s overall scope 3 supply chain emissions and with\nwhich UBS has a long-term ongoing relationship.\nSustainability disclosure\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI): Provider of the world’s most widely used sustainability disclosure standards (the\nGRI Standards).\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental information 116687\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Provider of climate-related financial disclosure\nrecommendations designed to help companies provide better information to support informed capital allocation.\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD): Provider of nature-related financial disclosure\nrecommendations designed to help companies provide better information to support informed capital allocation.\nValue Reporting Foundation SASB Standards: Disclosure standards to guide the disclosure of officially declared\nmaterial sustainability information by companies to their investors.\nWorld Economic Forum International Business Council (WEF IBC): Provider of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics,\nwhich offer a set of universal, comparable disclosures focused on people, planet, prosperity and governance that\ncompanies can report on, regardless of industry or region.\nMateriality assessments\nWith regard to the materiality assessments included in this report (GRI-based and climate-related), the GRI requires\ncompanies to determine material topics that “represent the organization’s most significant impacts on the\neconomy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights.” The TCFD requires companies to\nconduct a double materiality assessment that looks at both the inside-out impact the company has on the\nenvironment and the outside-in impact climate-related activities might have on the company performance.\nAspiration\nDesire to achieve a particular goal.\nAmbition(s)\nAmbitions are parts of a long-term vision detailing what results a company aspires to accomplish and by when.\nTarget(s)\nTargets are smaller, interim steps or milestones towards an ambition that are aligned with its details. As individuals\nand teams within the organization reach their targets, the organization makes progress towards the ultimate\nambition(s).\nSustainability Report 2023 | Appendix 4 | Other supplemental
