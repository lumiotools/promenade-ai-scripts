BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Business\nVillage Farms International, Inc. (“VFF” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a\ncorporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). VFF’s principal operating subsidiaries as of September 30,\n2024 were Village Farms Canada Limited Partnership, Village Farms, L.P.(together, “Village Farms Fresh” or “VF Fresh”),\nPure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms”), Balanced Health Botanicals, LLC (“Balanced Health”) and VF Clean Energy, Inc.\n(\"VFCE\") and Leli Holland B. V. (\"Leli\"). VFF also owns an 80% interest in Rose LifeScience Inc. (“Rose”).\nThe address of the registered office of VFF is 79 Wellington Street West, Suite 3300, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5K 1N2.\nThe address of the principal executive office of VFF is 90 Colonial Center Pkwy, Lake Mary, Florida, United States, 32746.\nThe Company’s shares are listed on Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “VFF”.\nVillage Farms Fresh owns and operates sophisticated, highly intensive agricultural greenhouse facilities in British Columbia and\nTexas, where it produces, markets and sells premium-quality tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers. Its wholly owned\nsubsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is a vertically integrated Licensed Producer and supplier of cannabis products sold to customers\nthroughout Canada and internationally. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Balanced Health, develops and sells high-\nquality, cannabidiol (“CBD”) based products including ingestible, edible and topical applications within the U.S. Through its\n80% ownership of Rose, the Company has a substantial presence in the Province of Quebec as a cannabis supplier, producer and\ncommercialization expert.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the\ninstructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain information and\nfootnote disclosures normally included in the annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of\nDecember 31, 2023 is derived from the Company’s audited financial statements as of that date. Because certain information and\nfootnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncontained in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In management’s opinion, all normal and recurring\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the\nperiods presented have been included. When necessary, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the\ncurrent period presentation. Interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any\nother interim period or for the full fiscal year. The Company believes that the disclosures made in these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are adequate to make the information not misleading.\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include Village Farms International, Inc. and its subsidiaries\nand include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable,\nentities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. Other parties’ interests in entities that the Company consolidates are reported as non-\ncontrolling interests within equity, except for mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests, which are recorded within\nmezzanine equity. Net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests is reported as a separate line item below net\nincome or loss. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which it does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest, but over which it has the ability to exert significant influence. For equity investees in which the\nCompany has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities and profits or losses of an unconsolidated entity, but does not\nexercise control over the entity, the Company consolidates its proportional interest in the accounts of the entity.\nTranslations of Foreign Currencies\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at period-end exchange rates, with resulting translation gains or losses included within other comprehensive income or\nloss. Revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange during the applicable period.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s foreign operations use their local currency as their functional currency. For foreign\noperations for which the local currency is not the functional currency, the operation’s non-monetary assets are remeasured into\nU.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. All other accounts are remeasured at current exchange rates, with both gains or losses\nfrom remeasurement and currency gains or losses from transactions executed in currencies other than the functional currency\nincluded in foreign exchange (loss) gain.\n6\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nIn these condensed consolidated financial statements, “$” means U.S. dollars and \"C$\" means Canadians dollars, unless\notherwise noted.\nRevision of Prior-Period Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn connection with the preparation of our third quarter 2024 condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the Company\nidentified an immaterial misstatement in its estimate of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance as of the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nAs a result, we recorded a decrease to deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and increase in income tax expense for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 for $3,000, which decreased total assets and retained earnings as of December 31, 2023 and\nincreased our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 by $3,000.\nOur revision had no impact to the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. Additionally, our revision had no impact to\nthe Company’s segment profit measure, compliance with debt covenants, or performance metrics used in the calculation of\nexecutive compensation as the impacted line items are excluded from these calculations.\nWe evaluated the materiality of the impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior\nperiods.\nGeneral Economic, Regulatory and Market Conditions\nThe Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, direct and indirect negative effects on its business and\noperations from negative economic, regulatory and market conditions, including inflationary effects on fuel prices, labor and\nmaterials costs, elevated interest rates, potential recessionary impacts and supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect\ndemand for new projects and/or delay existing project timing or cause increased project costs. The extent to which general\neconomic, regulatory and market conditions could affect the Company’s business, operations and financial results is uncertain as\nit will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, and, therefore, any future\nimpacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with\nspecificity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNo accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2.

The Company's ownership\ninterest in Rose is now 80%.\n5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nCannabis - Canada Cannabis - United States Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 $ 45,879 $ 10,039 $ 55,918\nImpairments - (10,039) (10,039)\nForeign currency translation\nadjustment (883) - (883)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 44,996 $ - $ 44,996\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consisted of the following as of:\nClassification September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLicenses $ 18,351 $ 18,540\nBrand and trademarks* 12,727 12,795\nCustomer relationships 13,324 13,586\nComputer software 2,037 1,974\nOther* 144 144\nLess: Accumulated amortization (9,840) (7,414)\nLess: Impairments* (9,249) (7,350)\nIntangibles, net $ 27,494 $ 32,275\n* Includes indefinite-lived intangible assets\nThe expected future amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 was as follows:\nFiscal period\nRemainder of 2024 $ 838\n2025 3,267\n2026 3,178\n2027 3,178\n2028 1,884\nThereafter 11,527\nIntangibles, net $ 23,872\nAssessment for Indicators of Impairment\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that\nwould indicate an impairment. The Company considers external and internal factors, including overall financial performance\nand relevant entity-specific factors, as part of this assessment.\n8\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing for\nimpairment indicators for the Company’s U.S. and Canadian Cannabis segments.\nCannabis - U.S.\nAt June 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators, it concluded that the\nCompany's U.S. - Cannabis segment more likely than not was impaired. The Company reviewed the reportable segment's assets,\nincluding goodwill and intangible assets. Based on recent historical performance during the quarter which underperformed\nrelative to budget, a revised June 30, 2024 forecast which resulted in a shortfall compared to the March 31, 2024 forecast, the\nnew restrictions on CBD sales in an additional eight states at July 1, 2024, and the proliferation of unregulated hemp-derived\nproducts on the market which continues to challenge market share for the CBD industry, the Company concluded that as of June\n30, 2024, the fair value of the brand intangible asset and goodwill was fully impaired and an impairment charge to goodwill of\n$10,039 and a charge to intangibles of $1,900 was allocated to the U.S. Cannabis reporting unit.\nCannabis - U.S. - Goodwill\nThe fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection using projections for the\nremainder of 2024 to 2028 with an average revenue growth rate of 6% between 2025 to 2028, followed by a terminal growth\nrate of 2%. Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying amount and as a result,\nan impairment charge to goodwill of $10,039 was recorded to the reporting unit.\nThe significant assumptions applied to the determination of the fair value are described below:\nPost-tax discount rate: A market participant post-tax discount rate applied to the after-tax forecast cash flows was 12%. A\ndecrease of 1% to the discount rate, would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nTerminal growth rate: An increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would not result in a material change to the impairment\ncharge.\nFuture cash flows: An increase in future cash flows by 10% would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nCannabis – U.S. Brand\nThe fair value of the brand was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection. Specifically, the Company utilized a\nrelief from royalty valuation technique to arrive at the fair value of the brand. Management concluded that as of June 30,\n2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying value of $1,900 as the notional brand maintenance costs exceeded the\n9\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nincremental royalty of 3.5%. Therefore, an impairment charge to the brand intangible of $1,900 was allocated to the reporting\nunit.\nCannabis - Canada\nAt September 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators for Canadian\nCannabis, it concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely\nthan not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred\nthat would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\n6. LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT\nThe following table provides details for the carrying values of debt as of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm Loan - (\"FCC Loan\") - repayable by monthly principal payments\nof $164 and accrued interest at a rate of 8.81%; matures May 3, 2027 $ 21,312 $ 22,788\nTerm Loan - Pure Sunfarms - C$19.0M - Canadian prime interest rate\nplus an applicable margin, repayable in quarterly payments equal to\n2.50% of the outstanding principal amount, interest rate of 8.45%;\nmatures February 7, 2026 7,028 8,298\nTerm loan - Pure Sunfarms - C$25.0M - Canadian prime interest rate\nplus an applicable margin, repayable in quarterly payments equal to\n2.50% of the outstanding principal amount, interest rate of 8.45%;\nmatures February 7, 2026 11,560 13,201\nBDC Facility - Pure Sunfarms - non-revolving demand loan repayable\nby monthly principal payments of C$52 and accrued interest at a rate of\n10.20%, matures December 31, 2031 3,353 3,771\nTotal $ 43,253 $ 48,058\nThe Company’s line of credit with Bank of Montreal (\"Operating Loan\") had $4,000 drawn on the facility as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe carrying value of the assets and securities pledged as collateral for the FCC Loan as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was $74,942 and $117,293, respectively.\nThe carrying value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Operating Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nwas $23,233 and $28,034, respectively.\nThe Pure Sunfarms line of credit had a balance of $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company is required to comply with financial covenants, measured either quarterly or annually depending on the covenant.\nThe Company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nThe weighted average annual interest rate on short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was\n9.21% and 9.44%, respectively.\nAccrued interest payable on all long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $405 and $390,\nrespectively, and these amounts are included in accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial\nPosition.\n10\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nThe aggregate annual principal maturities of long-term debt for the remainder of 2024 and thereafter are as follows:\nRemainder of 2024 $ 1,440\n2025 5,759\n2026 16,856\n2027 17,348\n2028 462\nThereafter 1,388\nTotal\n$ 43,253\n7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, minority investments, line of credit,\ntrade payables, accrued liabilities, lease liabilities, note payables and debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,\ntrade receivables, trade payables, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these\nfinancial instruments. The carrying value of line of credit, lease liabilities, notes payable, and debt approximate their fair values\ndue to insignificant changes in credit risk. Carrying amounts of other long-term financial instruments, excluding the Company's\nterm loans, approximate fair value, since the instruments bear interest at variable or fixed rates which approximate market rates.\nFor its investments, the Company has selected the practicability election to fair value measurement, under which the investment\nis measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes of an identical or similar investment.\n8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nThe Company leases its Rose office building from a Company employee who also owns a minority interest in Rose. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid C$40 and C$230, respectively and for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 the Company paid C$80 and C$172, respectively, to lease this office space.\nOne of the Company’s employees is related to a member of the Company’s executive management team and received\napproximately $45 and $130 in salary and benefits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nand $42 and $103 in salary and benefits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOn May 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Rose and non-controlling shareholders, which\nincludes two company employees, for the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in Rose for a total cash purchase price of\napproximately $3,016 (note 4).\n9. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company has recorded a provision for income taxes of ($94) and ($674) for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared with a recovery of (provision for) income taxes of $1,664 and ($269) for the same periods last\nyear.\nThe Company’s income tax provision is based on management’s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year. The tax\n(provision) benefit in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as discrete items, differences in the\ndeductibility of certain items, changes in the valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets, in addition to changes in tax\nlegislation. As a result, the Company may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense\ndivided by pre-tax book income) from period to period.\nIn order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years.\nThe Company analyzed all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more\nlikely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax\nbenefits is based upon the Company’s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on\ninformation currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts, and product introductions, as well as historical\noperating results and certain tax planning strategies.\nBased on the analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has concluded that it does not have the\nability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary periods to utilize the entire benefit for its deferred tax assets.\nAccordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of $48,742 as of September 30, 2024 and $42,530 as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of its deferred tax assets may\nbe deemed appropriate in the future.\n11\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s net deferred tax assets totaled $1,201 and were primarily derived from a tax planning\nstrategy to utilize a portion of its existing net operating loss carryforwards.\n10.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with\nour unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report and\nthe Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and consolidated financial statements\ncontained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our \"Annual Report on Form 10-K\"). This\ndiscussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties,\nand our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements. We encourage you to\nreview the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Part II,\nItem 1A of this Quarterly Report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or\nimplied by our forward-looking statements contained in this report. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this\nmanagement’s discussion and analysis, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking\nstatements, except as required by law.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nVillage Farms International, Inc. (“VFF”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Village Farms”, “we” “us” or\n“our”) is a corporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). The Company’s principal operating subsidiaries are\nVillage Farms Canada Limited Partnership (\"VFCLP\"), Village Farms L.P. (\"VFLP\"), Pure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms” or\n\"PSF\"), Balanced Health Botanicals, LLC (“Balanced Health”), Rose LifeScience Inc. (\"Rose LifeScience” or “Rose”), VF Clean\nEnergy, Inc. (“VFCE”), and Leli Holland B. V. (\"Leli\" or \"Leli Holland\").\nThe Company’s vision is to be recognized as an international leader in consumer products developed from plants, whereby\nwe produce and market value-added products that are consistently preferred by consumers. To do so, we leverage decades of\ncultivation expertise, investment, and experience in fresh produce into branded and wholesale cannabis products within markets with\nlegally permissible opportunities.\nIn Canada, we converted two produce facilities to grow cannabis for the Canadian legal adult use (recreational) market. Our\nfocus for our Canadian Cannabis segment is to produce high quality cannabis, leveraging our low-cost production to provide preferred\nproducts at an attractive price that address the preferred consumer segments in the market. This market positioning, combined with our\ncultivation expertise, has enabled us to evolve into the second best-selling producer nationally and one of the few Canadian licensed\nproducers with consistently strong operating results.\nAdditionally, through organic growth, exports and/or acquisitions, we have a strategy to participate in other international\nmarkets where cannabis attains legal status. In September 2021, our Canadian Cannabis business began exporting cannabis products to\nAustralia for that country’s medical market. In March 2022, our Canadian Cannabis business received European Union Good\nManufacturing Practice (“EU GMP”) certification for Pure Sunfarms’ 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 cannabis facility located in\nDelta, British Columbia (“B.C.”) which permits Pure Sunfarms to export EU GMP-certified medical cannabis to importers and\ndistributors in international markets that require EU GMP certification. In late 2022, Pure Sunfarms commenced exports to Israel and\nin 2023, Pure Sunfarms began exporting cannabis products to Germany and the United Kingdom for the medical markets in those\ncountries. As a result of the typically higher margins in international medical markets, we expect international expansion to enhance\nour profitability while expanding our brand and experience into emerging legal cannabis markets.

Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in\nevaluating the performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance. Adjusted\nEBITDA includes the Company’s 70% interest in Rose LifeScience through March 31, 2024, 80% interest in Rose LifeScience beginning on April 1,\n2024, 85% interest in Leli through September 22, 2024, and our 100% interest in Leli beginning on September 23, 2024.\nCANADIAN CANNABIS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe Canadian Cannabis segment consists of Pure Sunfarms and Rose LifeScience.

The increase of $7,653, or 27%, was due primarily to a 18% increase in net branded sales\nand a 66% increase in non-branded sales. The increase in net branded sales was due to market share gain across the flower, pre-roll\nand milled categories, driven by successful new product launches, the expansion of a rapidly growing brand, and rising demand for\nvalue-based product offerings. The increase in non-branded sales resulted from improved industry supply dynamics and pricing\nsupported by a shift of many producers toward asset-light models and sales of non-brand-spec inventory. International sales increased\nby 94% primarily due to higher sales to Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\nThe Canadian Cannabis business continues to pay a burdensome excise duty (also known as excise tax) on its branded sales\n(sales to provincial distributors).

The increase of $7,058, or 20%, was primarily due to a 25% increase in pounds sold from Company-\nowned greenhouses and a 6% increase in volume from supply partners. The increase in sales from Company-owned greenhouses of\n25% was due to additional production from the Delta 2 facility, which was partially converted to produce in 2024. This was partially\noffset by the Permian Basin facility not being used for production in 2024.\nThe average selling price for all produce sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was as follows: tomatoes changed (1%), peppers changed 33%, cucumbers changed 5%, and mini\ncucumbers changed (1%).\nCost of Sales\nVF Fresh cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $5,069, or 15%, to ($39,289) compared\nwith ($34,220) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

For additional information, refer to the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss)\nincome in “Non-GAAP Measures—Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA”.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSales\nVF Fresh sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $125,883, compared with $114,125 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase in sales of $11,758, or 10%, was primarily due to an increase of 12% in pounds sold and an\nincrease in supply partner average selling price, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price from Company-owned\ngreenhouses.\nThe average selling price for all produce sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was as follows: tomatoes changed (3%), peppers changed 23%, cucumbers changed (6%) and mini\ncucumbers changed (11%).\nCost of Sales\nVF Fresh cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $8,477, or 7%, to ($123,256) compared\nwith ($114,779) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase from supply partners of\n$7,895, and an increase from Company-owned greenhouses of $1,104, partially offset by a decrease of lower freight expenses of $522.\nThe increase in supply partner costs is due to a 8% increase in pounds sold. The increase in Company-owned greenhouse costs was\ndue to a 15% increase in pounds sold partially offset by a lower cost per pound. The decrease in freight costs is due to increased\navailable drivers and decreases in fuel prices.\nGross Profit (Loss)/Margin\nVF Fresh gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2,627 compared with a gross loss of ($654) for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2% compared with (1%) for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvements in both gross profit and gross margin percentage were due to an\nincrease from Company-owned greenhouse sales, an increase in supply partner sales, a decrease from Company-owned greenhouse\ncost per pound, and a decrease in freight costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nVF Fresh selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1,160, or\n15%, to ($8,996) (7% of sales) compared with ($7,836) (7% of sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher\nconsulting, accounting, and legal fees.\nNet Loss\nVF Fresh net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was ($7,810) compared with a net loss of ($4,268) for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the ToBRFV Legal Settlement of $5,584 during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 that was not present in current-year period, partially offset by an increase in sales and improved\nmargins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nVF Fresh Adjusted EBITDA decreased to ($1,991) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $1,110 for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the ToBRFV Legal Settlement of\n$5,584 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by the improved gross margin for the reasons identified\nabove. For additional information, refer to the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income in “Non-GAAP Measures—\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA”.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nAt September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $28,696 and working capital was $65,441, compared with cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash of $35,291 and working capital of $79,612 at December 31, 2023. We believe that our existing cash,\ncash generated from our operating activities and the availability under our Operating Loan and Pure Sunfarms Loans (each as defined\nbelow), will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, repayments of our long-term debt and future\ncontractual obligations and fund our planned capital expenditures for the next 12 months. An additional potential source of liquidity is\naccess to capital markets for additional equity or debt financing. We intend to use our cash on hand for daily operational funding\nrequirements.\n27\nOutstanding as of\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars unless otherwise\nnoted) Maximum Availability September 30, 2024\nOperating Loan $ 8,556 $ 4,000\nFCC Term Loan $ 21,312 $ 21,312\nPure Sunfarms Loans C$ 29,656 $ 21,940\nPure Sunfarms Revolving Line of\nCredit C$ 15,000 $ —\nThe Company’s borrowings under the FCC Term Loan (as defined below) and the Operating Loan (as defined below)\n(collectively the “Credit Facilities”) are subject to certain positive and negative covenants, including debt ratios, and the Company is\nrequired to maintain certain minimum working capital.

In addition, we present below\n“Adjusted EBITDA – Constant Currency” which excludes the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. See “—Constant Currency”\nbelow. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency are measures of operating performance that are not recognized\nunder GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, these non-GAAP measures may not be\ncomparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that our non-GAAP measures should not be\nconstrued as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our performance. Our non-\nGAAP measures are used as additional measures to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our segments. Management\nbelieves that our non-GAAP measures are important measures in evaluating the historical performance of the Company because it\nexcludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by the Company:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (820) $ (1,299) $ (27,221) $ (9,315)\nAdd:\nAmortization 4,204 3,195 11,911 9,384\nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss (363) 929 754 196\nInterest expense, net 662 708 1,996 2,724\nProvision for (recovery of) income taxes 94 (1,664) 674 269\nProvision for income taxes attributable to non-\ncontrolling interest (6) — (156) —\nShare-based compensation 858 690 3,402 2,973\nInterest expense for NCI's (85) 13 (116) 47\nAmortization for NCI's 738 603 2,070 1,762\nForeign currency exchange gain for NCI's 4 3 9 5\nShare-based compensation for NCI's 16 39 58 113\nOther expense, net for NCI's — (14) 4 (29)\nDeferred financing fees — 34 10 102\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairments (1) — — 11,939 —\nOther expense, net — 11 — 12\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) $ 5,302 $ 3,248 $ 5,334 $ 8,243\n(1) Reflects impairment to goodwill and intangibles of $11,939 in U.S. Cannabis that was based on recent historical performance, near-term forecasts, and the\nstate of the CBD industry in the United States.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this\nQuarterly Report should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe tables below set forth certain measures of consolidated results from continuing operations on a constant currency basis\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 on an as\nreported and constant currency basis (in thousands):\nAs Reported As Adjusted for Constant Currency\nFor the Three\nFor the Three Months Ended Months Ended Constant Currency\nSeptember 30, As Reported Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 $ %\nSales $ 83,368 $ 69,510 $ 13,858 20% $ 85,276 $ 15,766 23%\nCost of sales (67,660) (54,889) (12,771) (23%) (69,072) (14,183) (26%)\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses (16,540) (15,822) (718) (5%) (16,947) (1,125) (7%)\nOther (expense) income, net 176 (1,716) 1,892 110% 165 1,881 110%\nOperating loss (656) (2,917) 2,261 78% (578) 2,339 80%\nLoss including non-controlling\ninterests (750) (1,253) 503 40% (687) 566 45%\nNet loss (820) (1,299) 479 37% (763) 536 41%\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant\nCurrency (2) 5,302 3,248 2,054 (63%) 5,529 2,281 (70%)\n32\nAs Reported As Adjusted for Constant Currency\nFor the Nine Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended Constant Currency\nSeptember 30, As Reported Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 $ %\nSales $ 253,627 $ 211,378 $ 42,249 20% $ 254,864 $ 43,486 21%\nCost of sales (213,158) (172,958) (40,200) (23%) (214,072) (41,114) (24%)\nSelling, general and\nadministrative expenses (52,593) (49,980) (2,613) (5%) (52,856) (2,876) (6%)\nOther (expense) income, net (2,250) 2,520 (4,770) 189% (2,256) (4,776) 190%\nGoodwill and intangible asset\nimpairments (1) (11,939) — (11,939) (11,939) (11,939) 0%\nOperating (loss) income (26,313) (9,040) (17,273) (191%) (26,259) (17,219) (190%)\nLoss including non-controlling\ninterests (26,987) (9,309) (17,678) (190%) (26,943) (17,634) (189%)\nNet loss (27,221) (9,315) (17,906) (192%) (27,181) (17,866) (192%)\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant\nCurrency (2) 5,334 8,243 (2,909) 35% 5,485 (2,758) 33%\n(1) Reflects impairment to goodwill and intangibles of $11,939 in U.S. Cannabis that was based on recent historical performance, near-term forecasts, and\nthe state of the CBD industry in the United States. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments” below for more information.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency is not a recognized earnings measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore,\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency presented for these segments may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company\nbecause it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect the underlying business performance of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nNo accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Interim Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are included in Part I of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nAs described in Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial\nStatements included in Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing for impairment indicators for the Company’s U.S. and Canadian\nCannabis segments. As part of this assessment, the Company considered both external and internal factors, including overall financial\nperformance and outlook.\nCannabis - U.S.\nAt June 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators it concluded that the\nCompany's U.S. - Cannabis segment more likely than not was impaired. The Company reviewed the reporting segment's assets,\nincluding goodwill and intangible assets. Based on recent historical performance during the quarter which underperformed relative to\nbudget, a revised June 30, 2024 forecast which resulted in a shortfall compared to the March 31, 2024 forecast, the new restrictions on\nCBD sales in an additional eight states at July 1, 2024, and the proliferation of unregulated hemp-derived products on the market\nwhich continues to challenge market share for the CBD industry, the Company concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value of\nthe brand intangible asset and goodwill was fully impaired and an impairment charge to intangibles of $1,900 and goodwill of $10,039\nwas recorded to the U.S. Cannabis reporting unit.\nCannabis - U.S. - Goodwill\nAt June 30, 2024, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection using projections for\n2024 to 2028 with an average revenue growth rate of 6% between 2025 to 2028, followed by a terminal growth rate of 2%.\n33\nManagement concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying amount and as a result, an impairment\ncharge to goodwill of $10,039 was recorded to the reporting unit.\nThe significant assumptions applied to the determination of the fair value are described below:\nPost-tax discount rate: A market participant post-tax discount rate applied to the after-tax forecast cash flows was 12%. A decrease of\n1% to the discount rate, would not result in material change to the impairment charge.\nTerminal growth rate: An increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nFuture cash flows: An increase in future cash flows by 10% would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nCannabis – U.S. Brand\nThe fair value of the brand was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection. Specifically, the Company utilized a relief\nfrom royalty valuation technique to arrive at the fair value of the brand. Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value\nwas lower than its carrying value of $1,900 as the notional brand maintenance costs exceeded the incremental royalty of 3.5%.\nTherefore, an impairment charge to the brand intangible of $1,900 was allocated to the reporting unit.\nCannabis - Canada\nAt September 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators for Canadian Cannabis it\nconcluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely than not, reduce the\nfair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that\nwould, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual\nresults could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any\nreasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\n34\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, our variable interest rate debt was primarily related to our Credit Facilities and Term Loans.\nOutstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and Term Loans bear interest at either the (a) Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”) or (b) Canadian Prime Rate, as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, we had\napproximately $4,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving loans under our Operating Loan with an interest rate of\n7.8% and we had approximately $43,253 in aggregate principal amounts of our Term Loans with a weighted average interest rate of\n8.8%. The current interest rates for outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Facility and Term Loans reflect basis point increases\nof approximately 0.9% over the comparable period in 2023.\nOur interest expense is affected by the overall interest rate environment. Our variable rate interest debt subjects us to risk\nfrom increases in prevailing interest rates. This risk increases in the current inflationary environment, in which the Federal Reserve\nhas increased interest rates, resulting in an increase in our variable interest rates and related interest expense. An additional 50 basis\npoint increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility and Term Loan would have increased our interest expense by\napproximately $57 and $171 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $65 and $131 for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nWhile we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the significance of the impact that interest rate movements\nwill have on our existing debt, management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Canadian/U.S. foreign exchange rate was C$1.00 = US$0.7398 and C$1.00 =\nUS$0.7363, respectively. If all other variables remain constant, an increase of $0.10 in the Canadian dollar would have the following\nimpact on the ending balances of certain statements of financial position items at September 30, 2024 and 2023 with the net foreign\nexchange gain or loss directly impacting net income (loss):\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,426 $ 1,659\nTrade receivables 3,303 2,958\nPrepaid and deposits 238 573\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade payables and accrued liabilities (4,023) (5,842)\nLoan payable (3,019) (3,549)\nNet foreign exchange gain $ (75) $ (4,201)\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk and the impact of foreign exchange rates are monitored by the Company’s\nmanagement but generally the Company tries to match its sales (trade receivables) and vendor payments (trade payables) such that the\nnet impact is not material.\nOther than the interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk discussed above, there have been no material changes to our market\nrisks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that,\nas of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material\nweakness described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\n35\nyear ended December 31, 2023, which has not been fully remediated as of September 30, 2024, as well as the following material\nweakness identified during the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\nWe identified a material weakness in our risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting that resulted\nin a failure to effectively design and implement sufficient internal controls related to our information technology general controls\n(“ITGCs”) in the areas of user access and program change-management over the information technology (“IT”) system that is utilized\nto support the Produce segment’s financial reporting processes. Specifically, under our existing ITGCs, we determined that there were\ninsufficient controls to limit user access to this system and to enable oversight of changes being made to the financial inputs under this\nsystem. As a result, business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on and use information produced from the\naffected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted by any inappropriate user access or\nfinancial input changes.\nNotwithstanding the identification of the foregoing material weakness, we are not aware of any such inappropriate user\naccess or financial input changes. Accordingly, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to our financial\nstatements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results.\nRemediation Plan and Status\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to implement a remediation plan to improve the\noperation of its controls over the review of the determination of the fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets, as previously\ndescribed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2023. Management is also in the process of designing\ncontrols to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the ITCG material weakness described above are remediated, such that\nthese controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively. These remediation actions are ongoing and included or are\nexpected to include:\n• Enhancing risk assessment and control identification procedures for our Produce segment’s system environment;\n• Enhancing existing controls and/or applying other appropriate procedures to address the design and operation of IT\ngeneral controls within our Produce segment’s system environment in order to, among other things, limit user access; and\n• Implementing monitoring controls around timely identification and review of system changes.\nAs we continue to evaluate and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional\nmeasures to address the material weaknesses or adjustments to the remediation plan may be required. Once controls are designed and\nimplemented, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to\nconsider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, has\nreviewed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), other than continuing to address the material weaknesses described\nabove, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\n36\nPART II. – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Business\nVillage Farms International, Inc. (“VFF” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a\ncorporation existing under the Ontario Business Corporations Act. VFF’s principal operating subsidiaries as of June 30, 2024\nwere Village Farms Canada Limited Partnership, Village Farms, L.P., Pure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms”), Balanced Health\nBotanicals, LLC (“Balanced Health”) and VF Clean Energy, Inc. (\"VFCE\"). VFF also owns an 80% interest in Rose\nLifeScience Inc. (“Rose”) and an 85% interest in Leli Holland B.V. (\"Leli\").\nThe address of the registered office of VFF is 4700-80th Street, Delta, British Columbia, Canada, V4K 3N3.\nThe Company’s shares are listed on Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “VFF”.\nVillage Farms owns and operates sophisticated, highly intensive agricultural greenhouse facilities in British Columbia and\nTexas, where it produces, markets and sells premium-quality tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers. Its wholly owned\nsubsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is a vertically integrated Licensed Producer (\"LP\") and supplier of cannabis products sold to\ncustomers throughout Canada and internationally. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Balanced Health, develops and\nsells high-quality, cannabidiol (“CBD”) based products including ingestible, edible and topical applications within the U.S.\nThrough its 80% ownership of Rose, the Company has a substantial presence in the Province of Quebec as a cannabis supplier,\nproducer and commercialization expert.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the\ninstructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain information and\nfootnote disclosures normally included in the annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of\nDecember 31, 2023 is derived from the Company’s audited financial statements as of that date. Because certain information and\nfootnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncontained in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In management’s opinion, all normal and recurring\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the\nperiods presented have been included. When necessary, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the\ncurrent period presentation. Interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any\nother interim period or for the full fiscal year. The Company believes that the disclosures made in these consolidated financial\nstatements are adequate to make the information not misleading.\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include Village Farms International, Inc. and its subsidiaries\nand include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable,\nentities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. Other parties’ interests in entities that the Company consolidates are reported as non-\ncontrolling interests within equity, except for mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests, which are recorded within\nmezzanine equity. Net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests is reported as a separate line item below net\nincome or loss. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which it does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest, but over which it has the ability to exert significant influence. For equity investees in which the\nCompany has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities and profits or losses of an unconsolidated entity, but does not\nexercise control over the entity, the Company consolidates its proportional interest in the accounts of the entity.\nTranslations of Foreign Currencies\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.\ndollars at period-end exchange rates, with resulting translation gains or losses included within other comprehensive income or\nloss. Revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange during the applicable period.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s foreign operations use their local currency as their functional currency. For foreign\noperations for which the local currency is not the functional currency, the operation’s non-monetary assets are remeasured into\nU.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. All other accounts are remeasured at current exchange rates. Gains or losses from\nremeasurement are included in foreign exchange (loss) gain. Currency gains or losses resulting from transactions executed in\ncurrencies other than the functional currency are included in foreign exchange (loss) gain.\nIn these condensed consolidated financial statements, “$” means U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\n6\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\nGeneral Economic, Regulatory and Market Conditions\nThe Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, direct and indirect negative effects on its business and\noperations from negative economic, regulatory and market conditions, including recent inflationary effects on fuel prices, labor\nand materials costs, elevated interest rates, potential recessionary impacts and supply chain disruptions that could negatively\naffect demand for new projects and/or delay existing project timing or cause increased project costs. The extent to which general\neconomic, regulatory and market conditions could affect the Company’s business, operations and financial results is uncertain as\nit will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, and, therefore, any future\nimpacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with\nspecificity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNo accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024:\nCannabis - Canada Cannabis - United States Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 $ 45,879 $ 10,039 $ 55,918\nImpairments - (10,039) (10,039)\nForeign currency translation\nadjustment (1,419) - (1,419)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 $ 44,460 $ - $ 44,460\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consisted of the following as of:\nClassification June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLicenses $ 17,956 $ 18,540\nBrand and trademarks* 12,686 12,795\nCustomer relationships 13,165 13,586\nComputer software 2,026 1,974\nOther* 144 144\nLess: Accumulated amortization (8,858) (7,414)\nLess: Impairments (9,250) (7,350)\nIntangibles, net $ 27,869 $ 32,275\n* Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nThe expected future amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2024 was as follows:\nFiscal period\nRemainder of 2024 $ 1,639\n2025 3,192\n2026 3,104\n2027 3,104\n2028 1,861\nThereafter 11,389\nIntangibles, net $ 24,289\nAssessment for Indicators of Impairment\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that\nwould indicate an impairment. The Company considers external and internal factors, including overall financial performance\nand relevant entity-specific factors, as part of this assessment.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing for impairment\nindicators for the Company’s U.S. and Canadian Cannabis segments.\nCannabis - U.S.\nAt June 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators it concluded that the\nCompany's U.S. - Cannabis segment more likely than not was impaired. The Company reviewed the reporting segment's assets,\nincluding goodwill and intangible assets. Based on recent historical performance during the quarter which has underperformed\nrelative to budget, a revised June 30, 2024 forecast which shows a shortfall compared to the March 31, 2024 forecast, the new\nrestrictions on CBD sales in an additional eight states at July 1, 2024, and the proliferation of unregulated hemp-derived\nproducts on the market which continues to challenge market share for the CBD industry, the Company concluded that as of June\n8\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\n30, 2024, the fair value of the brand intangible asset and goodwill was fully impaired and an impairment charge to intangibles of\n$1,900 and goodwill of $10,039 was allocated to the U.S. Cannabis reporting unit.\nCannabis - U.S. - Goodwill\nThe fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection using projections for 2024 to\n2028 with an average revenue growth rate of 6% between 2025 to 2028, followed by a terminal growth rate of 2%. Management\nconcluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying amount and as a result, an impairment charge to\ngoodwill of $10,039 was allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe significant assumptions applied to the determination of the fair value are described below:\nPost-tax discount rate: A market participant post-tax discount rate applied to the after-tax forecast cash flows was 12%. A\ndecrease of 1% to the discount rate, would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nTerminal growth rate: An increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would not result in a material change to the impairment\ncharge.\nFuture cash flows: An increase in future cash flows by 10% would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nCannabis – U.S. Brand\nThe fair value of the brand was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection. Specifically, the Company utilized a\nrelief from royalty valuation technique to arrive at the fair value of the brand. Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024,\nthe fair value was lower than its carrying value of $1,900 as the notional brand maintenance costs exceeded the incremental\nroyalty of 3.5%. Therefore, an impairment charge to the brand intangible of $1,900 was allocated to the reporting unit.\nCannabis - Canada\nWhen the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators for Canadian Cannabis it concluded that\nno impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value\nof the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that\nwould, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\n6.

For its investments, the Company has selected the practicability election to fair value\nmeasurement, under which the investment is measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes of an\nidentical or similar investment.\n8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nThe Company leases its Rose office building from a company employee who also owns a minority interest in Rose. For the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid C$151 and C$190 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023\nthe Company paid C$47 and C$92, respectively, to lease this office space.\nOne of the Company’s employees is related to a member of the Company’s executive management team and received\napproximately $85 and $61 in salary and benefits during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn May 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Rose and non-controlling shareholders, which\nincludes two company employees, for the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in Rose for a total cash purchase price of\napproximately $3,016.\n9. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company has recorded a provision for income taxes of ($260) and ($580) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared with a provision for income taxes of ($1,299) and ($1,933) for the same periods last year.\nThe Company’s income tax provision is based on management’s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year. The tax\n(provision) benefit in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary, differences in the\ndeductibility of certain items, changes in the valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets, in addition to changes in tax\nlegislation. As a result, the Company may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense\ndivided by pre-tax book income) from period to period.\nIn order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years.\nThe Company analyzed all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more\nlikely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax\nbenefits is based upon the Company’s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on\n10\nVILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\n(In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted)\ninformation currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts, and product introductions, as well as historical\noperating results and certain tax planning strategies.\nBased on the analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has concluded that it does not have the\nability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary period to utilize the entire benefit for the deferred tax assets.\nAccordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of $45,571 as of June 30, 2024 and $39,530 as of December 31,\n2023. The Company cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of its deferred tax assets may be deemed\nappropriate in the future.\nIf the Company incurs future losses, it may be necessary to record additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax\nassets recognized as of June 30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company’s net deferred tax assets totaled $4,201 and were primarily derived from net operating loss\ncarryforwards.\n10.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with\nour unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report and\nthe Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and consolidated financial statements\ncontained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our \"Annual Report on Form 10-K\"). This\ndiscussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties,\nand our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements. We encourage you to\nreview the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Part II,\nItem 1A of this Quarterly Report. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or\nimplied by our forward-looking statements contained in this report. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this\nmanagement’s discussion and analysis, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking\nstatements, except as required by law.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nVillage Farms International, Inc. (“VFF”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Village Farms”, “we” “us” or\n“our”) is a corporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). The Company’s principal operating subsidiaries are\nVillage Farms Canada LP (\"VFCLP\"), Village Farms LP (\"VFLP\"), Pure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms” or \"PSF\"), Balanced\nHealth Botanicals, LLC (“Balanced Health”), Rose LifeScience Inc. (\"Rose LifeScience” or “Rose”), and VF Clean Energy, Inc.\n(“VFCE”).\nThe Company’s vision is to be recognized as an international leader in consumer products developed from plants, whereby\nwe produce and market value-added products that are consistently preferred by consumers. To do so, we leverage decades of\ncultivation expertise, investment, and experience in fresh produce into branded and wholesale cannabis products within markets with\nlegally permissible opportunities.\nIn Canada, we converted two produce facilities to grow cannabis for the Canadian legal adult use (recreational) market. Our\nfocus for our Canadian Cannabis segment is to produce high quality cannabis, leveraging our low-cost production to provide preferred\nproducts at an attractive price that address the preferred consumer segments in the market. This market positioning, combined with our\ncultivation expertise, has enabled us to evolve into the second best-selling producer nationally and one of the few Canadian LPs with\nconsistently strong operating results.\nAdditionally, through organic growth, exports and/or acquisitions, we have a strategy to participate in other international\nmarkets where cannabis attains legal status. In September 2021, our Canadian Cannabis business began exporting cannabis products to\nAustralia for that country’s medical market. In March 2022, our Canadian Cannabis business received European Union Good\nManufacturing Practice (“EU GMP”) certification for Pure Sunfarms’ 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 cannabis facility located in\nDelta, British Columbia (“B.C.”) which permits Pure Sunfarms to export EU GMP-certified medical cannabis to importers and\ndistributors in international markets that require EU GMP certification. In late 2022, Pure Sunfarms commenced exports to Israel and\nin 2023, Pure Sunfarms began exporting cannabis products to Germany and the United Kingdom for the medical markets in those\ncountries. As a result of the typically higher margins in international medical markets, we expect international expansion to enhance\nour profitability while expanding our brand and experience into emerging legal cannabis markets. Through our 85% ownership of Leli\nHolland, we hold one of ten licenses to cultivate cannabis legally in the Netherlands under that country’s Closed Supply Chain\nExperiment program, with production targeted to start in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn the U.S., Balanced Health is our industry-leading cannabinoid business, extending our portfolio into cannabidiol (“CBD”)\nconsumer products.\nWe also operate a large, well-established, produce business (primarily tomatoes) under the Village Farms Fresh (“VF Fresh”)\nbrand which sells to food distribution companies and mass retail stores. We own and operate produce cultivation assets in Texas and\nDelta, B.C. and source produce from our growing partners, in Mexico and Canada.\nOur intention is to use our assets, expertise and experience (across cannabis, CBD and produce) to participate in the U.S.\nCannabis market subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws and applicable stock exchange rules.\nOur Operating Segments\nCanadian Cannabis Segment\nOur Canadian Cannabis segment is comprised of Pure Sunfarms and an 80% ownership in Rose LifeScience.\n14\nPure Sunfarms is one of the single largest cannabis cultivation and processing operations in the world, one of the lowest-cost\ngreenhouse producers and has developed four of the best-selling flower brands in Canada. Pure Sunfarms leverages our 30 years of\nexperience as a vertically integrated greenhouse grower to grow, produce and sell cannabis products throughout Canada and for export\nto markets where permissible by law.\nRose is the second best-selling licensed producer of cannabis in the Province of Quebec, as well as a prominent cannabis\nproducts commercialization expert in Quebec, acting as the exclusive, direct-to-retail sales, marketing and distribution entity for some\nof the best-known brands in Canada, as well as Quebec-based micro and craft growers.\nOur long-term objective for our Canadian Cannabis segment is to garner and sustain the leading retail market share in Canada\nstemming from our leading position as the low-cost, high-quality cannabis producer in Canada and expand our Canadian success into\nthe growing foreign cannabis medicinal markets across the globe.\nU.S. Cannabis Segment\nOur U.S. Cannabis segment is comprised of Balanced Health.\nBalanced Health is one of the leading cannabinoid brands and e-commerce platforms in the United States. Balanced Health\ndevelops and sells high-quality CBD and hemp-based health and wellness products, distributing its diverse portfolio of consumer\nproducts through its top-ranked e-commerce platform, CBDistillery™ and third-party retailers.\nProduce Segment\nOur Produce segment is comprised of VF Fresh, which currently consists of Village Farms LP and Village Farms Canada LP.\nVF Fresh, grows, markets and distributes premium-quality, greenhouse-grown produce in North America. These premium\nproducts are grown in sophisticated, highly intensive agricultural greenhouse facilities located in British Columbia and Texas. We also\nmarket and distribute premium tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers produced under exclusive and non-exclusive arrangements from our\ngreenhouse supply partners located in Mexico, B.C. and Ontario. We primarily market and distribute under our Village Farms® brand\nname to retail supermarkets and dedicated fresh food distribution companies throughout the United States and Canada.\nEnergy Segment\nOur Energy segment is comprised of VF Clean Energy Inc.\nVFCE has partnered with Terreva Renewables (formerly Mas Energy) for the Delta RNG Project based on VFCE’s 20-year\ncontract (including a five-year option to extend) with the City of Vancouver to capture landfill gas at the Delta, B.C. landfill site (the\n\"Delta RNG Project\"). The Delta RNG Project, which commenced operations in 2024, converts VFCE’s previous landfill gas-to-\nelectricity business into a state-of-the-art landfill gas to high-demand renewable natural gas (\"RNG\") facility. Terreva Renewables\nsells the renewable natural gas and VFCE receives a portion of the revenue in the form of a royalty.\nRecent Developments and Updates\nCanadian Cannabis\n• Further expanded its number two national market share position1, further narrowing the gap to the number one position\nand achieving our highest national market share position to date;\n• Was the only LP among the top five to expand its national market share position sequentially1;\n• Further expanded its number one national market share position in dried flower1;\n• Expanded its number two national market share position in the pre-roll category1;\n• Continued to achieve steady market share gains in British Columbia (moving up two positions to be tied for the number\ntwo position) and Alberta (moving up four positions to the number four position) in the last year1;\n• The Supertoast brand was the third fastest growing brand nationally for the first half of 2024 with 20% market share in the\nmilled category nationally2, despite being sold in only four provinces;\n• Village Farms' SKUs held the number one position in the flower category during both the first and second quarters of\n20242;\n• Launched Hi-Def Pre-Rolls, a first-of-its-kind pre-roll, featuring pure ground flower optimized for high potency, with\nTHC content between 36-44%, with no concentrates, infusions or kief.\n1.For the second quarter of 2024.

Adjusted\nEBITDA includes the Company’s 70% interest in Rose LifeScience through March 31, 2024, 80% interest in Rose LifeScience beginning on April 1, 2024\nand 85% interest in Leli.\nWe caution that our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 may not be indicative of\nour future performance.\nDiscussion of Financial Results\nA discussion of our consolidated results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is included below.

The increase of $12,680, or 45%, was due primarily to a 32% increase in net branded sales and a 182%\nincrease in non-branded sales. The increase in net branded sales was due to market share gain across the flower, pre-roll and milled\ncategories, driven by high quality cultivation and new product launches. The increase in non-branded sales resulted from improved\nsupply conditions and pricing created by the shift of many producers to asset light models, including sales of non-brand-spec\ninventory. International sales increased by 9% primarily due to higher sales to Germany and UK, partially offset by lower sales to\nAustralia.\nThe Canadian Cannabis business continues to pay a burdensome excise duty (also known as excise tax) on its branded sales\n(sales to provincial distributors).

In\naddition, we present below and “Adjusted EBITDA – Constant Currency” which excludes the effect of foreign currency rate\nfluctuations. See “—Constant Currency” below. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency are measures of\noperating performance that are not recognized under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore,\nthese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that our\nnon-GAAP measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP as an\nindicator of our performance. Our non-GAAP measures are used as additional measures to evaluate the operating and financial\nperformance of our segments. Management believes that our non-GAAP measures are important measures in evaluating the historical\nperformance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect our business performance.\n28\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by the Company:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (23,549) $ (1,380) $ (26,401) $ (8,016)\nAdd:\nAmortization 3,988 2,946 7,707 6,190\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss) 346 (766) 1,117 (733)\nInterest expense, net 611 1,079 1,334 2,016\nProvision for income taxes 260 1,299 580 1,933\nProvision for income taxes attributable to non-\ncontrolling interest (51) — (150) —\nShare-based compensation 2,172 599 2,544 2,282\nInterest expense for JV's (23) 34 (31) 34\nAmortization for JVs 698 598 1,332 1,158\nForeign currency exchange gain for JVs 2 1 5 2\nShare-based compensation for JV's 19 40 42 74\nOther expense, net for JV's 29 (9) 4 (15)\nDeferred financing fees — 34 10 68\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairments (1) 11,939 — 11,939 —\nOther expense, net — — — 1\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) $ (3,559) $ 4,475 $ 32 $ 4,994\n(1) Reflects impairment to goodwill and intangibles of $11,939 in U.S. Cannabis that was based on recent historical performance, near-term forecasts, and the\nstate of the CBD industry in the United States.

Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA\npresented for these segments may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a\nuseful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company because it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect the\nunderlying business performance of the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Constant Currency\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented constant\ncurrency adjusted financial measures for sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative, other income (expense), operating\n(loss) income, loss from consolidated entities, net loss, and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nwhich are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing\nhow our underlying operations performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information,\ncurrent and comparative prior period income statement results in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S. dollars\nusing the average exchange rates from the three and six month comparative periods in 2023 rather than the actual average exchange\nrates in effect during the respective current periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in 2023. We have\nprovided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the performance of our segments without\ntaking into account the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report\nshould not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP.\nThe tables below set forth certain measures of consolidated results from continuing operations on a constant currency basis\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 on an as reported and\nconstant currency basis (in thousands):\nAs Reported As Adjusted for Constant Currency\nFor the Three Months For the Three Months Ended Constant Currency\nEnded June 30, As Reported Change June 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 $ %\nSales $ 92,182 $ 77,212 $ 14,970 19% $ 93,648 $ 16,436 21%\nCost of sales (82,934) (65,713) (17,221) (26%) (84,021) (18,308) (28%)\nSelling, general and\nadministrative expenses (19,666) (16,753) (2,913) (17%) (19,974) (3,221) (19%)\nOther (expense) income, net (941) 5,212 (6,153) 118% (954) (6,166) 118%\nGoodwill and intangible asset\nimpairments (1) (11,939) — (11,939) (11,939) (11,939) 0%\nOperating loss (23,298) (42) (23,256) (55371%) (23,240) (23,198) (55234%)\nLoss including non-\ncontrolling interests (23,558) (1,341) (22,217) (1657%) (23,511) (22,170) (1653%)\nNet loss (23,549) (1,380) (22,169) (1606%) (23,507) (22,127) (1603%)\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant\nCurrency (2) (3,559) 4,475 (8,034) 180% (3,392) (7,867) 176%\nAs Reported As Adjusted for Constant Currency\nFor the Six Months Ended For the Six Months Ended Constant Currency\nJune 30, As Reported Change June 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 $ %\nSales $ 170,259 $ 141,868 $ 28,391 20% $ 170,865 $ 28,997 20%\nCost of sales (145,498) (118,069) (27,429) (23%) (145,947) (27,878) (24%)\nSelling, general and\nadministrative expenses (36,053) (34,158) (1,895) (6%) (36,181) (2,023) (6%)\nOther (expense) income, net (2,426) 4,236 (6,662) 157% (2,431) (6,667) 157%\nGoodwill and intangible asset\nimpairments (1) (11,939) — (11,939) (11,939) (11,939) 0%\nOperating (loss) income (25,657) (6,123) (19,534) (319%) (25,633) (19,510) (319%)\nLoss including non-controlling\ninterests (26,237) (8,056) (18,181) (226%) (26,217) (18,161) (225%)\nNet loss (26,401) (8,016) (18,385) (229%) (26,383) (18,367) (229%)\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant\nCurrency (2) 32 4,994 (4,962) 99% 101 (4,893) 98%\n(1) Reflects impairment to goodwill and intangibles of $11,939 in U.S. Cannabis that was based on recent historical performance, near-term forecasts, and\nthe state of the CBD industry in the United States.

Therefore,\nAdjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency presented for these segments may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\n31\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA - Constant Currency is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company\nbecause it excludes non-recurring and other items that do not reflect the underlying business performance of the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nNo accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective have had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Interim Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are included in Part I of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nAs described in Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial\nStatements included in Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company considered qualitative factors in assessing for impairment indicators for the Company’s U.S. and Canadian Cannabis\nsegments. As part of this assessment, the Company considered both external and internal factors, including overall financial\nperformance and outlook.\nCannabis - U.S.\nAt June 30, 2024, when the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators it concluded that the\nCompany's U.S. - Cannabis segment more likely than not was impaired. The Company reviewed the reporting segment's assets,\nincluding goodwill and intangible assets. Based on recent historical performance during the quarter which has underperformed relative\nto budget, a revised June 30, 2024 forecast which shows a shortfall compared to the March 31, 2024 forecast, the new restrictions on\nCBD sales in an additional eight states at July 1, 2024, and the proliferation of unregulated hemp-derived products on the market\nwhich continues to challenge market share for the CBD industry, the Company concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value of\nthe brand intangible asset and goodwill was fully impaired and an impairment charge to intangibles of $1,900 and goodwill of $10,039\nwas allocated to the U.S. Cannabis reporting unit.\nCannabis - U.S. - Goodwill\nThe fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection using projections for 2024 to 2028 with\nan average revenue growth rate of 6% between 2025 to 2028, followed by a terminal growth rate of 2%. Management concluded that\nas of June 30, 2024, the fair value was lower than its carrying amount and as a result, an impairment charge to goodwill of $10,030\nwas allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe significant assumptions applied to the determination of the fair value are described below:\nPost-tax discount rate: A market participant post-tax discount rate applied to the after-tax forecast cash flows was 12%. A decrease of\n1% to the discount rate, would not result in material change to the impairment charge.\nTerminal growth rate: An increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nFuture cash flows: An increase in future cash flows by 10% would not result in a material change to the impairment charge.\nCannabis – U.S. Brand\nThe fair value of the brand was determined based on a discounted cash flow projection. Specifically, the Company utilized a relief\nfrom royalty valuation technique to arrive at the fair value of the brand. Management concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the fair value\nwas lower than its carrying value of $1,900 as the notional brand maintenance costs exceeded the incremental royalty of 3.5%.\nTherefore, an impairment charge to the brand intangible of $1,900 was allocated to the reporting unit.\nCannabis - Canada\nWhen the Company considered qualitative factors in assessing impairment indicators for Canadian Cannabis it concluded that no\nimpairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the\nreporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company concluded that no impairment indicators existed as no events or circumstances occurred that would,\nmore likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting units to be below their carrying amounts.\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual\nresults could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any\nreasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\n32\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of June 30, 2024, our variable interest rate debt was primarily related to our Credit Facilities and Term Loans.\nOutstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and Term Loans bear interest at either the (a) Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”) or (b) Canadian Prime Rate, as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin. As of June 30, 2024, we had\napproximately $4,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving loans under our Operating Loan with an interest rate of\n7.8% and we had approximately $44,419 in aggregate principal amounts of our Term Loans with a weighted average interest rate of\n9.1%. The current interest rates for outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Facility and Term Loans reflect basis point increases\nof approximately 0.9% over the comparable period in 2023.\nOur interest expense is affected by the overall interest rate environment. Our variable rate interest debt subjects us to risk\nfrom increases in prevailing interest rates. This risk increases in the current inflationary environment, in which the Federal Reserve\nhas increased interest rates, resulting in an increase in our variable interest rates and related interest expense. An additional 50 basis\npoint increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility and Term Loan would have increased our interest expense by\napproximately $58 and $116 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and $65 and $131 for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023.\nWhile we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the significance of the impact that interest rate movements\nwill have on our existing debt, management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Canadian/U.S. foreign exchange rate was C$1.00 = US$0.7310 and C$1.00 = US$0.7547,\nrespectively. If all other variables remain constant, an increase of $0.10 in the Canadian dollar would have the following impact on the\nending balances of certain statements of financial position items at June 30, 2024 and 2023 with the net foreign exchange gain or loss\ndirectly impacting net income (loss):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,847 $ 1,433\nTrade receivables 3,951 2,572\nPrepaid and deposits 285 965\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade payables and accrued liabilities (4,555) (5,776)\nLoan payable (3,153) (3,606)\nNet foreign exchange gain $ (625) $ (4,412)\nOur exposure to foreign exchange risk and the impact of foreign exchange rates are monitored by the Company’s\nmanagement but generally the Company tries to match its sales (trade receivables) and vendor payments (trade payables) such that the\nnet impact is not material.\nOther than the interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk discussed above, there have been no material changes to our market\nrisks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that,\nas of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material\nweakness described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\n33\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nAs of December 31, 2023, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using\nthe criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was not effective due to errors in the calculation of the fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets,\nwhich was subsequently modified, resulting in no change in management’s determination of the fair value of its goodwill and\nintangible assets but, based on the COSO criteria, has been deemed to be a material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting.\nRemediation Plan and Status\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company implemented remediation to improve the operation of its controls over\nthe review of the determination of the recoverable amount of its goodwill and intangible assets. The Company will continue to review,\noptimize and enhance its financial reporting controls and procedures to ensure the remediation measures are effective and controls are\noperating effectively. The Company expects implementation of its remediation plan by December 31, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, has\nreviewed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), other than to address the material weakness described in\nmanagement's report on internal control over financial reporting, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 (as described above) that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n34\nPART II. – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
