(NASDAQ - UNB) today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend. Consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.3 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.56 per share, for the same period in 2023, and $5.8 million, or $1.27 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $8.2 million, or $1.82 per share for the same period in 2023. The decrease in earnings for the comparison periods was primarily due to the impact of the previously announced strategic balance sheet repositioning executed during the third quarter. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Bank, executed the sale of $38.8 million in book value of its lower-yielding available-for-sale debt securities for a pre-tax realized loss of $1.3 million, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal assets were $1.52 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to $1.40 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $123.9 million, or 8.9%. Loan growth was the primary driver of the increase in total assets with total loans reaching $1.13 billion as of September 30, 2024 including $8.4 million in loans held for sale, compared to $1.03 billion as of September 30, 2023, with $6.5 million in loans held for sale. Asset quality remains strong with minimal past due loans and net recoveries of $5 thousand and $15 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nLoan demand has remained strong during the third quarter of 2024 with growth in the residential, commercial, and municipal portfolios, despite higher interest rates and low residential inventory. Qualifying residential loans of $76.1 million were sold during the first nine months of 2024 compared to sales of $54.2 million for the first nine months of 2023.\n\nTotal deposits were $1.17 billion as of September 30, 2024 and include $80.0 million of purchased brokered deposits compared to deposits of $1.22 billion as of September 30, 2023 with $153.0 million of purchased deposits. Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $230.7 million were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 compared to $90.7 million outstanding as of September 30, 2023. In addition to borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, $10.0 million in advances from the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program were outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company had total equity capital of $72.3 million and a book value per share of $15.98 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $49.2 million and a book value of $10.92 per share as of September 30, 2023. Total equity capital is reduced by accumulated other comprehensive loss as it relates to the fair market value adjustment for investment securities. Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30, 2024 was $26.8 million compared to $47.1 million as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Income Statement**\n\nConsolidated net income was $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 47.7%. The decrease in net income was comprised of the $1.3 million net loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities mentioned above, increases in credit loss expense of $564 thousand and noninterest expenses of $483 thousand, partially offset by increases of $282 thousand in net interest income, $431 thousand in noninterest income, and a decrease in income tax expense of $419 thousand.\n\nNet interest income was $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $282 thousand, or 3.1%. Interest income was $17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $14.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $2.4 million, or 15.8%, due to the larger earning asset base and higher interest rates on new loan volume. Interest expense increased $2.1 million to $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2023, due to utilization of higher cost wholesale funding, such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits, and customers seeking higher returns on their deposits.\n\nCredit loss expense of $425 thousand was recorded for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit of $139 thousand recorded for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in expense was to support loan growth during the period and was not due to a deterioration in credit quality. Management continues to assess the adequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses quarterly.\n\nNoninterest income, excluding the loss on the bond sale, was $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2023. Sales of qualifying residential loans to the secondary market for the third quarter of 2024 were $35.2 million resulting in net gains of $540 thousand, compared to sales of $24.7 million and net gains on sales of $336 thousand for the same period in 2023. Noninterest expenses increased $483 thousand, or 5.4%, to $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase during the comparison period was due to increases of $295 thousand in salaries and wages, $305 thousand in employee benefits, $46 thousand in occupancy expenses, $71 thousand in equipment expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $234 thousand in other expenses.\n\nIncome tax benefit was $123 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 a decrease of $419 thousand compared to income tax expense of $296 thousand for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the income tax benefit resulting from the $1.3 million loss on the bond sale.\n\n**Dividend Declared**\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share for the quarter payable November 7, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 26, 2024.\n\n**About Union Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nUnion Bankshares, Inc., headquartered in Morrisville, Vermont, is the bank holding company parent of Union Bank, which provides commercial, retail, and municipal banking services, as well as, wealth management services throughout northern Vermont and New Hampshire.

(NASDAQ - UNB) today announced results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend. Consolidated net income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $2.0 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.60 per share, for the same period in 2023, and $4.4 million, or $0.98 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5.7 million, or $1.26 per share for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal assets were $1.40 billion as of June 30, 2024 compared to $1.33 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $63.7 million, or 4.8%. Loan growth was the primary driver of the increase in total assets with total loans reaching $1.01 billion as of June 30, 2024 including $6.2 million in loans held for sale, compared to $940.2 million as of June 30, 2023, with $3.1 million in loans held for sale. Asset quality remains strong with minimal past due loans and net recoveries of $10 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nInvestment securities were $254.2 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $268.9 million at June 30, 2023. The Company classifies its investment portfolio as available-for-sale and is required to report balances at their fair market value. As a result of the fair market value adjustment, unrealized losses in the investment portfolio were $45.1 million as of June 30, 2024. The unrealized losses in the portfolio are due to the interest rate environment as current rates remain above the coupon rates on these securities resulting in fair market values less than current book values. The offset to recording the unrealized losses is an increase in deferred taxes included in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive losses included in total equity as discussed below.\n\nTotal deposits were $1.05 billion as of June 30, 2024 and include $65.0 million of purchased brokered deposits compared to deposits of $1.12 billion as of June 30, 2023 with $138.0 million of purchased deposits. Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $212.1 million were outstanding as of June 30, 2024 compared to $120.5 million outstanding as of June 30, 2023. In addition to borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, $35.0 million in advances from the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program were outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company had total equity capital of $64.0 million and a book value per share of $14.16 as of June 30, 2024 compared to $59.1 million and a book value of $13.10 per share as of June 30, 2023. Total equity capital is reduced by accumulated other comprehensive loss as it relates to the fair market value adjustment for investment securities. Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2024 was $35.2 million compared to $36.3 million as of June 30, 2023.\n\n**Income Statement**\n\nConsolidated net income was $2.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2.7 million for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $680 thousand, or 25.2%. The decrease in net income was comprised of a decrease in net interest income of $134 thousand and increases of $484 thousand in credit loss expense and $718 thousand in noninterest expenses, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income of $282 thousand, and a decrease of $374 thousand in income tax expense.\n\nNet interest income was $9.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $134 thousand, or 1.4%. Interest income was $16.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $2.7 million, or 19.9%, due to the larger earning asset base and higher interest rates on new loan volume. Interest expense increased $2.9 million to $7.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2023, due to utilization of higher cost wholesale funding, such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits, and customers seeking higher returns on their deposits.\n\nCredit loss expense of $388 thousand was recorded for the second quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit of $96 thousand recorded for the second quarter of 2023. Credit loss expense is determined quarterly based on the growth and mix of the loan portfolio along with management's risk assessment of each portfolio segment.\n\nNoninterest income was $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2023. Sales of qualifying residential loans to the secondary market for the second quarter of 2024 were $19.3 million resulting in net gains of $341 thousand, compared to sales of $17.8 million and net gains on sales of $306 thousand for the same period in 2023. Noninterest expenses increased $718 thousand, or 7.9%, to $9.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $9.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase during the comparison period was due to increases of $101 thousand in salaries and wages, $160 thousand in employee benefits, $62 thousand in occupancy expenses, $135 thousand in equipment expenses, and $260 thousand in other expenses.\n\nIncome tax expense was $61 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 a decrease of $374 thousand, or 86.1% compared to $435 thousand for the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in net income before tax, and increases in tax exempt income and low income housing tax credits related to investments in limited partnerships for low to moderate income housing projects.\n\n**Dividend Declared**\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share for the quarter payable August 1, 2024 to shareholders of record as of July 27, 2024.\n\n**About Union Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nUnion Bankshares, Inc., headquartered in Morrisville, Vermont, is the bank holding company parent of Union Bank, which provides commercial, retail, and municipal banking services, as well as wealth management services throughout northern Vermont and New Hampshire.
