Our wholly owned subsidiary, SensiML Corporation, completes the end-to-end solution portfolio with AI / ML software that accelerates AI at the edge/endpoint. For more information, visit [www.quicklogic.com/](http://www.quicklogic.com/).\n\nQuickLogic uses its website ([www.quicklogic.com/](http://www.quicklogic.com/)), the company blog (<https://www.quicklogic.com/blog/>), corporate Twitter account (@QuickLogic_Corp), Facebook page (<https://www.facebook.com/QuickLogic>), and LinkedIn page (<https://www.linkedin.com/company/13512/>) as channels of distribution of information about its products, its planned financial and other announcements, its attendance at upcoming investor and industry conferences, and other matters. Such information may be deemed material information, and QuickLogic may use these channels to comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, investors should monitor the Company's website and its social media accounts in addition to following the Company's press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nQuickLogic reports financial information in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP, but believes that non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in evaluating its operating results and comparing its performance to comparable companies. Accordingly, the Company excludes certain charges related to stock-based compensation, in calculating non-GAAP (i) income (loss) from operations, (ii) net income (loss), (iii) net income (loss) per share, and (iv) gross margin percentage. The Company provides this non-GAAP information to enable investors to evaluate its operating results in a manner like how the Company analyzes its operating results and to provide consistency and comparability with similar companies in the Company's industry.\n\nManagement uses the non-GAAP measures, which exclude gains, losses, and other charges that are considered by management to be outside of the Company's core operating results, internally to evaluate its operating performance against results in prior periods and its operating plans and forecasts. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are used to plan for the Company's future periods and serve as a basis for the allocation of the Company's resources, management of operations and the measurement of profit-dependent cash, and equity compensation paid to employees and executive officers.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by QuickLogic may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures and may not be calculated in the same manner as that of other companies. QuickLogic does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures alone or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial statements portion of this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our future profitability and cash flows, expectations regarding our future business and statements regarding the timing, milestones, and payments related to our government contracts, and actual results may differ due to a variety of factors including: delays in the market acceptance of the Company's new products; the ability to convert design opportunities into customer revenue; our ability to replace revenue from end-of-life products; the level and timing of customer design activity; the market acceptance of our customers' products; the risk that new orders may not result in future revenue; our ability to introduce and produce new products based on advanced wafer technology on a timely basis; our ability to adequately market the low power, competitive pricing and short time-to-market of our new products; intense competition by competitors; our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel; changes in product demand or supply; general economic conditions; political events, international trade disputes, natural disasters and other business interruptions that could disrupt supply or delivery of, or demand for, the Company's products; and changes in tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities.

Our wholly owned\nsubsidiary, SensiML Corporation, completes the end-to-end solution portfolio with AI / ML\nsoftware that accelerates AI at the edge/endpoint. For more information,\nvisit www.quicklogic.com/.\nQuickLogic uses its website (www.quicklogic.com/), the company blog\n(https://www.quicklogic.com/blog/), corporate Twitter account (@QuickLogic_Corp),\nFacebook page (https://www.facebook.com/QuickLogic), and LinkedIn page\n(https://www.linkedin.com/company/13512/) as channels of distribution of information about\nits products, its planned financial and other announcements, its attendance at upcoming\ninvestor and industry conferences, and other matters. Such information may be deemed\nmaterial information, and QuickLogic may use these channels to comply with its disclosure\nobligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, investors should monitor the Company's\nwebsite and its social media accounts in addition to following the Company's press releases,\nSEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nQuickLogic reports financial information in accordance with United States Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP, but believes that non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are helpful in evaluating its operating results and comparing its performance to\ncomparable companies. Accordingly, the Company excludes certain charges related to\nstock-based compensation, in calculating non-GAAP (i) income (loss) from operations,\n(ii) net income (loss), (iii) net income (loss) per share, and (iv) gross margin percentage. The\nCompany provides this non-GAAP information to enable investors to evaluate its operating\nresults in a manner like how the Company analyzes its operating results and to provide\nconsistency and comparability with similar companies in the Company's industry.\nManagement uses the non-GAAP measures, which exclude gains, losses, and other charges\nthat are considered by management to be outside of the Company's core operating results,\ninternally to evaluate its operating performance against results in prior periods and its\noperating plans and forecasts. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are used to plan for the\nCompany's future periods and serve as a basis for the allocation of the Company's\nresources, management of operations and the measurement of profit-dependent cash, and\nequity compensation paid to employees and executive officers.\nInvestors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by QuickLogic\nmay not be the same non-GAAP financial measures and may not be calculated in the same\nmanner as that of other companies. QuickLogic does not itself, nor does it suggest that\ninvestors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures alone or as a substitute for\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures to non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial statements\nportion of this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with their most\ndirectly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without\nlimitation, statements regarding our future profitability and cash flows, expectations\nregarding our future business and statements regarding the timing, milestones, and\npayments related to our government contracts, and actual results may differ due to a variety\nof factors including: delays in the market acceptance of the Company's new products; the\nability to convert design opportunities into customer revenue; our ability to replace revenue\nfrom end-of-life products; the level and timing of customer design activity; the market\nacceptance of our customers' products; the risk that new orders may not result in future\nrevenue; our ability to introduce and produce new products based on advanced wafer\ntechnology on a timely basis; our ability to adequately market the low power, competitive\npricing and short time-to-market of our new products; intense competition by competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel; changes in product demand or supply;\ngeneral economic conditions; political events, international trade disputes, natural disasters\nand other business interruptions that could disrupt supply or delivery of, or demand for, the\nCompany's products; and changes in tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThese and other potential factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from the results contemplated or implied are described in more detail in the\nCompany's public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"),\nincluding the risks discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section in the Company's Annual Reports\non Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the Company's prior press releases,\nwhich are available on the Company's Investor Relations website at http://ir.quicklogic.com/,\nand on the SEC website at www.sec.gov/.

The Company provides innovative, programmable silicon and software\nplatforms to enable its customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, QuickLogic is a fabless semiconductor\ncompany with a variety of products: embedded FPGA (\"eFPGA\") intellectual property (\"IP\"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips (\"SoCs\"), discrete\nFPGAs, and AI software. QuickLogic's customers can use its eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit\n(\"ASIC\") products, the Company's SoCs to run its customers' software and build their hardware around, and the Company's discrete FPGAs to implement their custom\nfunctionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML Corporation (\"SensiML\"), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence /\nMachine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of platforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and\nefficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor processing across Aerospace and Defense, Consumer/Industrial IoT, and Consumer Electronics markets.\nThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these statements have\nbeen prepared in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal\nrecurring adjustments, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The Company recommends that these interim unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 27, 2024. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full fiscal year.\nQuickLogic's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31 and each fiscal quarter ends on the Sunday closest to the end of each calendar quarter.\nQuickLogic's third fiscal quarter for 2024 and 2023 ended on September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has one reportable business segment based on how its Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") manages the business and in a manner\nconsistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. The CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), reviews detailed income statements, balance\nsheets, and sales reports in order to assess performance of the Company. Sales and operating income are some of the key variables monitored by the CODM and\nmanagement when determining the Company's consolidated financial condition and operating performance.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has financed its operations and capital investments through the sale of common stock, financing arrangements, operating leases, a revolving line\nof credit with Heritage Bank (the \"Revolving Facility\"), and cash flows from operations. As of September 29, 2024, the Company's principal sources of liquidity consisted\nof cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $22.4 million, inclusive of a $20.0 million advance from its Revolving Facility and $3.5 million in net proceeds from the\nCompany's sale of common stock in the nine months ended September 29, 2024. The Company's restricted cash balance as of September 29, 2024 was $0.1 million and\nrelates to amounts pledged as cash security for the use of credit cards.\nThe Company was in compliance with all the Revolving Facility loan covenants as of September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had $20.0\nmillion outstanding on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 8.50%.\nOn March 13, 2024, the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and their affiliated entities for the sale of\nan aggregate of 223 thousand shares of common stock, par value $0.001, in a registered direct offering, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 million.\nIssuance costs related to the offering were negligible. The purchase price for each share of common stock was $16.00. See Note 9 for additional information.\nOn March 21, 2023, the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 450 thousand shares\nof its common stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $2.3\nmillion. Issuance costs related to the offering were immaterial. The purchase price for each share of common stock in the Share Placement was $5.14.\nOn April 28, 2023, the Company converted accounts receivable for a customer in the amount of approximately $1.16 million to notes receivable (the \"Original\nNote\"). At the time, the Original Note bore an interest rate of 3.0% compounded monthly. On June 28, 2023, the Company cancelled the Original Note and entered into a\nrevised promissory note (\"Second Revised Note\") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to 4.69% compounded monthly, or a 4.8% effective annual interest\nrate, accruing from the date of the Original Note. On June 27, 2024, the Company cancelled the Second Revised Note and entered into a revised promissory note (\"Current\nNote\") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to 10.0% per annum. Accrued but unpaid interest will be compounded monthly, accruing from the date of the\nCurrent Note. Additionally, if not prepaid prior to the Current Note maturity date of the earlier of (i) 24 months from June 28, 2024 or (ii) the closing of the customer's\nSeries B financing, the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to the Company. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate will increase to\n15.31%. All other terms of the Note remained the same. As of September 29, 2024, the related note receivable balance was $1.26 million, including $97 thousand in accrued\ninterest.\nThe Company currently uses its cash to fund its working capital, to accelerate the development of next generation products, and for general corporate purposes.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with $3.5 million gross cash proceeds from\nthe March 13, 2024 financing, its revenues from operations, and the available financial resources from the Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank will be sufficient to fund\nits operations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months.\n7\nTable of Contents\nVarious factors affect the Company’s liquidity, including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor\nindustry; the conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on the Company's ArcticLink® and\nPolarPro® platforms, ArcticPro™, EOS S3 SoC, Quick AI solution, QuickAI™, SensiML Analytics Toolkit, Eclipse II products, and eFPGA IP license and professional\nservices; the timing, milestones, and payments related to our government contracts; fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a\nresult of the stage in the product life cycle of its customers’ products; costs of securing access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories;\nwafer purchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of research and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production\nvolumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of its investment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or\nrenew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit facilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the Company; the issuance\nand exercise of stock options and participation in the Company’s employee stock purchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global\neconomics.\nOver the longer term, the Company anticipates that sales generated from its new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial\nresources from its Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank, assuming renewal of the Revolving Facility or the Company entering into a new debt agreement with an\nalternative lender prior to the expiration of the revolving line of credit on December 31, 2025, and its ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be\nsufficient to satisfy its operations and capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or\nthat such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The inability of the Company to generate sufficient sales from its new product offerings and/or raise\nadditional capital if needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition, including its ability to maintain compliance with its\nlender’s financial covenants.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QuickLogic and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company's non-U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical exchange rates.\nIncome and expense elements are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency\ntransactions of these subsidiaries are recorded as interest income and other expense, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, and are\ninsignificant for all periods presented.\nUses of Estimates\nThe preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in\nits consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition\nand results of operations and requires it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently\nuncertain.\nAlthough these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately\nmaterially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, inventory\nvaluation, including the identification of excess quantities, market value, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. The Company\nbelieves that it applies judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes that fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements. For additional information, please refer to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on\nMarch 27, 2024.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Company's accounts receivable and note receivable are denominated in U.S. dollars and are derived primarily from sales to customers located in North\nAmerica, Asia Pacific, and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. See Note 12, Information\nConcerning Product Lines, Geographic Information and Revenue Concentration, for information regarding concentrations associated with accounts receivable.\nAs of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $20.0 million of revolving debt outstanding with Heritage Bank; the revolving debt\ncarried an interest rate of 8.50% per annum and 9.00% per annum, respectively. Heritage Bank has a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's\ntangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the agreement. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants under the agreement as of\nthe end of the current reporting period. The maturity date for advances under the revolving debt agreement is December 31, 2025. At September 29, 2024, the Company had\nutilized a significant portion of the revolving debt, and as a result, it maintains a substantial amount of cash deposits with Heritage Bank. The concentration of cash with one\nfinancial institution poses certain risks.\n8\nTable of Contents\nFor instance, adverse developments affecting financial institutions, companies in the financial services industry, or the financial services industry, such as\nactual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance, could adversely impact the stability of Heritage Bank, leading to additional financial risks for\nthe Company.\nAny material decline in available funding or the Company's ability to access its cash, cash equivalents, and liquidity resources, inclusive of those at Heritage\nBank, could adversely impact its ability to meet its operating expenses, financial and contractual obligations, or result in breaches of its contractual obligations. Any of these\nimpacts could have material adverse impacts on the Company's operations and liquidity.\nNote 2 — Significant Accounting Policies\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, there were no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from its disclosures in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of the significant accounting policies, please see the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.\nCertain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nFurther, certain prior period disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements have been modified to conform with current period presentation.\nIn the nine months ended September 29, 2024, there we no observable indicators of impairment for the non-marketable equity investment. Furthermore,\nutilizing the probability-of-default method to determine the current expected credit loss for the Company's note receivable, the Company determined the associated current\nexpected credit loss to be de minimis as of September 29, 2024.\nFinancing Arrangements, Non-Cash Activities, & Correction of an Error\nThe Company previously classified certain licensed tooling software as leased assets and liabilities under ROU assets and financing lease liabilities pursuant to\nlease accounting under ASC 842, Leases. Upon further analysis, the Company determined these amounts are intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with\nASC 350, Intangibles, Goodwill, and Other and financed through financing arrangements. As a result, the Company corrected immaterial errors to revise its consolidated\nstatement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. Cash payments on notes payable during the nine months ended October 1, 2023 were $0.5 million,\ninstead of presented as payments of finance lease obligations. Proceeds from notes payable during the nine months ended October 1, 2023 were $0.1 million, instead of\nincreases in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. Additionally, $0.5 million was added to the depreciation and amortization adjustment for amortization of\nsoftware tools financed through financing arrangements for the nine months ended October 1, 2023.\nConforming the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 to the Company's reclassification at fiscal year\n2023 year-end of certain assets from property and equipment to internal-use software resulted in the reclassification of investing cash outflows from capital expenditures to\ninternal-use software in the amount of $0.3 million.\nAdditionally, non-cash activities of $0.3 million related to deferred charges were removed from the consolidated statement of cash flows. Purchases of assets\nwith financing arrangements were $0.6 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023.\nThe Company has determined the correction of these errors did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, including net income and\nthe balance of accumulated deficit as of and for the nine months ended October 1, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual\nSale Restrictions to clarify the measurement of the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and requires\ndisclosures related to these types of equity securities. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made\navailable for issuance. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 on January 1, 2024 and it had no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or\nrelated disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures by providing information to better assess how an entity's operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational\nopportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The adoption of this ASU is not expected\nto have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Disclosures About Reportable Segments to enhance\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses, among other interim disclosure requirements. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to\nhave a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 — Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share was computed by dividing net income (loss) available by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe period. Diluted net income (loss) per share was computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive\ncommon shares outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method. In computing diluted net income (loss) per share, the weighted average stock price for the\nperiod is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and warrants. For periods in which the Company has\nreported a net loss, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as dilutive\ncommon shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company has reported a net income, diluted net income per\nshare attributable to common stockholders is different from basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders as dilutive common shares would increase the\namount of shares outstanding reduced by the amounts of treasury shares repurchased from the proceeds at the average market price for the period.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and the nine months ended October 1, 2023, 892 thousand and 925 thousand shares of common\nstock, respectively, associated with equity awards and the estimated number of shares to be purchased under the current offering period of the 2009 Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan were outstanding. These shares were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share, as they were considered anti-dilutive due to the net losses\nthe Company experienced during this period. Warrants to purchase up to 386 thousand shares that were issued in connection with the May 29, 2018, stock offering were not\nincluded in the diluted loss per share calculation of the periods presented as they were also considered anti-dilutive due to the net loss the Company experienced during\nthese periods. The warrants were exercisable through May 29, 2023 at a price of $19.32 per share. The warrants expired unexercised on May 29, 2023.\nFor the three months ended October 1, 2023, 925 thousand shares of common stock associated with equity awards and the estimated number of shares to be\npurchased under the current offering period of the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan were outstanding. Of these, a 276 thousand share equivalent was determined to be\ndilutive and included in the computation of diluted net income per share for the period. Estimated proceeds for the dilutive shares were determined to be $147 thousand,\nwhich resulted in a reduction of dilutive shares by 4,672 using the treasury stock method at an average market price of $8.41.\nNote 4 — Balance Sheet Components\nThe following table provides details relating to certain balance sheet line items as of September 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, December 31,\n2024 2023\nInventories, net:\nWork-in-process $ 1,438 $ 1,602\nFinished goods 342 427\n$ 1,780 $ 2,029\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nPrepaid taxes $ 522 $ 498\nDeferred charges 999 290\nDeferred cost of sales 586 2\nOther prepaid taxes, royalties, and other prepaid expenses 632 627\nOther 180 144\n$ 2,919 $ 1,561\nProperty and equipment, net:\nEquipment $ 9,613 $ 10,503\nSoftware tools 3,009 2,163\nTooling 12,437 7,085\nSoftware 1,776 1,803\nFurniture and fixtures 58 65\nLeasehold improvements 647 580\n27,540 22,199\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (13,403) (13,251)\n$ 14,137 $ 8,948\nCapitalized internal-use software, net:\nCapitalized internal-use software $ 4,316 $ 3,491\nLess: Accumulated amortization (1,964) (1,422)\n$ 2,352 $ 2,069\nIntangible assets, net:\nIntangible assets $ 1,156 $ 1,156\nLess: Accumulated amortization (699) (619)\n$ 457 $ 537\nAccrued liabilities:\nAccrued compensation $ 649 $ 1,910\nAccrued employee benefits 181 57\nAccrued payroll tax 141 197\nOther 486 509\n$ 1,457 $ 2,673\n10\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, work-in-process (\"WIP\") inventories, net consist primarily of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively,\nof die wafers and $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of tested, unmarked devices held for sale, which are completed upon customer orders.\nThe Company capitalized $5.35 million in pre-production design and development costs as tooling to be utilized under its long-term professional services\ncontracts for the nine months ended September 29, 2024. $3.6 million in pre-production design and development costs were capitalized as tooling for the nine months\nended October 1, 2023.

We provide innovative, programmable silicon and software platforms to\nenable our customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, we are a fabless semiconductor company with a\nvariety of products: embedded FPGA (\"eFPGA\") intellectual property (\"IP\"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips (\"SoCs\"), discrete FPGAs, and AI\nsoftware. Our customers can use our eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products, our SoCs to\nrun our customers' software and build their hardware around, and our discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML\nCorporation (\"SensiML\"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI\ntechnology. The full range of platforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor processing across Aerospace and\nDefense, Consumer/Industrial IoT, and Consumer Electronics markets.\nOur new products include the following: eFPGA IP Licensing business and associated professional services, consisting of development and integration of\neFPGA technology into custom semiconductor solutions and our silicon products consisting of EOS™, QuickAI™, ArcticLink® III, PolarPro®3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and\nEclipse II products. In addition to delivering our own semiconductor solutions, our new products category includes our AI/ML Software Platform from our wholly-owned\nsubsidiary company, SensiML, which includes Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions for development, per unit license fees when deployed in production, and proof-of-\nconcept services, all of which are also included in the new products revenue category. Our mature products include primarily FPGA families named PASIC®3 and\nQuickRAM®, as well as programming hardware and design software. We currently have a total of four patent applications pending.\nFor our IP and silicon platforms, we collaborate with multiple partners on co-marketing and/or co-selling initiatives. These partners could have primary\nbusiness lines in semiconductor IP, Design Services, semiconductor foundry, semiconductor assembly and test, and others. For our AI/ML Software, SensiML collaborates\nwith several microcontroller and sensor manufacturers to integrate the microcontroller and/or sensor manufacturers’ development kits with SensiML’s Analytics Toolkit in\norder to showcase combined solutions for AI/ML applications. Currently, these collaborations include Infineon Technologies, On Semiconductor Corp., Microchip\nTechnology Inc., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Arduino, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Raspberry Pi, and Nordic Semiconductor.\nOur eFPGA IP is currently developed on 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, 28nm, 40nm, 65nm, 90nm, 130nm, and 250nm process nodes with a roadmap to more advanced\nnodes. The licensable IP is generated by our automated compiler tool called Australis™, which enables our engineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can\nthen integrate into their SoC without significant involvement by QuickLogic. We believe this flow enables a scalable development and support model for QuickLogic. For\nour eFPGA strategy, we typically work with semiconductor manufacturing partners prior to this IP being licensed to a SoC company.\nWe have changed our manufacturing strategies to reduce the cost of our silicon solution platforms to enable their use in a range of unique products ranging\nfrom low to high volume. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, QuickAI, and ArcticLink III silicon platforms combine mixed signal physical functions and hard-wired logic alongside\nour field programmable logic. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, and ArcticLink III solution platforms are manufactured on process nodes where we can benefit from smaller die\nsizes and lower power consumption. We typically implement sophisticated logic blocks and mixed signal functions in hard-wired logic because it is very cost-effective and\nenergy efficient. We use small form factor packages, which are less expensive to manufacture and include smaller pin counts. Reduced pin counts result in lower costs for\nour customers' printed circuit board space and routing. Furthermore, our SRAM reprogrammable silicon platforms can be programmed in-system by our customers, and\ntherefore, we do not incur programming costs, lowering the overall cost of ownership to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in silicon solution platforms and\nmanufacturing technologies that make us competitive for the variety of markets and applications that programmable logic serves.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, including existing new product platforms and\nplatforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven mainly by eFPGA IP and our silicon solutions, with additional contributions from SensiML\nAI Software. Therefore, our revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sale, and\nmarketing of our new solution platforms, IP, and software.\nWe market our programmable logic (FPGAs and eFPGA IP) solutions primarily to Defense Industrial Base contractors, U.S. Government entities, System\nOEMs, and fabless semiconductor companies. These customers may value one or more of our product categories. A solution can be based on our programmable technology,\nwhich enables customized designs, low power, flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market, and lower total cost of ownership. We are capable of providing\ncomplete solutions because of our investment in developing the low power IP and software required to implement specific functions, along with sensor software algorithms\noptimized for our architecture. In some cases, we develop the IPs and either software or firmware ourselves and, in other cases, we utilize third parties to develop the mixed\nsignal physical layers, logic, and/or software.\nWe market our SoC and SensiML solutions to OEMs and ODMs offering differentiated Consumer/IoT products, to processor vendors wishing to expand their\nserved available market, and to sensor manufacturers and sensor processing software companies wishing to expand their ecosystems. Our target markets for our SoC and\nSensiML products include Consumer/Industrial IoT and Consumer Electronics.\nBy using our silicon platforms, our IPs, our software, and our in-depth architecture knowledge, we can deliver energy efficient custom solutions that blend the\nbenefits of traditional ASSPs with the flexibility, product proliferation, differentiation, and low total cost of ownership advantages of programmable logic.\nWe monetize our technology through hardware product sales and eFPGA IP licenses, with any necessary corresponding work delivered via professional\nengineering services, SensiML Analytics Toolkit subscriptions, and per unit royalties. We specialize in enhancing the user experience in leading edge IoT hardware products.\nFor our customers, we enable hardware and sensor algorithmic differentiation quickly, cost-effectively, and at low power. For our partners, we expand their reach into new\nsegments and new use cases, thereby expanding the served available market for their existing hardware products.\nOur embedded FPGA technology gives ASIC and SoC developers the benefit of flexibility to make design changes post-manufacturing changes at very fast\ntime-to-and time-in-market, while keeping power consumption low. Our multi-core sensor processing products such as ArcticLink 3 S1, ArcticLink 3 S2, EOS 3, EOS S3\nLV, and EOS S3AI provide an extremely power-efficient approach for real-time multi-modal (vision, motion, voice, location, biometric, and environmental) sensor\nprocessing independently of the cloud. Our SensiML Analytics Toolkit is cutting-edge software that enables ultra-low power IoT endpoints that implement AI to transform\nraw sensor data into meaningful insight at the device itself. The toolkit also provides an end-to-end development platform spanning data collection, labeling, algorithm and\nfirmware auto generation, and testing.\nWe recognize that our markets require a range of solutions, and we intend to work with market-leading companies to combine silicon solution platforms,\npackaging technology, FPGA User Tools, sensor software algorithms, software drivers and firmware, to meet the product proliferation, high bandwidth, time-to-market,\ntime-in-market, and form factor requirements of our customers. We intend to continue to define and implement compelling solutions for our target customers and partners.\nWe believe our solutions are resonating with our target customers who value lower power consumption, platform design flexibility, rapid time-to-market,\nlonger time-in-market, and low total cost of ownership available through the use of our solutions.\nWe sell our products through a network of sales managers in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in San Jose,\nCalifornia, we have international sales operations in Japan and the United Kingdom. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and\napplication support for a given region, focusing on major strategic accounts, and managing our channel sales partners such as distributors.\nCustomers typically order our products through our distributors. Currently, we have 11 active distributors in the United States and a network of 18 active\ndistributors and sales representatives throughout Europe and Asia to support our international business. eFPGA IP customers and SensiML SaaS subscribers typically enter\ninto licensing agreements directly with QuickLogic and SensiML, respectively.\nWe also have an Aerospace and Defense, industrial, and IoT product customer base that purchases our mature silicon products. We expect to continue to offer\nsilicon hardware products to these customers, as well as new eFPGA IP for when these customers choose to implement their own silicon platform solution.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we generated total revenue of $4.3 million, an increase of 4% compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of 36% compared\nto the same quarter last year. Our new product revenue in the third quarter was $3.5 million, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 42% from the third\nquarter of 2023. Our mature product revenue was $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 31% compared to the prior quarter, and an\nincrease of 29% compared to the third quarter of 2023. We expect our mature product revenue to continue to fluctuate over time.\nWe devote substantially all of our development, sales, and marketing efforts to our new eFPGA IP licensing and professional services and SensiML initiatives.\nOverall, we reported a net loss of $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in the prior quarter and a net income of $1.2 million for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nAs of September 29, 2024, we had one operating lease with a remaining lease term of 2.67 years. The operating lease relates to our company headquarters in\nSan Jose, CA.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe methodologies, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our\nconsolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and\nresults of operations and requires us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, inventory valuation, including the identification of excess quantities, market\nvalue, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. We believe that we apply judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that\nsuch consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or\nerrors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our financial statements. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, there were no\nchanges in our critical accounting policies from our disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the\nSEC on March 27, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods\nindicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, September 29,\n2024 October 1, 2023 2024 October 1, 2023\nRevenue 100% 100% 100% 100%\nCost of revenue 44% 23% 41% 36%\nGross profit 56% 77% 59% 64%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 46% 29% 34% 37%\nSelling, general and administrative 54% 29% 47% 42%\nIncome (loss) from operations (44)% 19% (22)% (15)%\nInterest expense (4)% (1)% (2)% (1)%\nInterest income and other income (expense), net (1)% —% —% (1)%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (49)% 18% (24)% (17)%\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes —% —% 1% —%\nNet income (loss) (49)% 18% (25)% (17)%\nThree Months Ended September 29, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended October 1, 2023\nRevenue\nThe table below sets forth the changes in revenue in the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 1, 2023 (in\nthousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nNew products $ 3,537 83% $ 6,096 91% $ (2,559) (42)%\nMature products 736 17% 569 9% 167 29%\nTotal revenue $ 4,273 100% $ 6,665 100% $ (2,392) (36)%\nNote: For all periods presented, new products include hardware products and related revenues manufactured on 180 nanometer or smaller semiconductor processes,\nintellectual property license, professional services, QuickAI and SensiML AI software as a service (SaaS) revenue.

The increase resulted primarily from decreases in\nprofessional services eFPGA revenues and revenues from sales of new devices, partially offset by increases in revenues from sales of mature devices.\nNew Product Revenue\nThe table below sets forth the changes in new product revenue in the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 1,\n2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nHardware products $ 28 1% $ 248 3% $ (220) (89)%\neFPGA IP and professional services 3,445 81% 5,838 88% (2,393) (41)%\nSaaS & Other 64 1% 10 0% 54 540%\nTotal new product revenue $ 3,537 83% $ 6,096 91% $ (2,559) (42)%\n18\nTable of Contents\neFPGA IP revenue for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 was $3.4 million and $5.8 million, respectively, which were primarily\nprofessional services revenue.\nGross Profit\nThe table below sets forth the changes in gross profit for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 1, 2023 (in\nthousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nRevenue $ 4,273 100% $ 6,665 100% $ (2,392) (36)%\nCost of revenue 1,888 44% 1,537 23% 351 23%\nGross profit $ 2,385 56% $ 5,128 77% $ (2,743) (53)%\nIn the third quarter of 2024, gross profit decreased $2.7 million, or 53%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The net decrease in gross profit\nreflects a 36% decrease in revenues, combined with a 23% net increase in cost of revenue. Revenue decreased from the same quarter in the prior year due to the timing of\nDepartment of Defense contracts. The net increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the increased activity commensurate with the professional services revenue\ncontracts. Labor and increased depreciation expenses from capitalized tooling substantially comprised this increase, with slight offsets from decreased consulting and\nsoftware expenses.\nOur semiconductor products have historically had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories.\nHowever, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter, and the risk of\nobsolescence will increase. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers.\nOperating Expenses\nThe table below sets forth the changes in operating expenses for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 1,\n2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nR&D expense $ 1,954 46% $ 1,933 29% $ 21 1%\nSG&A expense 2,292 54% 1,915 29% 377 20%\nTotal operating expenses $ 4,246 100% $ 3,848 58% $ 398 10%\nResearch and Development\nOur R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel, overhead and other costs associated with System on Chip (SoC) and software development, programmable\nlogic design, AI and eFPGA development. R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter in 2023 were essentially flat, reflecting continued\nallocation of R&D resources to COGS for revenue contracts with customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance,\nadministration, human resources, and general management. The $0.4 million increase in SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of\n2023, was attributable primarily to increases in compensation.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe table below sets forth the changes in interest expense and interest income and other income (expense), net, for the three months ended September 29, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended October 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended Change\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 Amount Percentage\nInterest expense $ (186) $ (48) $ 138 288%\nInterest income and other income (expense), net (34) (36) (2) (6)%\nTotal interest (expense), interest income and other income (expense), net $ (220) $ (84) $ 136 162%\nInterest expense relates primarily to our revolving line of credit facility and notes payable. Interest income and other income (expense), net, relates to net\nforeign exchange losses recorded, partially offset by interest earned in our money market accounts. Changes in interest expense are related to our revolving loan's interest\nrate variability. Interest expense for the third quarter of this year as compared to the same period in the prior year increased approximately $138 thousand, which was\ncomprised of a $21 thousand increase in interest expense related to notes payable, a $119 thousand increase in interest expense and facility fees related to our revolving line\nof credit facility, and a $1 thousand decrease in interest expense related to IT hardware financing costs. Interest income and other income (expense), which is mostly\ncomprised of bank fees, net foreign exchange losses, and refunds, remained essentially flat.\n19\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe table below sets forth the changes in the provisions for income taxes in the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the three months ended\nOctober 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThree Months Ended Change\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 Amount Percentage\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes $ 13 $ 4 $ 9 225%\nThe Company recorded a net income tax expense of $13 thousand for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and a net income tax expense of $4\nthousand for the three months ended October 1, 2023. The effective tax rate benefit for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 was (0.60)% as compared to 0.20% for\nthe same period in the prior year.\nNine Months Ended September 29, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended October 1, 2023\nRevenue\nThe table below sets forth the changes in revenue in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023 (in\nthousands, except percentage data):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nNew products $ 11,470 80% $ 11,384 83% $ 86 1%\nMature products 2,937 20% 2,335 17% 602 26%\nTotal revenue $ 14,407 100% $ 13,719 100% $ 688 5%\nNote: For all periods presented, new products include hardware products and related revenues manufactured on 180 nanometer or smaller semiconductor processes,\nintellectual property license, professional services, QuickAI and SensiML AI software as a service (SaaS) revenue. Mature products include all products produced on\nsemiconductor processes larger than 180 nanometer.\nProduct revenue for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 increased $0.7 million. The increase resulted primarily from increases in\nSaaS IP revenues and revenue from devices and royalties.\nNew Product Revenue\nThe table below sets forth the changes in new product revenue in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 1,\n2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nHardware products $ 1,028 7% $ 776 6% $ 252 32%\neFPGA IP and professional services 10,009 69% 10,505 77% (496) (5)%\nSaaS & Other 433 4% 103 —% 330 320%\nTotal new product revenue $ 11,470 80% $ 11,384 83% $ 86 1%\neFPGA IP revenue for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 was $10.0 million and $10.5 million, respectively, which were\nprimarily professional services revenue.\nGross Profit\nThe table below sets forth the changes in gross profit for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023 (in\nthousands, except percentage data):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nRevenue $ 14,407 100% $ 13,719 100% $ 688 5%\nCost of revenue 5,934 41% 4,998 36% 936 19%\nGross profit $ 8,473 59% $ 8,721 64% $ (248) (3)%\nIn the third quarter of 2024, gross profit decreased $0.2 million, or 3%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit reflects a\n19% net increase in cost of revenue, partially offset by a 5% increase in revenues. Revenue increased from the same quarter in the prior year due to increases in SaaS IP\nrevenues and revenue from devices and royalties. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the increased activity commensurate with the professional services\nrevenue contracts. Contract manufacturing and outside services related to revenue contracts with customers substantially comprised this increase.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur semiconductor products have historically had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories.\nHowever, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter, and the risk of\nobsolescence will increase.

R&D expenses remained essentially flat in the nine months ending September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the\nprior year, which was primarily due to continued allocations of R&D resources to costs of revenues resulting from labor and tooling costs attributable to professional\nservices revenue contracts with customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance,\nadministration, human resources, and general management. The $1.0 million increase in SG&A expenses in the nine months ending September 29, 2024 as compared to the\nsame period in the prior year, was primarily attributable to increases in equity and compensation expenses.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe table below sets forth the changes in interest expense and interest income and other income (expense), net, for the nine months ended September 29, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nNine Months Ended Change\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 Amount Percentage\nInterest expense $ (295) $ (156) $ 139 89%\nInterest income and other expense, net (22) (99) (77) (78)%\nTotal interest (expense), interest income and other income (expense), net $ (317) $ (255) $ 62 24%\nInterest expense relates primarily to our revolving line of credit facility and notes payable. Interest income and other income (expense), net, relates to net\nforeign exchange losses recorded, partially offset by interest earned in our money market accounts. Changes in interest expense are related to our revolving loan's interest\nrate variability. Interest expense for the second quarter of this year as compared to the same period in the prior year increased approximately $139 thousand, which was\ncomprised of an $28 thousand increase in interest expense related to notes payable, a $113 thousand increase in interest expense related to our revolving line of credit\nfacility, and a $2 thousand decrease in interest expense related to IT hardware financing costs. The favorable change in interest income and other income (expense), net\nreflects accrued interest receivable related to note receivables with offsets related to slight increase in foreign exchange losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe table below sets forth the changes in the provisions for income taxes in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the nine months ended\nOctober 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nNine Months Ended Change\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 Amount Percentage\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes $ 14 $ 4 $ 10 250%\nThere was a slight increase in the income tax expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023.\nThe computed tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was (0.40%) as compared to (0.13%) for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The difference\nbetween the estimated annual effective income expense of 0% and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% is primarily due to the Company's valuation allowance\nmovement in each period presented. It is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets as of September 29,\n2024. As such, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of its US and certain foreign net deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2024. The\nprojected annual effective tax rate before certain discrete items as of the third quarter of 2024 is 0%, as compared to the projected annual effective tax rate of 2.67% for the\nsame period in the prior year.\n21\nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Activities\nBalance sheet amounts at September 29, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 resulted from typical and usual activities in the normal course of business.\nTotal assets increased by approximately $1.9 million, primarily due to the capitalization of $7.8 million in property, plant, and equipment and internal-use\nsoftware assets and a $1.4 million increase in other current assets, partially offset by $2.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense, a $2.2 million reduction in\ncash and cash equivalents due to payment of trade payables, a $2.2 million reduction in accounts receivable and contract assets due to the billing and collection of\noutstanding receivables, and a $0.2 million reduction in inventory.\nLiabilities decreased by approximately $2.1 million due to payment of trade payables of $1.8 million, accrued liabilities of $1.2 million, and debt and lease\nobligations of $1.1 million, as well as the recognition of deferred revenue of $0.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase of $2.6 million in notes payable due to\nthe purchase of additional software assets through financing arrangements. Equity increased $4.0 million due to a $7.5 million increase in additional paid in capital arising\nfrom the sale of shares of common stock and recognition of stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $3.5 million net loss for the nine months ended September 29,\n2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations and capital investments through public and private offerings of our common stock, financing arrangements, operating leases,\nborrowings under a revolving line of credit, and cash flows from operations. In addition to our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $22.4 million, as of September\n29, 2024, other sources of liquidity included a $20.0 million drawn down from our revolving line of credit (\"Revolving Facility\") with Heritage Bank of Commerce\n(“Heritage Bank”), and $3.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock on March 13, 2024. Costs related to the offering were immaterial. Our restricted\ncash balance as of September 29, 2024 was $0.1 million and relates to amounts pledged as cash security for the use of credit cards.\nOn April 28, 2023, we converted accounts receivable for a customer in the amount of approximately $1.16 million to notes receivable (the \"Original Note\"). At\nthe time, the Original Note bore an interest rate of 3.0% compounded monthly. On June 28, 2023, we cancelled the Original Note and entered into a revised promissory note\n(\"Second Revised Note\") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to 4.69% compounded monthly, or a 4.8% effective annual interest rate, accruing from the date\nof the Original Note. On June 27, 2024, we cancelled the Second Revised Note and entered into a revised promissory note (\"Current Note\") with the customer, where the\ninterest rate changed to 10.0% per annum. Accrued but unpaid interest will be compounded monthly, accruing from the date of the Current Note. Additionally, if not prepaid\nprior to the Current Note maturity date of the earlier of (i) 24 months from June 28, 2024 or (ii) the closing of the customer's Series B financing, the principal and all\naccrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to us. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate will increase to 15.31%. All other terms of the Note remained the\nsame. As of September 29, 2024, the related note receivable balance was $1.26 million, including $97 thousand in accrued interest.\nOn March 13, 2024, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and their affiliated entities for the sale of an\naggregate of 223 thousand shares of common stock, par value $0.001, in a registered direct offering, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 million. Issuance\ncosts related to the offering were negligible. The purchase price for each share of common stock was $16.00. See Note 9 for additional information.\nOn March 21, 2023, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 450 thousand shares of common\nstock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $2.3 million. Issuance\ncosts related to the offering were immaterial. The purchase price for each share of common stock in the Share Placement was $5.14.\nWe were in compliance with all the Heritage Bank Revolving Facility loan covenants as of September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, we had $20.0\nmillion outstanding on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 8.50%.\nWe currently use our cash to fund our working capital, to accelerate the development of next-generation products, and for general corporate purposes. Based on\npast performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with $3.5 million gross cash proceeds from the March 13,\n2024 financing, our revenues from operations, and the available financial resources from the Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank will be sufficient to fund our\noperations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months.\nVarious factors affect our liquidity, including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry;\nthe conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on our ArcticLink® and PolarPro®\nplatforms, ArcticPro™, EOS S3 SoC, Quick AI solution, QuickAI™, SensiML Analytics Toolkit, Eclipse II products, and eFPGA IP license and professional services; the\ntiming, milestones, and payments related to our government contracts; fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a result of the\nstage in the product life cycle of our customers’ products; costs of securing access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories; wafer\npurchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of research and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production\nvolumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or\nrenew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit facilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the company; the issuance\nand exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics.\nOver the longer term, we anticipate that sales generated from our new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial resources\nfrom our Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank, assuming renewal of the Revolving Facility or us entering into a new debt agreement with an alternative lender prior to the\nexpiration of the revolving line of credit in December 2025, and our ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our operations\nand capital expenditures. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such capital will be available on\nterms acceptable to us. The inability to generate sufficient sales from our new product offerings and/or raise additional capital if needed could have a material adverse effect\non our operations and financial condition, including our ability to maintain compliance with our lender’s financial covenants.\nAs of September 29, 2024, most of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were invested in a money market account at Heritage Bank. As of September\n29, 2024, our interest-bearing debt consisted of $3.1 million outstanding under notes payable and $20.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Facility. See Note 7, Debt\nObligations, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more details.\nCash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $0.1 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Earnings from our foreign\nsubsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate\nour liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors that affect our global capital deployment\nstrategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions\nand divestitures, and capital market conditions.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (89) $ (191)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (4,961) (2,445)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 2,808 2,060\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $0.1 million, which was primarily due to the net loss of $3.5 million,\nadjusted for net non-cash charges of $6.5 million, which included $3.7 million of stock-based compensation, $2.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, and\n$0.2 million in ROU asset amortization expenses. Cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately $3.1 million and was primarily due to\ndecreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenues, partially offset by a decrease in contract assets and accounts receivable.\nFor the nine months ended October 1, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $0.2 million, which was primarily due to the net loss of $2.3 million,\nadjusted for net non-cash charges of $4.0 million, which included $1.9 million of stock-based compensation, $1.2 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $0.6\nmillion in write-downs of inventories, and $0.3 million in ROU asset amortization expenses. Cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was\napproximately $1.9 million and was primarily due to increases in contract assets and other assets and decreases in accounts payable and lease liabilities, partially offset by\ndecreases in accounts receivable and increases in accrued liabilities.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 cash used in investing activities was $5.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which\nwere primarily attributable to the capital expenditures relating to licensed software, capitalized internal-use software, and purchase of specialized semiconductor tooling,\nwhich was capitalized.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nCash flows from financing activities include the draw-downs and repayments of our line of credit. For the quarters ended September 29, 2024 and October 1,\n2023, these draw-downs and repayments netted to zero.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $2.8 million, which was primarily derived from the net proceeds of\n$3.7 million from the common stock issuance, partially offset by $0.9 million in payments related to financing arrangements.\nFor the nine months ended October 1, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $2.1 million and was primarily derived from the net proceeds of $2.4\nmillion from the common stock issuances and borrowings of notes payable of $0.1 million, partially offset by $0.5 million in payments related to financing arrangements.\nPart I. Financial Information (continued)\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet partnerships, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others, often referred to as\nstructured finance or special purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited\npurposes.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot Applicable.\n23\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on management's evaluation as of September 29, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance\nlevel to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\ninternal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the\nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.

The risks, uncertainties, and assumptions referred to above that could cause our results to differ materially from the results\nexpressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A hereto and the\nrisks, uncertainties, and assumptions discussed from time to time in our other public filings and public announcements. All forward-looking statements included in this\ndocument are based on information available to us as of the date hereof. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the\ninclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements, or our objectives\nand plans will be achieved. Furthermore, past performance in operations and share price is not necessarily indicative of future performance. We disclaim any intention or\nobligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAs used herein, \"QuickLogic,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" and similar terms include QuickLogic Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates\notherwise.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRisk Factor Summary\nSome of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• We have incurred losses in the past years. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to fund future losses, and we may not be\nable to sustain sufficient liquidity, and as a result, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n• Our future operating results are likely to fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n• Cyberattacks, like our 2023 cybersecurity incident can lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation\nor competitive position.\n• We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face significant expenses as a result of future litigation.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\n• We may be unable to accurately estimate quarterly revenue, which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock.\n• If we do not maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted, which could, among other\nthings, reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Global and Economic Conditions\n• The semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and has experienced significant consolidation, and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive\nopportunities for consolidation, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n• The semiconductor business is subject to downward price pressure.\nRisks Related to Our Products\n• If we fail to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products and other new solutions or if our design opportunities do not generate the revenue we expect,\nwe may be unable to compete effectively in the future and our future gross margins and operating results will be lower.\n• If markets for our new products do not develop, or if our products do not meet customer needs, the loss of or reduction in orders could adversely affect our\nrevenue and harm our business financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n• If our AI products are not low touch, the cost of addressing the fragmented AI market will be high, which will delay market penetration, result in reduced revenues\nor require increased expenses, any of which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our business financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n• Our products are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and\nresources in the design of their products\n• If we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products, we may incur product shortages or excess product inventories.\nRisk Related to Our Customers and Partners\n• We currently depend on a limited number of significant customers, for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or reduction in orders from, such\nsignificant customers could adversely affect our revenue and harm our business financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n• We depend on our relationships with third parties to manufacture our new products.\n• We depend upon third parties for silicon IP, detailed registered-transfer level, (\"RTL\"), design, physical design, verification and assembly of our silicon platforms\nand any failure to meet our requirements in a timely fashion may adversely affect our time to market and revenue.\n• We depend upon partnering with other companies to develop IP, reference platforms, algorithm and system software.\n• We depend upon third parties to fabricate, assemble, test and program our products, and to provide logistics services. Any problems at these third parties could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nQuickLogic Corporation was founded in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We provide innovative, programmable silicon and software platforms to\nenable our customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, we are a fabless semiconductor company with a variety\nof products: embedded FPGA (\"eFPGA\") intellectual property (\"IP\"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips (\"SoCs\"), discrete FPGAs, and AI software. Our\ncustomers can use our eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products, our SoCs to run our customers'\nsoftware and build their hardware around, and our discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML Corporation (\"SensiML\"), our\nwholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of\nplatforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor processing across Aerospace, and Defense, Consumer/Industrial\nIoT, and Consumer Electronics markets.\nOur new products include the following: eFPGA IP Licensing business, associated professional services, consisting of development and integration of eFPGA\ntechnology into custom semiconductor solutions, our silicon products consisting of EOS™, QuickAI™, ArcticLink® III, PolarPro®3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II\nproducts. In addition to delivering our own semiconductor solutions, our new products category includes our AI/ML Software Platform from our wholly-owned subsidiary\ncompany, SensiML, which includes Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions for development, per unit license fees when deployed in production, and proof-of-concept\nservices, all of which are also included in the new products revenue category. Our mature products include primarily FPGA families named PASIC®3 and QuickRAM®, as\nwell as programming hardware and design software.\nFor our IP and silicon platforms, we collaborate with multiple partners on co-marketing and/or co-selling initiatives. These partners could have primary business\nlines in semiconductor IP, Design Services, semiconductor foundry, semiconductor assembly and test, and others.\nFor our AI/ML Software, SensiML collaborates with several microcontroller and sensor manufacturers to integrate the microcontroller and/or sensor manufacturers’\ndevelopment kits with SensiML’s Analytics Toolkit in order to showcase combined solutions for AI/ML applications. Currently, these collaborations include Infineon\nTechnologies, On Semiconductor Corp., Microchip Technology Inc., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Arduino, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Raspberry Pi,\nand Nordic Semiconductor.\nOur eFPGA IP is currently developed on 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, 28nm, 40nm, 65nm, 90nm, 130nm, and 250nm process nodes with a roadmap to more advanced\nnodes. The licensable IP is generated by our automated compiler tool called Australis™, which enables our engineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can then\nintegrate into their SoC without significant involvement by QuickLogic. We believe this flow enables a scalable development and support model for QuickLogic. For our\neFPGA strategy, we typically work with semiconductor manufacturing partners prior to this IP being licensed to a SoC company.\nWe have changed our manufacturing strategies to reduce the cost of our silicon solution platforms to enable their use in a range of unique products ranging from low\nto high volume. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, QuickAI and ArcticLink III silicon platforms combine mixed signal physical functions and hard-wired logic alongside our field\nprogrammable logic. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, and ArcticLink III solution platforms are manufactured on process nodes where we can benefit from smaller die sizes and lower\npower consumption. We typically implement sophisticated logic blocks and mixed signal functions in hard-wired logic because it is very cost-effective and energy efficient. We\nuse small form factor packages, which are less expensive to manufacture and include smaller pin counts. Reduced pin counts result in lower costs for our customers' printed\ncircuit board space and routing. Furthermore, our SRAM reprogrammable silicon platforms can be programmed in-system by our customers, and therefore, we do not incur\nprogramming costs, lowering the overall cost of ownership to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in silicon solution platforms and manufacturing technologies that\nmake us competitive for the variety of markets and applications that programmable logic serves.\nIn order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, including existing new product platforms and\nplatforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven mainly by eFPGA IP and our silicon solutions, with additional contributions from SensiML AI\nSoftware. Therefore, our revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sale, and marketing of\nour new solution platforms, IP, and software.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Information\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 2220 Lundy Avenue, San Jose, California 95131.

References to Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021 refer to the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023,\nJanuary 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nIndustry Background\nHistorically, system processing capability was built using a homogenous architecture, meaning one that consisted of the use of only one type of technology. This\ncould be one or more instances of a single processor type, or only programmable logic. More recently, there is a general trend in the semiconductor market that enhanced\nprocessing capability can come from the adoption of more heterogeneous architectures. Examples of this trend are the inclusion of one or more general purpose processor cores\n(e.g., Arm or RISC-V) in conjunction with programmable logic. This type of architecture enables the end user to partition their application workloads across the\nheterogeneous cores so that the most appropriate core is used for a given workload, often concurrently. Generally, this is viewed as the most optimal way to design systems that\nneed to optimize for performance or battery life. The heterogeneity can be implemented as multiple discrete devices on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), multiple IP cores in a\nmonolithic device, or as multiple devices (e.g., chiplets) integrated into an advanced package.\nAn important underlying trend for the Aerospace and Defense, and Industrial markets is that there is a need for a high degree of fragmentation of system\nfunctionality. This drives a need for a time and cost-efficient product development flow while maintaining the ability to extend the life cycle of a given design through design\nchanges and uniquely optimize designs for new workloads and/or algorithms that need to be deployed (e.g., deploying more advanced AI algorithms in the future).\nDevelopment time and non-recurring engineering (\"NRE\") costs tend to be more of the focus for hardware products in these markets rather than the bill of materials cost.\nWe believe these industry trends are shifting the demand among different classes of core silicon. The following are the four main classes of non-memory core\nsilicon:\n• Microcontrollers (\"MCUs\") are typically small, low-power hardware products on a single integrated circuit that contain a processor core, memory, and a number\nof peripherals. They are designed to be programmed with software for embedded applications;\n• Application Specific Standard Products (\"ASSPs\") other than processors, are fixed-function hardware products designed to address a relatively narrow set of\napplications. These hardware products typically integrate a number of common peripherals or functions, and the functionality of these hardware products is fixed\nprior to wafer fabrication;\n• Programmable Logic Devices (\"PLDs\") are general-purpose hardware products, which can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers and are\ncustomized after purchase for a specific application. FPGAs are a subset of PLDs and are typically used to implement complex system functions; and\n• Application Specific Integrated Circuits (\"ASICs\") are custom hardware products designed and fabricated to meet the needs of one specific application for one\nend-customer. Structured ASICs, a sub-category of ASICs, provide a limited amount of custom content to broaden the applicability of a device for additional\napplications.\nASSPs are offered broadly to the market, making it challenging for a system designer to create differentiated products from these hardware products alone. In many\nsituations, the available ASSPs may not directly implement the desired function and the system designer is required to use a combination of ASSPs to achieve the desired result\nat the expense of increased cost, product size, and power consumption. As standards evolve or new standards are developed, ASSPs may not be available to implement desired\nfunctions.\nSystem designers can customize their products using programmable logic, ASICs or MCUs. The competitive dynamic between these classes of core silicon is well\nunderstood. High development risks, development costs, and opportunity costs are incurred when using ASICs to produce custom hardware products with either very low unit\nproduction cost or unique functionality that is only achievable with a customer ASIC solution. Suppliers of programmable logic hardware products, which have lower\ndevelopment and market risks and development costs relative to ASICs, have aggressively reduced the unit cost of their products over time, making programmable logic\nhardware products the solution of choice for custom products unless the volume is very high or the functionality and/or operating environment is unique. These cost reduction\nefforts have significantly increased the volume required to justify the total cost of an ASIC.\nField Programmable Gate Array (\"FPGA\") technology has been used historically by system companies and OEMs to develop and deploy customer-specific\nfunctionality with fast time-to-market and low development costs. End market use includes Aerospace and Defense, Industrial, Computing, Communications, IoT, and\nConsumer. According to a recent research report published by Grand View Research, the FPGA market is expected to grow at >10% Compound Annual Growth Rate\n(\"CAGR\") from 2023 to 2030. Of that, the Aerospace and Defense segment is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR of 12.7% over the same forecast period. The emergence\nof embedded field programmable gate array IP technology (\"eFPGA IP\") has particularly favored the aerospace and defense industry by offering even better integration,\nreliability, and low power options over the use of traditional discrete FPGAs.\nThe Aerospace and Defense, and Industrial markets are well served by existing core silicon or custom ASIC development. Although much of these market's uses are\ngenerally not as price, power, and size sensitive, there are use cases for reducing size, weight and power. When there is a strong need for a custom solution to address specific\nfunctionality or operating environment (e.g., high radiation, extended temperature ranges, etc.), designers often turn to discrete FPGAs, or in some cases when standard FPGAs\ndo not exist, an ASIC. QuickLogic FPGAs have a loyal following in certain segments of these markets, particularly when instant-on, energy efficiency, high reliability, or\nintellectual property security is important.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIn the past two years, QuickLogic has also entered into multiple, large eFPGA-related contracts with customers in the Aerospace and Defense market and expects to\ncontinue to do so in the future. Historically, the Defense market has followed QuickLogic’s mature products revenue trend, but recent advancements in QuickLogic’s Australis\nIP generator tool, the recent Strategic Radiation Hardened FPGA contract for the U.S. Department of Defense, participation in the DARPA Toolbox, and other eFPGA-related\ncontracts with the Defense Industrial Base have enabled renewed interest from customers in this area. Consequently, QuickLogic expects these trends to be a primary growth\ndriver.\nMarkets and Product Technology\nWe market our programmable logic (FPGAs and eFPGA IP) solutions primarily to Defense Industrial Base contractors, U.S. Government entities, and System\nOEMs, and fabless semiconductor companies. These customers may value one or more of our product categories. A solution can be based on our programmable technology,\nwhich enables customized designs, low power, flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market, and lower total cost of ownership. We are capable of providing complete\nsolutions because of our investment in developing the low power IP and software required to implement specific functions, along with sensor software algorithms optimized for\nour architecture. In some cases, we develop the IPs and either software or firmware ourselves and, in other cases, we utilize third parties to develop the mixed signal physical\nlayers, logic, and/or software.\nWe market our SoC and SensiML solutions to OEMs and ODMs offering differentiated Consumer/IoT products, to processor vendors wishing to expand their served\navailable market, and to sensor manufacturers and sensor processing software companies wishing to expand their ecosystems. Our target markets for our SoC and SensiML\nproducts include Consumer/Industrial IoT and Consumer Electronics.\nBy using our silicon platforms, our IPs, our software, and our in-depth architecture knowledge, we can deliver energy efficient custom solutions that blend the\nbenefits of traditional ASSPs with the flexibility, product proliferation, differentiation, and low total cost of ownership advantages of programmable logic.\nOur product technology consists of five major elements:\n1. Programmable Logic Technology\nOur programmable logic enables our customers to customize their hardware platforms. We have two distinct types of programmable logic – Reprogrammable and\nOne-Time Programmable (\"OTP\"). Within our Reprogrammable logic architecture, we can utilize standard foundry processes (e.g., CMOS-logic process with foundry-provided\nSRAM memory elements) or more unique processes (e.g., foundry-provided CMOS logic processes and third-party-provided memory elements (e.g., MRAM)). We can choose\nthe appropriate process technology based on our customers’ requirements. Our SRAM-reprogrammable logic is the basis of our eFPGA IP License initiative and is the logic\nused in our EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI products. An example of the unique process combination is when we use foundry-provided CMOS with MRAM in the\nStrategic Radiation Hardened FPGA program for which we are the prime contractor.\nThe second type of is our programmable logic is our ViaLink® OTP technology. ViaLink is our proprietary and patented technology and possesses the\ncharacteristics of non-volatility and instant-on, very low standby power, low dynamic power, small form factor, power cycles easily and quickly are required.\n2. Semiconductor Intellectual Property\nWe develop semiconductor intellectual property (IP) cores for licensing to our customers or for use within our own devices. Licensable eFPGA IP based on our Field\nProgrammable Gate Array technology is called “embedded FPGA IP”. The eFPGA IP is generated by our automated IP compiler tool called Australis™, which enables our\nengineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can then integrate into their SoC without significant involvement by us. We believe this flow enables a scalable\ndevelopment and support model for our company. Additionally, we may develop and provide other IP blocks that our customers can use in conjunction with our eFPGA IP, such\nas signal processing / digital filter functions, hardware acceleration, processor offloading, and various bus interface functions.\n3. FPGA User Tools\nWe develop, maintain and support software tools that our customers use to program their designs into our FPGA, eFPGA IP and SoC products. By design, all\nprogrammable logic technology is unconfigured in its default state after manufacturing. Designers using programmable logic must configure the state of the programmable\nlogic to match their requirements; this is accomplished by a suite of tools commonly referred to as FPGA User Tools. There are two such categories of FPGA User Tools –\nproprietary and open-source. Historically, FPGA/eFPGA vendors have provided only proprietary versions of these tools to their customers. For our Mature products, we\ncontinue to support a 100% proprietary FPGA User Tool. For our new products and eFPGA IP, we support a 100% open-source version, as well as a hybrid FPGA User Tool\ncalled Aurora that combines open-source and proprietary technology.\n4. Silicon Platforms\nWe have two types of silicon platforms, discrete FPGAs and SoCs that embed FPGA technology. We have a variety of discrete FPGAs – historically based on our\nViaLink technology, more recently based on our Reprogrammable technology (either SRAM- or MRAM-based configuration). We also have multiple silicon platforms that fall\nunder the SoC category - ArcticLink and EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI. Our SoC platforms combine mixed signal physical functions, hard-wired logic, and\nprogrammable logic on one device. Adding hard-wired IP enables us to deliver more logic at lower cost and lower power while the programmable logic allows us to provide\nsolutions that can be rapidly customized to differentiate products, add features, and reduce system development costs. This combination of mixed signal, hard-wired logic, and\nprogrammable logic enables us to deliver low cost, small form factor solutions that can be customized for a particular customer or market requirements while lowering the total\ncost of ownership.\n7\n5. Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) Software\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary company, SensiML, we develop and optimize an end-to-end software suite that provides developers with a practical means\nfor developing IoT sensor algorithms using AI. Each component of the software suite handles specific steps to progress from initial raw sensor data collection using prototype\nhardware to optimized firmware code generation, validation and testing, and post-ship algorithm updates and continuous learning enhancements. SensiML Data Studio\n(formerly the Data Capture Lab) is a full-featured client tool that enables rapid, efficient, and collaborative multi-user data collection, cleansing, labeling, and metadata\nannotation of custom application datasets. SensiML Analytics Studio is a cloud service component that uses labeled datasets to deliver device-optimized firmware for a chosen\nendpoint product. SensiML Test App is used to quickly and efficiently validate final device firmware and test for the proper behavior, accuracy, and performance of the\nalgorithm empirically on actual endpoint hardware. Lastly, the SensiML Application Programmer’s Interface (\"API\") is a simplified interface to extend the SensiML algorithms\nand manage advanced features like edge model tuning and continuous learning updates to the cloud.\nMarketing, Sales and Customers\nWe monetize our technology through hardware product sales and eFPGA IP licenses, with any necessary corresponding work delivered via professional engineering\nservices, SensiML Analytics Toolkit subscriptions, and per unit royalties. We specialize in enhancing the user experience in leading edge IoT hardware products. For our\ncustomers, we enable hardware and sensor algorithmic differentiation quickly, cost-effectively, and at low power. For our partners, we expand their reach into new segments\nand new use cases, thereby expanding the served available market for their existing hardware products.\nOur embedded FPGA technology gives ASIC and SoC developers the benefit of flexibility to make design changes post-manufacturing changes at very fast time-to-\nand time-in-market, while keeping power consumption low. Our multi-core sensor processing products such as ArcticLink 3 S1, ArcticLink 3 S2, EOS 3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS\nS3AI provide an extremely power-efficient approach for real-time multi-modal (vision, motion, voice, location, biometric, and environmental) sensor processing independently\nof the cloud. Our SensiML Analytics Toolkit is cutting-edge software that enables ultra-low power IoT endpoints that implement AI to transform raw sensor data into\nmeaningful insight at the device itself. The toolkit also provides an end-to-end development platform spanning data collection, labeling, algorithm and firmware auto\ngeneration, and testing.\nWe recognize that our markets require a range of solutions, and we intend to work with market-leading companies to combine silicon solution platforms, packaging\ntechnology, FPGA User Tools, sensor software algorithms, software drivers and firmware, to meet the product proliferation, high bandwidth, time-to-market, time-in-market,\nand form factor requirements of our customers. We intend to continue to define and implement compelling solutions for our target customers and partners.\nWe believe our solutions are resonating with our target customers who value lower power consumption, platform design flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer\ntime-in-market, and low total cost of ownership available through the use of our solutions.\nWe sell our products through a network of sales managers in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, we\nhave international sales operations in Japan and the United Kingdom. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and application\nsupport for a given region, focusing on major strategic accounts, and managing our channel sales partners such as distributors.\nCustomers typically order our products through our distributors. Currently, we have eight active distributors in North America and a network of seventeen active\ndistributors and sales representatives throughout Europe and Asia to support our international business. eFPGA IP customers and SensiML SaaS subscribers typically enter into\nlicensing agreements directly with QuickLogic and SensiML, respectively.\nWe also have an Aerospace and Defense, industrial, and IoT product customer base that purchases our mature silicon products. We expect to continue to offer silicon\nhardware products to these customers, as well as new eFPGA IP for when these customers choose to implement their own silicon platform solution.\nOne customer represented approximately 70% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Three customers represented 20%, 16%, and 12% of our\ntotal revenue for the year ended January 1, 2023. In addition, a noteworthy portion of our revenue comes from sales to customers located outside of the United States. See Note\n14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBacklog\nWe do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. The majority of our quarterly silicon shipments are typically booked during\nthe quarter. Our silicon sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders issued by OEM customers and distributors. Our eFPGA IP and design service contracts\nare typically made pursuant to license agreements and development contracts. Development contracts can span several months to several quarters in duration.\nCompetition\nA number of companies offer products that compete with one or more of our semiconductor products and solutions. Competitors of our eFPGA semiconductor IP\ninclude small, venture-backed startup companies. Competitors of our low power discrete FPGA devices include suppliers of low-density FPGAs such as Lattice Semiconductor\nCorp. and Microsemi Corp. (a subsidiary of Microchip Technology Inc.). Competitors for our Aerospace and Defense discrete FPGAs include conventional FPGAs suppliers\nsuch as Xilinx Inc. (a subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.), Altera (a subsidiary of Intel Corp.), and Microsemi Corp. Competitors of our SensiML AI/ML Software\nbusiness include several small, venture-backed startup companies.\n8\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nWe are focused on developing our core programmable logic technology and software tools. Our products combine our silicon platforms with our eFPGA IP, FPGA\nUser Tools, software drivers, and other system software, and may include SensiML software for AI applications.\nOur future success will depend largely on our ability to rapidly develop, enhance, and port to new foundry and process technology our eFPGA IP solutions, as well\nas continue to enhance and support our FPGA User Tools to meet emerging industry standards and satisfy changing customer requirements. Further, our future success will\ndepend on our ability to execute on current, large eFPGA IP and discrete FPGA development contracts, as well as win new ones. We have made and expect to continue to make\nsubstantial investments in R&D. Our R&D expenses were $6.4 million, or 30% of revenue, $5.0 million, or 31% of revenue, and $6.9 million, or 55% of revenue for the years\nended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect increases in\nemployee salary, software maintenance, and financing arrangement expenses and reductions in the allocation of R&D expenses to cost of revenues.\nManufacturing\nWe have close relationships with third-party manufacturers for our customer commercial products for wafer fabrication, package assembly, and testing requirements\nto help us ensure stability in the supply of our products and to allow us to focus our internal efforts on product and solution design and sales.\nIn connection with commercial customers, we outsource commercial products wafer manufacturing, primarily to GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company Limited (\"TSMC\"). We outsource our commercial product packaging primarily to Amkor Technology, Inc. Integra Specialty Products, JCET Group\nCo. Ltd., and Golden Altos Corp. GlobalFoundries manufactures our EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI Sensor Platform in a 40 nm complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (\"CMOS\") process, and PolarPro 3E, ArcticLink III VX and BX, and ArcticLink 3 S2 Sensor Hub, in a 65 nm CMOS process. TSMC manufactures our PASIC\n3, QuickRAM and certain QuickPCI products, using a 0.35 nm CMOS process. TSMC also manufactures our Eclipse products on 0.25 micron CMOS process, and other\nproducts using a 65nm CMOS process on twelve-inch wafers. We purchase products from GlobalFoundries and TSMC on a purchase order basis.\nOutsourcing of commercial wafer manufacturing enables us to take advantage of the high-volume economies of scale offered by these suppliers. We may establish\nadditional commercial foundry relationships as such arrangements become economically useful or technically necessary.\nIn connection with U.S. Government end-user customers, we are required to procure wafer fabrication, package assembly, and testing from sources that maintain\nDefense Microelectronics Activity accreditation from the U.S. Department of Defense and maintain certain intellectual property security standards. We outsource wafer\nmanufacturing, packaging, and testing services to certified U.S.-owned and continental U.S.-based suppliers.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 49 employees worldwide, of which 45 employees were located in the United States. We believe our future success depends in part\non our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our employee relations are\nfavorable. We recognize that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified talent. The well-being of\nemployees is a key priority and includes a dynamic and welcoming workplace that promotes inclusive diversity, fosters collaboration, encourages employees to bring their best\nideas to work every day, and promotes work-life balance. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the\ngranting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform\nto the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our research and development staff consisted of 20 employees located in California, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Taiwan. These employees\nconstitute the following groups:\n• Our silicon engineering group develops our eFPGA IP and FPGA products.\n• Our electronic design and automation software group collaborates with the open-source software community to ensure the design libraries, interface routines, and\nplace and route software that allow our customer to take their own designs and target them to programmable hardware products are optimized. Our system\nsoftware group creates the drivers and other system code required to connect our silicon hardware products to Application Processors, drivers, and microcode to\nsupport our sensor hubs.\n• Our hardware group develops and verifies IP Blocks that can be programmed into our programmable logic and develops primarily open-source hardware reference\ndesigns to showcase and verify our solutions.\n• Our product engineering group oversees product manufacturing and process development with our third-party foundries and is involved in ongoing process\nimprovements to increase yields and optimize device characteristics.\n• The office of the CTO investigates future trends and requirements in order to define the next generation of solutions and platforms.\n• Our SensiML group develops and maintains all software with respect to the SensiML Analytics Software Suite.\nWe monitor employee turnover rates by region and globally. Approximately 34% of our employees have been employed by us for more than 10 years and\napproximately 20% have been employed by us for more than 20 years. The average tenure is 9.65 years. Our turnover rate was 14% for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023. We believe our compensation philosophy, along with the career growth and development opportunities promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that it is important to maintain a large patent portfolio to protect our innovations. We currently hold 21 active U.S. patents and have five pending\napplications for additional U.S. patents. Our patents contain claims covering various aspects of programmable integrated circuits, programmable interconnect structures, and\nprogrammable metal hardware products. In Europe and Asia, we hold five patents and have zero pending applications. Our issued patents expire between 2026-2042.\nIn most cases, revenue will decline from a decrease in demand for our mature products long before the expiration of pending or issued patents relating to the\nunderlying technology in such products. The decision to cease maintaining a patent is made based on the importance of the patent in our current or future product offerings.\nWe have five registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nWith regard to certain patents, the U.S. Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or\nauthorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers and Directors\nOur executive officers are appointed by, and serve at the discretion of, our Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the SEC, the following risk factors should be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually\noccurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other\nvariables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use\nhistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred losses in the past years. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to fund future losses, and we may not be able to\nsustain sufficient liquidity, and as a result, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have experienced net losses in the past years as we continue to develop new products, applications and technologies. Some of our new products and products\ncurrently under development have generated lower gross margin as a percentage of revenue than our mature products due to the markets that we have targeted, and the larger\norder quantities associated with these new products. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted, and our\ninvestment portfolio is subject to a degree of interest rate and liquidity risk. Unless such cash flow levels are achieved, in addition to the proceeds that we received during\nFiscal 2023 from the sale of our equity securities, and the credit line we may be able to draw down from Heritage Bank of Commerce, we may need to obtain additional funds\nthrough strategic divestiture, or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient sales from our new products or adequate funds are not available when needed, our liquidity, financial condition and operating\nresults would be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations or at all.\nOur future operating results are likely to fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nOur operating results have varied widely in the past and are likely to do so in the future. In addition, our past operating results may not be an indicator of future\noperating results.\nFactors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include, without limitation: (i) successful development and market acceptance of our products and\nsolutions; (ii) our ability to accurately forecast product volumes and mix, and to respond to rapid changes in customer demand; (iii) changes in sales volume or expected sales\nvolume, product mix, average selling prices or production variances that affect gross profit; (iv) the effect of end-of-life programs; (v) a significant change in sales to, or the\ncollectability of accounts receivable from, our largest customers; (vi) our ability to adjust our product features, manufacturing capacity and costs in response to economic and\ncompetitive pressures; (vii) our reliance on subcontract manufacturers for product capacity, yield and quality; (viii) our competitors’ product portfolio and product pricing\npolicies; (ix) timely implementation of efficient manufacturing technologies; (x) errors in applying or changes in accounting and corporate governance rules; (xi) the issuance\nof equity compensation awards or changes in the terms of our stock plan or employee stock purchase plan; (xii) mergers or acquisitions; (xiii) the impact of import and export\nlaws and regulations; (xiv) the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and general economic, market, political and social conditions in the countries where we sell our\nproducts and the related effect on our customers, distributors and suppliers; and (xv) our ability to obtain capital, debt financing and insurance on commercially reasonable\nterms, and allocations between our operating expenses and cost of sales. Although certain of these factors are out of our immediate control, unless we can anticipate and be\nprepared with contingency plans that respond to these factors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, which could\ncause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or decline.\nWe may also encounter periods of industry-wide semiconductor oversupply, resulting in pricing pressure, as well as undersupply, resulting in a risk that we could be\nunable to fulfill our customers' requirements. The semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for, and supply of, its products.\nThese fluctuations have resulted in circumstances when supply of and demand for semiconductors has been widely out of balance. An industry-wide semiconductor oversupply\ncould result in severe downward pricing pressure from customers. In a market with an undersupply of manufacturing capacity, we would have to compete with larger foundry\nand assembly customers for limited manufacturing resources. In such an environment, we may be unable to have our products manufactured in a timely manner, at a cost that\ngenerates adequate gross profit or in sufficient quantities. Since we outsource all of our manufacturing and generally have a single source of wafer supply, test, assembly and\nprogramming for our products, we are particularly vulnerable to such supply shortages and capacity limitations. As a result, we may be unable to fulfill orders and may lose\ncustomers. Any future industry-wide oversupply or undersupply of semiconductors could therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nCyberattacks, like our January 2023 cybersecurity incident that was previously disclosed, can lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims,\nor harm to our reputation or competitive position.\nAs demonstrated by our January 2023 cybersecurity incident that was previously disclosed, security vulnerabilities may arise from our hardware, software,\nemployees, contractors or policies we have deployed, which may result in external parties gaining access to our networks, data centers, cloud data centers, corporate computers,\nmanufacturing systems, and/or access to accounts we have at our suppliers, vendors, and customers. Due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or\notherwise, an unauthorized party may gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or attack the networks causing denial of service or attempt to hold our data or\nsystems in ransom. The vulnerability could be caused by inadequate account security practices such as failure to timely remove employee access when terminated. To mitigate\nthese security issues, we have implemented measures throughout our organization, including firewalls, backups, encryption, employee information technology policies and user\naccount policies. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be sufficient to avoid cyberattacks. If any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we\nwere unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation could be materially harmed, and\nwe could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability.\nAs previously disclosed, we detected a ransomware infection on January 20, 2023 affecting a limited number of IT systems, including systems that contained\npersonal information of our employees. While we took steps to resolve this issue and believe the incident has not had nor will have a material impact on our business,\noperations, ability to serve our customers, or financial results, similar cybersecurity incidents could occur in the future.\nFurther, if we fail to adequately maintain our infrastructure, we may have outages and data loss. Excessive outages may affect our ability to timely and efficiently\ndeliver products to customers or develop new products and solutions. Such disruptions and data loss may adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders, patent our intellectual\nproperty or protect our source code, and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results,\nstock price, and reputation.\n11\nTable of Contents\nEffective May 25, 2018, the European Union (\"EU\") implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) a broad data protection framework that\nexpands the scope of current EU data protection law to non-European Union entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of EU subjects. The\nGDPR allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of EU subjects, including through a data\nsecurity breach. The State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) effective on January 1, 2020, which contains requirements similar to\nGDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents, commencing on January 1, 2020. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which was voted\ninto law by California residents in 2020 and amends the CCPA, imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California and creates a\nnew California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which will likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of\ndata protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023 and became enforceable on July 1, 2023.\nPrivacy and security laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, standards, and other obligations are constantly evolving, and may conflict with each other, and any such laws,\nschemes, regulations and standards may have an adverse impact on our business if we are not able to comply or if compliance requires time and resources for implementation.\nOur company's, collaborators’, and contractors’ failure to fully comply with GDPR, CCPA and other laws could lead to significant fines and require\nonerous corrective action. In addition, data security breaches experienced by us, our collaborators or contractors could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty, public disclosure of sensitive commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees,\ncustomers, collaborators, and others.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems, breach of the\nsystems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through employee or contractor error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such\nunauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands,\nclaims, and litigation by private parties, and investigations, related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying\naffected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, or use or\ndisclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially\nimpair our ability to attract and retain customers, and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face significant expenses as a result of future litigation.\nProtection of intellectual property rights is crucial to our business, since that is how we keep others from copying our innovations and those of third parties that are\ncentral to our existing and future products. From time to time, we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to license other parties’ patents. We evaluate these\nrequests on a case-by-case basis. These situations may lead to litigation if we reject the offer to obtain the license.\nIn the past, we have been involved in litigation relating to our alleged infringement of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. This type of litigation\nis expensive and consumes large amounts of management time and attention.\nBecause it is critical to our success that we continue to prevent competitors from copying our innovations, we intend to continue to seek patent and trade secret\nprotection for our products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will\nactually result in issued patents or that, even if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to\nus. Furthermore, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own. We also rely on trade secret protection for\nour technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties. However, these parties may breach these agreements and we\nmay not have adequate remedies for any breach. In any case, others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods. In addition, the laws\nof certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe may be unable to successfully grow our business if we fail to compete effectively with others to attract and retain our executive officers, and other key management or\ntechnical personnel.\nWe believe our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly competent personnel. Our employees are at-will and not subject to employment\ncontracts. We could potentially lose the services of any of our senior management personnel at any time due to a variety of factors that could include, without limitation, death,\nincapacity, military service, personal issues, retirement, resignation or competing employers. Our ability to execute current plans could be adversely affected by such a loss. We\nmay fail to attract and retain qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel required to continue to operate our business successfully. Personnel with the\nexpertise necessary for our business are scarce and competition for personnel with proper skills is intense.\nIn addition, new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity. Additionally, attrition in personnel can result from,\namong other things, changes related to acquisitions, retirement, and disability. We may not be able to retain existing key technical, sales, marketing, and managerial employees\nor be successful in attracting, developing, or retaining other highly qualified technical, sales, marketing, and managerial personnel, particularly at such times in the future as we\nmay need to fill a key position. If we are unable to continue to develop and retain existing executive officers or other key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly\nqualified employees, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere may be some effects of system outages or data security breaches, which could adversely affect our operations, financial results or reputation.\nWe face risks from electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failures. We rely heavily on our internal information and\ncommunications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively. Any of these are subject to failure. System-\nwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows. Further, insurance coverage does not generally protect from normal wear and tear, which can affect system performance. Any applicable insurance coverage for an\noccurrence could prove to be inadequate. Coverage may be or become unavailable or inapplicable to any risks then prevalent.\nOur company’s global operations are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nMany of our products are manufactured outside of the United States at manufacturing facilities operated by our suppliers in Asia and South Asia. In addition, most of\nour domestic customers sell their products outside of North America, thereby indirectly exposing us to risks associated with foreign commerce and economic instability. We\ncontinue to maintain overseas sales offices.\n12\nTable of Contents\nInternational operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the U.S., such as changes in currency exchange rates, tax laws, price and\ncurrency exchange controls, export and import restrictions, environmental regulations, protection of intellectual property rights, nationalization, expropriation and other\ngovernmental action. Accordingly, our operations and revenue are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce, including the following: (i) staffing and\nmanaging foreign offices; (ii) managing foreign distributors; (iii) collecting amounts due; (iv) political and economic instability; (v) foreign currency exchange fluctuations;\n(vi) changes in tax laws, import and export regulations, tariffs and freight rates; (vii) timing and availability of export licenses; (viii) supplying products that meet local\nenvironmental regulations; and (ix) inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. In addition, we incur costs in foreign countries that may be difficult to reduce quickly\nbecause of employee-related laws and practices in those foreign countries. Our global operations also may be adversely affected by political events and domestic or\ninternational terrorist events and hostilities. Current events, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, rising tensions with Taiwan,\npotential disruption caused by pandemics, the United Kingdom’s recent exit from the European Union, and potential changes in immigration policies and tax reform proposals,\ncreate a level of uncertainty for multi-national companies. As U.S. companies continue to expand globally, increased complexity exists due to the possibility of renegotiated\ntrade deals, revised international tax law treaties, and changes to the U.S. corporate tax code. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our\nresults of operations and financial condition. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively\nmanage these and other risks.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions.\nWe continue to seek acquisitions of businesses that we believe can complement our current business activities, both financially and strategically. Acquisitions,\ninvolve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business’ past activities, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource\nprograms, integrating technology systems and other infrastructures under our control, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on our internal controls and\ncompliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of\nthe company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. As a result, the realization of anticipated synergies or\nbenefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced.\nLitigation could adversely impact our consolidated financial position.\nWe have been and may be in the future involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation\nrelating to employment matters, commercial transactions, intellectual property matters, contracts, environmental matters and matters related to compliance with governmental\nregulations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and unpredictable. The potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, such factors as the costs and expenses of\nlitigation and the time and attention required of management to attend to litigation. An unfavorable resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding, and/or the costs and\nexpenses incurred in connection with a legal claim or proceeding, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, such as actual events or concerns\ninvolving liquidity, defaults or non-performance, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or other companies in the\nfinancial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds, have in the past and may in the future lead to\nmarket-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and\nInnovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") as receiver. On March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were closed\nand placed under receivership. We did not have any direct depository or other financial relationships with the aforementioned closed banks. Although a statement by the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC stated that all depositors of these financial institutions would have access to all of their money after only one\nbusiness day following the date of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial\ninstruments with financial institutions placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. If any of our counterparties to any such\ninstruments that we may enter into in the future were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In addition, if any parties with whom we conduct\nbusiness are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to us or\nto enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to these financial institutions' credit\nagreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit, among other, may experience direct impacts from the closure of these financial\ninstitutions and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry.\nOur access to our cash and cash equivalents in amounts adequate to finance our operations could be significantly impaired by the financial institutions with which\nwe have arrangements directly facing liquidity constraints or failures. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less\nfavorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and\nliquidity sources, thereby, making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any material declines in available funding or our ability to access\nour cash, cash equivalents, and liquidity resources could adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial and contractual obligations, or result in breaches\nof our contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts could have material adverse impacts on our operations and\nliquidity.\nOur business is subject to political, economic and health risks, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\noperations.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, flood, terrorist acts, and other catastrophic events\nbeyond our control. In particular, our headquarters are located near earthquake fault lines in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, we rely on certain suppliers to\nmanufacture our products and would not be able to qualify an alternate supplier of our products for several quarters. Our suppliers often hold significant quantities of our\ninventories, which, in the event of a disaster, could be destroyed. If there is an earthquake or other catastrophic event near our headquarters, our customers’ facilities, our\ndistributors' facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, our business could be seriously harmed.\nIn addition, any catastrophic event, the failure of our computer systems or networks, including due to computer viruses, security breaches, war or acts of terrorism,\ncould significantly disrupt our operations. Specifically, any prolonged health threat globally could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries,\nresulting in an economic downturn that could impact our operating results. The occurrence of any of these events could also affect our customers, distributors and suppliers and\nproduce similar disruptive effects upon their business, which would likely impact our sales and cause a decline in our revenue.\nWe do not maintain sufficient business interruption and other insurance policies to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any losses or damages incurred by us\nas a result of a catastrophic event or any other significant uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n13\nTable of Contents\nPandemics or other widespread public health problems could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in a material way.\nPandemics, epidemics, or other widespread public health problems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our business. Outbreaks have, and\ncould again, result in significant government measures to control the spread of disease, including, among others, restrictions on travel, manufacturing, and the movement of\nemployees. If, for example, pandemics were to occur in ways that significantly disrupt the manufacture, shipment, and purchasing of our products or the products of our\ncustomers, this may materially negatively impact our operating results and our overall business. Disruptions to manufacturing and shipping could also constrain our supplies,\nleading to operational delays, disruptions and inflationary pressures.\nThe ultimate impact of a pandemic and its potential effects on our business depends on many factors that are not within our control. This could lead to further\ndisruptions or restrictions on our ability to source, manufacture or distribute our products, including temporary disruptions to the facilities of our contract manufacturers in\nChina, Taiwan, the Philippines and Singapore, or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers globally. Additionally, multiple countries have imposed and may\nfurther impose restrictions on business operations and movement of people and products to limit the spread of a pandemic. Delays in production or delivery of components or\nraw materials that are part of our global supply chain due to restrictions imposed to limit the spread of a pandemic could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain the supply of\ncomponents and finished goods. If the impact of a pandemic becomes more severe in the locations where we, our customers or suppliers conduct business, or we experience\nmore pronounced disruptions in our operations, we may experience constrained supply or curtailed demand that may materially adversely impact our business, cash flows, and\nresults of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse income fluctuations, affect our reported financial results or how we conduct\nour business.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) are promulgated by and are subject to the interpretation of the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (“FASB”) and the SEC. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices\nhave occurred and may occur in the future. Any future changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may have a significant effect on how we report our\nresults and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. In addition, a review of existing or prior accounting practices may result in a\nchange in previously reported amounts. This change to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial\nresults, our ability to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or the way we conduct our business and subject us to regulatory inquiries or litigation.\nWe may have increased difficulty attracting and retaining qualified outside board members.\nThe directors and management of publicly traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits and shareholder\nclaims, as well as governmental and creditor claims that may be made against them in connection with their positions with publicly held companies. Outside directors are\nbecoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending shareholder claims.\nDirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain. The SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market have also imposed higher independence standards and\ncertain special requirements on directors of public companies. Accordingly, it may become increasingly difficult to attract and retain qualified outside directors to serve on our\nboard of directors.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe may be unable to accurately estimate quarterly revenue, which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock.\nDue to our relatively long product delivery cycle and the inability of our customers in the rapidly evolving end markets to confirm product requirements on a timely\nbasis, we may have low visibility to product demand or estimated revenue in any given quarter. If our customers cannot provide us with accurate delivery lead times, we may\nnot be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion. Furthermore, our ability to respond to increased demand is limited to inventories on hand or on order, the\ncapacity available at our contract manufacturers, and our capacity to program products to customer specifications. If we fail to accurately estimate customer demand, or if our\navailable capacity is less than needed to meet customer demand, we may not be able to accurately estimate our quarterly revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on\nour results of operations and financial condition, and our stock price could be materially fluctuate as a result.\nIf we do not maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted, which could, among other things, reduce the\nprice of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued\nlisting requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders' equity, minimum share\nprice, and certain corporate governance requirements.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. In the event that our common stock is\ndelisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an\nelectronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Markets. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain\naccurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the\nprice of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and could lead to securities litigation.\nStock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating\nperformance of such companies. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of\ntheir securities. In the future, we may be the subject of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover that is beneficial to stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law could have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts that certain stockholders might\ndeem to be in their interest. These anti-takeover provisions may make us a less attractive target for a takeover bid or merger, potentially depriving shareholders of an\nopportunity to sell their shares of common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices as a result of a takeover bid or merger.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIf, in the future, we conclude our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which\ncould result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the\ncompanies’ internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K, including an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the filing company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public company’s financial statements must attest to the\neffectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. There is a risk that in the future, we may identify internal control deficiencies that suggest that our\ncontrols are no longer effective. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which\ncould cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Global and Economic Conditions\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and has experienced significant consolidation, and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive opportunities\nfor consolidation, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry depends on elements both within and outside of our control. We face\nsignificant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. In\naddition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our competitive position could be weakened relative to our peers, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations. Our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer\nacceptance of our products, and our ability to increase our position in our current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance.\nProducts or technologies developed by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We also may be unable to market and sell our products\nif they are not competitive on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, features, system compatibility, customized design, innovation, availability, delivery timing and\nreliability. If we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support, our sales and revenue may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers.\nLarger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to identify attractive\nopportunities to acquire companies to expand our business. Consolidation among competitors and integration among customers could erode our market share, impair our\ncapacity to compete and require us to restructure operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may receive governmental subsidies or other incentives that give them a competitive advantage over us. For example, the U.S.\nand the European Union have enacted legislation to provide funding and incentives for semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing in their respective regions. If\nwe are unable to access such funding or incentives, or if our competitors receive more funding or incentives than we do, we may be at a disadvantage in developing and\nproducing new or improved products or technologies, which could adversely affect our market share, revenue and profitability.\nThe semiconductor business is subject to downward price pressure.\nHistorically, the market for our products has been characterized by declining selling prices. With the recent supply chain shortages and materials price increases, we\nanticipate that our average selling prices will fluctuate in future periods, although the timing and amount of these fluctuations cannot be predicted with any certainty. The\npricing pressure in the semiconductor industry in past years has been due to a large number of factors, many of which were not easily foreseeable, such as industry-wide excess\nmanufacturing capacity, weak economic growth, and at times, the slowdown in capital spending. Similar to past years, recent unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in\na tightening of the credit markets. If signs of improvement in the global economy do not progress as expected and global economic conditions worsen, we may experience a\ndecline in our average selling prices. In addition, our competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, lower prices in order to increase their market share. Despite the\nrecent industry-wide price increases being implemented, prices may reduce in the future as the supply chain becomes more normalized again. In that event, downward price\npressure in the industry may harm our competitive position and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nGlobal supply chain constraints have not had a material impact on our business. While we have experienced some volatilities with input material costs and supplier\ncosts in accordance with domestic and global economic conditions, none of these have had a material impact to our business during our Fiscal 2023 year. We do not expect\nmaterial increases in costs over the next twelve months. However, we expect to be subject to continued, broader-based inflationary, labor, and supplier cost increases in\nalignment with domestic and global economic conditions. We expect any increases in costs to be dilutive to our gross profit and we may be limited in our ability to offset any\nincreased costs with price increases to customers. This may have a negative impact on our results from operations and cash flows.\nBoth we and our customers are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements, changes to which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nBoth we and our customers are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements that affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including,\nbut not limited to, the areas of commerce, import and export control, financial disclosures, intellectual property, income and other taxes, anti-trust, anti-corruption, labor,\nenvironmental, health, and safety. Our compliance in these areas may be costly, especially in areas where there are inconsistencies between the various jurisdictions in which\nwe operate. While we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers or\nagents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Any such violation or alleged violation could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\ncash flows, and results of operations. Any changes or potential changes to laws, regulations, or similar requirements, or our ability to respond to these changes, may\nsignificantly increase our costs to maintain compliance or result in our decision to limit our business, products, or jurisdictions in which we operate, any of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Federal and state regulatory agencies, including the United States Federal Communications\nCommission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions, regulate most of our domestic telecommunications customers. Similar\ngovernment oversight also exists in the international market. While we may not be directly affected by this legislation, such regulation of our customers may negatively impact\nour business. For instance, the sale of our products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of our customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of\ntelecommunications services. These regulations are continuously reviewed and changed by the various governmental agencies. Changes in current or future laws or regulations,\nin the United States or elsewhere, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions regarding certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, mined\nfrom the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These provisions require companies to undertake due diligence procedures and report on the use of conflict\nminerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Compliance with these provisions has caused and will continue to cause us to incur costs to\ndetermine whether our supply chain is conflict-free, and we may face difficulties if our suppliers are unwilling or unable to verify the source of their materials. Our ability to\nsource these minerals and metals may also be adversely impacted. In addition, our customers may require that we provide them with a certification and our inability to do so\nmay disqualify us as a supplier.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nIf we fail to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products and other new solutions or if our design opportunities do not generate the revenue we expect, we may be\nunable to compete effectively in the future and our future gross margins and operating results will be lower.\nThe market for differentiated IP and semiconductor products is highly competitive and dynamic. To compete successfully, we must obtain access to advanced\nfabrication capacity and dedicate significant resources to specify, design, develop, manufacture and sell new or enhanced solutions that provide increasingly higher levels of\nperformance, low power consumption, new features meeting current and emerging industry standards, reliability and/or cost savings to our customers. Our revenue is subject to\nfluctuation in a short period of time and our ability to grow our business depends on accelerating our design win activity. We often make significant investments in eFPGA IP\ndevelopment, software and silicon platform development, selling and marketing, long before we generate revenue, if any, from our efforts. Some of the markets we are targeting\ntypically have higher volumes and greater price pressure than our traditional business. In addition, we quote opportunities in anticipation of future cost reductions and may\naggressively price products to gain market share. In order to react quickly to opportunities or to obtain favorable wafer prices, we make significant investments in and\ncommitments to purchase inventories and capital equipment before we have firm commitments from customers.\nWe expect our business growth to be driven by new products, which currently include our eFPGA IP licenses and professional services, EOS™, QuickAI™,\nSensiML Analytics Toolkit, ArcticLink® III, PolarPro®3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II products. The new product revenues growth of our new products needs to be\nstrong enough to achieve profitability. The gross margin associated with our eFPGA IP is generally higher than the gross margin of our devices. Within our device revenue,\ngross margins of mature products, as well as new products sold to Aerospace and Defense customers, are generally higher than when selling the same products to higher volume\nIoT and/or Consumer customers. While we expect revenue and gross profit growth from new products will offset the expected decline in revenue and gross profit from our\nmature products, there is no assurance whether or when this will occur. In order to increase our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our\nexisting new products, especially solutions based on our eFPGA IP, EOS S3, ArcticLink and PolarPro solution platforms, and the development of additional new products and\nsolutions.\nIf (i) we are unable to design, produce and sell new products and other products and solutions that meet design specifications, address customer requirements, and\ngenerate sufficient revenue and gross profit; (ii) market demand for our new products and other products fails to materialize; (iii) we are unable to obtain adequate fabrication\ncapacity on a timely basis; (iv) we are unable to develop new silicon platforms or solutions in a timely manner; or (v) our customers do not successfully introduce products\nincorporating our hardware products, or choose a competing offering, our revenue and gross margin of the new products will be materially harmed, which could have an overall\nadverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf a market for our new products does not develop, or if our products do not meet customer needs, the loss of or reduction in orders could adversely affect our revenue and\nharm our business's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\neFPGA: We have history and experience in developing, selling, and supporting FPGA products and incorporating FPGA IP developed by us into our platform\nsolutions. The eFPGA market is a developing market with unknown requirements and demand. Our current FPGA architectures and their performance may not be a good fit for\nthe eFPGA Market. eFPGA IP is designed for specific foundry/process node combinations, and the ones we have chosen to target may be different from what our customers\nrequire. The software developed by us for eFPGA may be delayed or may not meet the needs of the eFPGA Market. The support required by a customer to incorporate the\neFPGA may be much higher than expected which may delay new engagements or lead to higher costs. The incorporated eFPGA IP may have an unexpected result in the\ncustomer’s chip leading to compensation demands. The expected NRE and royalty rates we expect to charge for the eFPGA may not be competitive, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSensiML: Mainstream AI runs on powerful processors and large FPGAs. SensiML’s AI solution targets end-point solutions that use low-power processors. The end-\npoint AI market is a developing market with unknown requirements and demand. The current SensiML solution may not be a good fit to the evolving needs of the end-point AI\nmarket. The support required for customer evaluations and implementation may be higher than expected, which may delay engagements and lead to higher costs. The expected\nSaaS licensing fees and royalty rates we expect to charge for the SensiML solutions may not be competitive, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nIf our AI products are not low touch, the cost of addressing the fragmented AI market will be high which will delay market penetration, result in reduced revenues or require\nincreased expenses, any of which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our business financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nThe end-point AI market consists of many different use cases, with each individual use case having a modest volume even though the aggregate volume is large.\nThis is quite different from the IoT consumer market which consists of a few large customers and use cases. In order to scale in the fragmented AI end-point market, our\nproducts will have to be extremely low touch so that the cost of support is low and scalable across many customers. The current EOS S3AI solution and SensiML solutions may\nnot be sufficiently low touch to address this market in a cost-effective manner, or in the volume required. Higher than expected costs, or lower than expected volume may have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and resources on the\ndesign of their products.\nOur customers often evaluate our products for six months or more before designing them into their systems, and they may not commence volume shipments for up\nto an additional six to twelve months, if at all. During this lengthy sales cycle, our potential customers may cancel or change their product plans. Customers may also\ndiscontinue products incorporating our hardware products at any time or they may choose to replace our products with lower-cost semiconductors. In addition, we are working\nwith leading customers in our target markets to define our future products. If customers cancel, reduce or delay product orders from us, or choose not to release products that\nincorporate our hardware products after we have spent substantial time and resources developing products or assisting customers with their product design, our revenue levels\nmay be less than anticipated and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products, we may incur product shortages or excess product inventories.\nOur agreements with certain suppliers require us to provide forecasts of our anticipated manufacturing orders, and place binding manufacturing commitments in\nadvance of receiving purchase orders from our customers. We are limited in our ability to increase or decrease our forecasts under such agreements. Other manufacturers supply\nus with products on a purchase order basis. The allocation of capacity is determined solely by our suppliers, over which we have no direct control. Additionally, we may place\norders with our suppliers in advance of customer orders to allow us to quickly respond to changing customer demand or to obtain favorable product costs. Furthermore, we\nprovide our suppliers with equipment that is used to program our products to customer specifications. The programming equipment is manufactured to our specifications and\nhas significant order lead times. These factors may result in product shortages or excess product inventories. Obtaining additional supply in the face of product, programming\nequipment or capacity shortages may be costly, or not possible, especially in the short-term since most of our products and programming equipment are supplied by a single\nsupplier. If we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products, our business, the relationship with our customers, our results of operations and financial condition could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by undetected errors or defects in our products.\nDifficulties encountered during the complex semiconductor manufacturing process can render a substantial percentage of semiconductor hardware products\nnonfunctional. New manufacturing techniques or fluctuations in the manufacturing process may change the performance, distribution, and yield of our products. We have, in the\npast, experienced manufacturing runs that have contained substantially reduced or no functioning hardware products, or that generated hardware products with below-normal\nperformance characteristics. Our reliance on third-party suppliers may extend the period of time required to analyze and correct these problems. Once corrected, our customers\nmay be required to redesign or re-qualify their products. As a result, we may incur substantially higher manufacturing costs, shortages of inventories, or reduced customer\ndemand.\nYield fluctuations frequently occur in connection with the manufacture of newly introduced products, with changes in product architecture, with manufacturing at\nnew facilities, on new fabrication processes, or in conjunction with new back-end manufacturing processes. Newly introduced solutions and products are often more complex\nand more difficult to produce, increasing the risk of manufacturing-related defects. New manufacturing facilities or processes are often more complex and take a period of time\nto achieve the expected quality levels and manufacturing efficiencies. While we test our products, including our software development tools, they may still contain errors or\ndefects that are found after we have commenced commercial production. Undetected errors or defects may also result from new manufacturing processes or when new\nintellectual property is incorporated into our products. If our products or software development tools contain undetected or unresolved defects, we may lose market share,\nexperience delays in or loss of market acceptance, reserve or scrap inventories, or be required to issue a product recall. In addition, we would be at risk of product liability\nlitigation if defects in our products were discovered. Although we attempt to limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special, consequential, and indirect damages\nand similar provisions, we cannot provide assurance that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable.\nWe will be unable to compete effectively if we fail to anticipate product opportunities based upon emerging technologies and standards or fail to develop products and solutions\nthat incorporate these technologies and standards in a timely manner.\nWe spend significant resources designing and developing silicon solution platforms, IP and software and reference designs, and adopting emerging technologies. We\nintend to develop additional products and solutions and to adopt new technologies in the future. If system manufacturers adopt alternative standards or technologies, if an\nindustry standard or emerging technology that we have targeted fails to achieve broad market acceptance, if customers choose low-power offerings from our competitors, or if\nwe are unable to bring the technologies or solutions to market in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may be unable to generate significant revenue from our research and\ndevelopment efforts. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to write off related\ninventories and long-lived assets.\nRising concern of international tariffs, as well as potential export restrictions, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to recent trade tariffs, if U.S. export controls expand to place new restrictions on the exportation of our products or a subset of our products, such controls\ncould have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers may, in the future, cause some of our\ncustomers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers.\nFurther, changes in United States trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, which could impose restrictions on our ability to do business in\nor with affected countries or prohibit, reduce, or discourage purchases of our products by foreign customers, leading to increased costs of products that contain our components,\nincreased costs of manufacturing our products, and higher prices of our products in foreign markets. Changes in, and responses to, United States trade policy could reduce the\ncompetitiveness of our products and cause our sales and revenues to drop, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nWe denominate sales of our products to foreign countries exclusively in U.S. dollars. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local\ncurrency of a foreign country will increase the price of our products in that country so that our products become relatively more expensive to customers in their local currency,\nwhich may cause sales of our products in that foreign country to decline. If the local currency of a foreign country in which we conduct business strengthens against the U.S.\ndollar, our payroll and other local expenses will be higher, and since sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, would not be offset by any increase in revenue. To the extent any such\nrisks materialize, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have implemented import and export control procedures to comply with United States regulations, but we are still exposed to potential risks from import and export activity.\nOur products, solutions, technology and software are subject to import and export control laws and regulations which, in some instances, may impose restrictions on\nbusiness activities, or otherwise require licenses or other authorizations from agencies such as the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury. These restrictions may impact deliveries to customers or limit development and manufacturing alternatives. We have import and export licensing\nand compliance procedures in place for purposes of conducting our business consistent with U.S. and applicable international laws and regulations, and we periodically review\nthese procedures to maintain compliance with the requirements relating to import and export regulations. If we are not able to remain in compliance with import and export\nregulations, we might be subject to investigation, sanctions or penalties by regulatory authorities. Such penalties can include civil, criminal or administrative remedies such as\nloss of export privileges. We cannot be certain as to the outcome of an evaluation, investigation, inquiry or other action or the impact of these items on our operations. Any such\naction could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\n17\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Customers and Partners\nWe currently depend on a limited number of significant customers, for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or reduction in orders from, such significant\ncustomers could adversely affect our revenue and harm our business financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA small number of end-customers represented a significant portion of our total revenue in our Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023. During our Fiscal Year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 70% of our total revenue. We expect this high level of customer concentration to decrease as we continue to market our\nsolutions to additional Aerospace and Defense, Industrial, Computing and Communications customers. As in the past, future demand from this customer may fluctuate\nsignificantly from quarter to quarter. Customers typically order products with short, requested delivery lead times, and do not provide a commitment to purchase products past\nthe period covered by purchase orders, which may be rescheduled or canceled. In addition, our manufacturing lead times are longer than the delivery lead times requested by\nthese customers, and we make significant purchases of inventory and capital expenditures in anticipation of future demand. If revenue from any significant customer were to\ndecline substantially, we may be unable to offset this decline with increased revenue and gross margin from other customers and we may purchase excess inventories. These\nfactors could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may make a significant investment in long-lived assets for the production of our products based upon historical and expected demand. If demand for our\nproducts or gross margin generated from our products does not meet our expectations or if we are unable to collect amounts due from significant customers, we may be required\nto write off inventories, provide for uncollectible accounts receivable or incur charges against long-lived assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon partnering with other companies to offer voice, motion, and other solutions into our platform.\nIn addition to working directly with our customers, we partner with other companies that are experts in certain technologies to create more complete solutions. The\ndepth of these relationships varies depending on the partner and the dynamics of the end market being targeted, but these relationships are typically a co-marketing relationship\nthat includes joint account calls, promotional activities, and/or engineering collaboration and developments. The propriety code provided by these partners may be an integral\npart of the solutions that we offer our customers. If we are unable to obtain competitive pricing (NRE, royalty) and prompt quality support from our partner, our solution may\nnot be competitive. In addition, if the quality of our partner’s solution does not meet our customer’s requirements, it may delay or prevent the incorporation of our product by\nthe customer. There may also be delays and additional expenses to improve or update the partner’s solution to meet current market needs. If we are unable to maintain a close\nworking relationship with our partners, it would hinder our ability to continue to develop and introduce leading solutions effectively in the future, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend on our relationships with third parties to manufacture our new hardware products.\nWe depend upon GlobalFoundries, TSMC, SkyWater Technologies, Honeywell Aerospace, Amkor Technology, Inc., Integra Specialty Products, JCET Group Co.\nLtd., and Golden Altos Corp. to manufacture our new hardware products. The inability of any one of these companies to continue manufacture of our new hardware products\nfor any reason would require us to identify and qualify a new foundry to manufacture our new hardware products. This would be time-consuming, difficult, and result in\nunforeseen operational problems. Alternate foundries might not be available to fabricate our new hardware products, or if available, might be unwilling or unable to offer\nservices on acceptable terms and our ability to operate our business or deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired.\nWe depend upon third parties for silicon IP, RTL, design, physical design, verification and assembly of our silicon platforms and any failure to meet our requirements in a\ntimely fashion may adversely affect our time to market and revenue.\nOur move to a variable cost or outsourced engineering development model allows us access to the best design resources for developing new silicon platforms. This\nincludes access to leading edge silicon IP, as well as RTL design and physical design expertise. However, outsourcing the design of a complex silicon platform typically\ninvolves multiple companies in multiple locations, which may increase the risk of costly design errors. Any delays or errors in the design of our new silicon platforms could\nsignificantly increase the cost of development, as well as adversely affect our time to market, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nand financial condition.\nWe depend upon partnering with other companies to develop IP, reference platforms, algorithms and system software.\nIn addition to working directly with our customers, we partner with other companies that are experts in certain technologies to develop additional intellectual\nproperty, reference platforms, algorithms, and system software to provide application solutions. We also work with IoT processor manufacturers and companies that supply\nsensor, storage, networking or graphics components for embedded systems. The depth of these relationships varies depending on the partner and the dynamics of the end market\nbeing targeted but is typically a co-marketing relationship that includes joint account calls, promotional activities and/or engineering collaboration and developments, such as\nreference designs. If we are unable to license new technologies or maintain a close working relationship with our partners, fail to continue to develop and introduce leading\ntechnologies, or if these technologies fail to generate the revenue we expect, we may not be able to compete effectively in the future, which may have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend upon third parties to fabricate, assemble, test and program our products, and to provide logistics services. Any problems with these third parties could adversely\naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe contract with third parties to fabricate, assemble, test, and program our hardware products, and vendors for logistics. In general, each of our hardware products is\nfabricated, assembled and programmed by a single supplier, and the loss of a supplier, transfer of manufacturing to a new location, expiration of a supply agreement, or the\ninability of our suppliers to manufacture our products to meet volume, performance, quality, and cost targets could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our\nrelationship with our suppliers could change as a result of a merger or acquisition. If for any reason these suppliers or any other vendor becomes unable or unwilling to continue\nto provide services of acceptable quality, at acceptable costs, and in a timely manner, our ability to operate our business or deliver our products to our customers could be\nseverely impaired. We would have to identify and qualify substitute suppliers, which could be time-consuming, difficult, and result in unforeseen operational problems, or we\ncould announce an end-of-life program for these products. Alternate suppliers might not be available to fabricate, assemble, test, and program our hardware products or, if\navailable, might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms. In addition, if competition for wafer manufacturing capacity increases, if we need to migrate to\nmore advanced wafer manufacturing technology, or if competition for assembly services increases, we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to\nthis capacity. The number of companies that provide these services is limited and some of them have limited operating histories and financial resources. In the event our current\nsuppliers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us, or if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity from our current suppliers on commercially reasonable\nterms, we may be unable to procure services from alternate suppliers in a timely manner, if at all. Moreover, our reliance on a limited number of suppliers subjects us to reduced\ncontrol over delivery schedules, quality assurance, and costs. This lack of control may cause unforeseen product shortages or may increase our costs to manufacture and test our\nproducts.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize third-party logistics services, including transportation, warehouse and shipping services. These service providers are subject to interruptions that affect\ntheir ability to service us, including the availability of transportation services, disruptions related to work stoppages, volatility in fuel prices, and security incidents or natural\nevents at manufacturing, shipping or receiving points, or along transportation routes.\nIn the event any of our third-party suppliers or vendors were to experience financial, operational, production, or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction\nor interruption in supply or providing services to us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe entered into informal partnerships with certain third parties for the development of solutions. Our business could be adversely affected if such informal partnerships fail to\ngrow as we expected.\nOur approach to developing solutions for potential customers involves developing solutions for and aligning our roadmap with application processor, sensor, and\nflash memory vendors. We have entered into informal partnerships with other parties that involve the development of solutions that interface with their hardware products or\nstandards. These informal partnerships also may involve joint marketing campaigns and sales calls. If the informal partnerships do not grow as expected or if they are\nsignificantly reduced or terminated by acquisition or other means, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we\nmay be required to write-off related inventories and long-lived assets.\nOur solutions face competition from suppliers of ASSPs, suppliers of integrated application processors, low-power FPGAs, low-power MCUs, and suppliers of ASICs,\nsuppliers of eFPGA IP.\nWe face competition from companies that offer ASSPs. While it is difficult to provide a unique solution through the use of ASSPs, ASSPs generally are cost-\neffective standard products with short lead times. In certain design opportunities, ASSPs can be combined to achieve system design objectives. Manufacturers of integrated\napplication processors often integrate new features when they introduce new products. A system designer could elect the use of an integrated processor that includes the features\noffered in our solutions and/or a widely accepted feature of our solutions could be integrated into a competitor’s ASSP. Some vendors offer low-power FPGAs that can be\nadopted by an IoT device for hardware differentiation that is similar in functionality, physical size, power consumption, and price to what we offer with our programmable\nlogic-based solutions. We also face competition from low-power MCU companies. While MCUs cannot be customized at the hardware level for product differentiation, they do\nhave the ability to run custom software algorithms written in standard C code, which may yield similar functionality to what we can provide with our products. Companies that\nsupply ASICs, which may be purchased for a lower price at higher volumes, may have greater logic capacity, additional features, and higher performance than our products. In\naddition, we face competition from companies that provide sensor algorithm software, which may be licensed directly by an OEM, or licensed for use through an MCU\ncompany. If we are unable to successfully compete with companies that supply ASSPs, lower power FPGAs, MCUs, ASICs, eFPGA IP, or sensor algorithm software in any of\nthe following areas, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially adversely affected: (i) the development of new products, solutions, and\nadvanced manufacturing technologies; (ii) the quality, power characteristics, performance characteristics, price, and availability of hardware products, programming hardware,\nand software development tools; (iii) the ability to engage with companies that provide synergistic products and services, including algorithms that may be preloaded into our\ndevice at configuration; (iv) the incorporation of industry standards in our products and solutions; (v) the diversity of product offerings available to customers; and (vi) the\nquality and cost-effectiveness of design, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts.\nWe may engage in manufacturing, distribution or technology agreements that involve numerous risks, including the use of cash, erosion of margins due to royalty obligations or\nrevenue sharing and diversion of resources.\nWe have entered into and, in the future, intend to enter into agreements that involve numerous risks, including the use of significant amounts of our cash; royalty\nobligations or revenue sharing; diversion of resources from other development projects or market opportunities; our ability to collect amounts due under these contracts; and\nmarket acceptance of related products and solutions. If we fail to recover the cost of these or other assets from the cash flow generated by the related products, our assets will\nbecome impaired, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have entered and will continue to enter into strategic licensing and collaborative partnerships and relationships with third parties. The anticipated benefits of these\npartnerships and relationships may never materialize and these partnerships and relationships may instead disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe have entered into strategic licensing and collaborative partnerships and relationships with third parties and will continue to enter into such partnerships and\nrelationships with the goal of acquiring or gaining access to new and innovative semiconductor products and technologies, as well as other technologies which can be used to\nadd to the differentiation of our emerging products, on a timely basis. Negotiating and performing under these arrangements involves significant time and expense, and we\ncannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of these arrangements will ever materialize or that the products or technologies involved will ever be commercialized or\nthat, as a result, we will not have written down a portion or all of our investment. The arrangements with some third parties contain conditions and contingencies (such as a\ncondition to raise a certain amount of capital), and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet all the conditions under these arrangements. We may end up owing various\nobligations and commitments to third parties related to these arrangements. Such arrangements can magnify several risks for us, including loss of control over the development\nand development timeline of products being developed with third parties. Accordingly, we face increased risk that development activities may result in products that are not\ncommercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. In addition, any third-party with whom we enter into a development, product collaboration, or technology\nlicensing arrangement may fail to commit sufficient resources to the project, change its policies or priorities, and abandon or fail to perform its obligations related to the\ncollaboration. The failure to timely develop commercially successful products through our development projects or strategic investment activities as a result of any of these and\nother challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Other challenges and risks presented by use of strategic\npartnerships include the acquisition of a partner with which we have a strategic relationship by an unaffiliated third-party that either delays or jeopardizes the original intent of\nthe partnering relationship or investment.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, which requires registrants to disclose\nmaterial cybersecurity incidents they experience and to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and\ngovernance. For registrants, the final rules were effective September 5, 2023, with the new disclosures required beginning in annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after\nDecember 15, 2023. With respect to compliance with the incident disclosure requirements, all registrants other than smaller reporting companies must begin complying on\nDecember 18, 2023, with smaller reporting companies being given an additional 180 days, or June 15, 2024. The Company adopted these new cybersecurity disclosure\nrequirements in the current fiscal year, as detailed below.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) recognizes the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, clients, business\npartners and employees. The Board is actively involved in oversight of the Company’s risk management program, and cybersecurity represents an important component of the\nCompany’s overall approach to enterprise risk management (“ERM”). The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are fully integrated into the\nCompany’s ERM program and are based on recognized cybersecurity industry frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and other\napplicable industry standards. This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but only that we use these frameworks as a\nguide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. In general, the Company seeks to address cybersecurity risks through a\ncomprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that the Company collects and stores by\nidentifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. Additionally, we utilize internal and external\nindependent controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, including a Security Incident Response Plan (\"SIRP\") and periodic Information Technology training for\nall employees.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nAs one of the critical elements of the Company’s overall ERM approach, the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program includes the following key\ncomponents:\n• Risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment.\n• The IT team including its executive leadership is in charge of managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls, and (iii) our\nresponse to security incidents.\n• The Company deploys technical safeguards that are designed to protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls,\nintrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through vulnerability assessments\nand cybersecurity threat intelligence.\n• The Company has in place an incident response and recovery plan that addresses the Company’s response to a cybersecurity incident.\n• The Company maintains a comprehensive, risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by external resources accessing the\nCompany’s systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-\nparty systems.\n• The Company provides regular, mandatory training for personnel regarding cybersecurity threats as a means to equip the Company’s personnel with effective tools\nto address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate the Company’s evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices.\nThe Company engages in the periodic assessment and testing of the Company’s policies, standards, processes and practices that are designed to address\ncybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, EDR tools, and PEN test exercises that focus on evaluating\nthe effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. The Company regularly engages third parties to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including\naudits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to\nthe executive management team and the Board, and the Company adjusts its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information\nprovided by these assessments, audits and reviews.\nWe experienced a cyberattack in January 2023. We believe the incident has not had nor will have a material impact on our business, operations, ability to serve our\ncustomers, or financial results. At this time, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have\nmaterially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. The impact of potential cybersecurity threats is difficult to\npredict, but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities, harm to individuals or property, damage to our reputation, loss of business, regulatory\nactions, and potential liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. These threats could lead to\nlosses of sensitive information or capabilities, harm to personnel, infrastructure, or products, and/or damage to our reputation as well as our vendor’s ability to perform on our\ncontracts. See “Risk Factors - Cyberattacks, like our 2023 cybersecurity incident, can lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm\nto our reputation or competitive position.\"\nGovernance\nThe executive management team and the Board oversee the Company’s ERM process, including the management of risks arising from cybersecurity threats. The\nexecutive management team and the Board each receive regular presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics including recent\ndevelopments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security\nconsiderations arising with respect to the Company’s peers and third parties.

[RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties including\nthose discussed under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking\nstatements.\nOverview\nQuickLogic Corporation was founded in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We provide innovative, programmable silicon and software platforms to\nenable our customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, we are a fabless semiconductor company with a variety\nof products: embedded FPGA (\"eFPGA\") intellectual property (\"IP\"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips (\"SoCs\"), discrete FPGAs, and AI software. Our\ncustomers can use our eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products, our SoCs to run our customers'\nsoftware and build their hardware around, and our discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML Corporation (\"SensiML\"), our\nwholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of\nplatforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor processing across Aerospace, and Defense, Consumer/Industrial\nIoT, and Consumer Electronics markets.\nOur new products include the following: eFPGA IP Licensing business, associated professional services, consisting of development and integration of eFPGA\ntechnology into custom semiconductor solutions, our silicon products consisting of EOS™, QuickAI™, ArcticLink® III, PolarPro®3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II\nproducts. In addition to delivering our own semiconductor solutions, our new products category includes our AI/ML Software Platform from our wholly-owned subsidiary\ncompany, SensiML, which includes Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions for development, per unit license fees when deployed in production, and proof-of-concept\nservices, all of which are also included in the new products revenue category. Our mature products include primarily FPGA families named PASIC®3 and QuickRAM®, as\nwell as programming hardware and design software.\nFor our IP and silicon platforms, we collaborate with multiple partners on co-marketing and/or co-selling initiatives. These partners could have primary business\nlines in semiconductor IP, Design Services, semiconductor foundry, semiconductor assembly and test, and others. For our AI/ML Software, SensiML collaborates with several\nmicrocontroller and sensor manufacturers to integrate the microcontroller and/or sensor manufacturers’ development kits with SensiML’s Analytics Toolkit in order to showcase\ncombined solutions for AI/ML applications. Currently, these collaborations include Infineon Technologies, On Semiconductor Corp., Microchip Technology Inc., Silicon\nLaboratories, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Arduino, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Raspberry Pi, and Nordic Semiconductor.\nOur eFPGA IP is currently developed on 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, 28nm, 40nm, 65nm, 90nm, 130nm, and 250nm process nodes with a roadmap to more advanced nodes.\nThe licensable IP is generated by our automated compiler tool called Australis™, which enables our engineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can then\nintegrate into their SoC without significant involvement by QuickLogic. We believe this flow enables a scalable development and support model for QuickLogic. For our\neFPGA strategy, we typically work with semiconductor manufacturing partners prior to this IP being licensed to a SoC company.\nWe have changed our manufacturing strategies to reduce the cost of our silicon solution platforms to enable their use in a range of unique products ranging from low\nto high volume. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, QuickAI and ArcticLink III silicon platforms combine mixed signal physical functions and hard-wired logic alongside our field\nprogrammable logic. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, and ArcticLink III solution platforms are manufactured on process nodes where we can benefit from smaller die sizes and lower\npower consumption. We typically implement sophisticated logic blocks and mixed signal functions in hard-wired logic because it is very cost-effective and energy efficient. We\nuse small form factor packages, which are less expensive to manufacture and include smaller pin counts. Reduced pin counts result in lower costs for our customers' printed\ncircuit board space and routing. Furthermore, our SRAM reprogrammable silicon platforms can be programmed in-system by our customers, and therefore, we do not incur\nprogramming costs, lowering the overall cost of ownership to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in silicon solution platforms and manufacturing technologies that\nmake us competitive for the variety of markets and applications that programmable logic serves.\nIn order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, including existing new product platforms and\nplatforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven mainly by eFPGA IP and our silicon solutions, with additional contributions from SensiML AI\nSoftware. Therefore, our revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sale, and marketing of\nour new solution platforms, IP, and software.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe market our programmable logic (FPGAs and eFPGA IP) solutions primarily to Defense Industrial Base contractors, U.S. Government entities, System OEMs,\nand fabless semiconductor companies. These customers may value one or more of our product categories. A solution can be based on our programmable technology, which\nenables customized designs, low power, flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market, and lower total cost of ownership. We are capable of providing complete\nsolutions because of our investment in developing the low power IP and software required to implement specific functions, along with sensor software algorithms optimized for\nour architecture. In some cases, we develop the IPs and either software or firmware ourselves and, in other cases, we utilize third parties to develop the mixed signal physical\nlayers, logic, and/or software.\nWe market our SoC and SensiML solutions to OEMs and ODMs offering differentiated Consumer/IoT products, to processor vendors wishing to expand their served\navailable market, and to sensor manufacturers and sensor processing software companies wishing to expand their ecosystems. Our target markets for our SoC and SensiML\nproducts include Consumer/Industrial IoT and Consumer Electronics.\nBy using our silicon platforms, our IPs, our software, and our in-depth architecture knowledge, we can deliver energy efficient custom solutions that blend the\nbenefits of traditional ASSPs with the flexibility, product proliferation, differentiation, and low total cost of ownership advantages of programmable logic.\nWe monetize our technology through hardware product sales and eFPGA IP licenses, with any necessary corresponding work delivered via professional engineering\nservices, SensiML Analytics Toolkit subscriptions, and per unit royalties. We specialize in enhancing the user experience in leading edge IoT hardware products. For our\ncustomers, we enable hardware and sensor algorithmic differentiation quickly, cost-effectively, and at low power. For our partners, we expand their reach into new segments and\nnew use cases, thereby expanding the served available market for their existing hardware products.\nOur embedded FPGA technology gives ASIC and SoC developers the benefit of flexibility to make design changes post-manufacturing changes at very fast time-to-\nand time-in-market, while keeping power consumption low. Our multi-core sensor processing products such as ArcticLink 3 S1, ArcticLink 3 S2, EOS 3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS\nS3AI provide an extremely power-efficient approach for real-time multi-modal (vision, motion, voice, location, biometric, and environmental) sensor processing independently\nof the cloud. Our SensiML Analytics Toolkit is cutting-edge software that enables ultra-low power IoT endpoints that implement AI to transform raw sensor data into\nmeaningful insight at the device itself. The toolkit also provides an end-to-end development platform spanning data collection, labeling, algorithm and firmware auto\ngeneration, and testing.\nWe recognize that our markets require a range of solutions, and we intend to work with market-leading companies to combine silicon solution platforms, packaging\ntechnology, FPGA User Tools, sensor software algorithms, software drivers and firmware, to meet the product proliferation, high bandwidth, time-to-market, time-in-market,\nand form factor requirements of our customers. We intend to continue to define and implement compelling solutions for our target customers and partners.\nWe believe our solutions are resonating with our target customers who value lower power consumption, platform design flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer\ntime-in-market, and low total cost of ownership available through the use of our solutions.\nWe sell our products through a network of sales managers in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, we\nhave international sales operations in Japan and the United Kingdom. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and application support\nfor a given region, focusing on major strategic accounts, and managing our channel sales partners such as distributors.\nCustomers typically order our products through our distributors. Currently, we have eight active distributors in North America and a network of seventeen active\ndistributors and sales representatives throughout Europe and Asia to support our international business. eFPGA IP customers and SensiML SaaS subscribers typically enter into\nlicensing agreements directly with QuickLogic and SensiML, respectively.\nWe also have an Aerospace and Defense, industrial, and IoT product customer base that purchases our mature silicon products. We expect to continue to offer silicon\nhardware products to these customers, as well as new eFPGA IP for when these customers choose to implement their own silicon platform solution.\nNew products revenue for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 was $18.2 million, an increase of $6.5 million as compared to the Fiscal Year ended January 1,\n2023. Of the $18.2 million in new products revenue, approximately $16.8 million was generated from eFPGA IP revenue, primarily eFPGA-related professional engineering\nservices, as compared to approximately $7.5 million in the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023. Mature products revenue for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 was $3.0\nmillion, a decrease of $1.5 million compared to the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023. We shipped new products into multiple end market segments including Aerospace and\nDefense, Industrial, IoT, Consumer, and SaaS revenue from the new Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") market beginning in the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023. We reported a\nnet loss of $0.3 million for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a net loss of $4.3 million in the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe have experienced net losses in the past years and expect to experience losses in at least some of the fiscal quarters during 2024 as we continue to develop new\nproducts, applications, and technologies. Our new hardware products and hardware products currently under development are generating stable gross margins year over year\nand higher margins than our mature products due to the markets that we have targeted, and the larger order quantities associated with these new products. New eFPGA products\nhave been generating higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately\npredicted, and our investment portfolio is subject to a degree of interest rate and liquidity risk. Unless such cash flow levels are achieved, in addition to the $2.3 million and\n$3.5 million in proceeds that we received in March 2023and March 2024, respectively, from the sale of our equity securities, and the revolving line of credit we may be able to\ndraw down from Heritage Bank of Commerce, we may need to obtain additional funds through strategic divestiture, or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination\nthereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nImpact of Supply Chain Disruptions on Business\nWe continue to experience increased product and logistics costs and impacts from the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply\nshortage is due, in part, to increased demand across multiple industries resulting in a slowdown in production schedules. The semiconductor supply shortage is also impacting\nour supply chain and our ability to meet demand for some of our customers.\nOur employees and customers\nQuickLogic nurtures a culture of teams of employees operating in a committed, execution-oriented, and globally collaborative environment. Our close-knit, family-\noriented team welcomes and encourages all perspectives and ideas to improve and innovate in our space, providing exciting career opportunities for the future of technology.\nCollaboration is deeply ingrained in how we work with each other and our customers. We offer competitive compensation and benefits. Many of our personnel work from home\nexcept a few personnel required for minimum operations. We embrace remote work and enable our employees to do their best work from anywhere in the United States,\nallowing them to balance their work obligations with their personal lives. We are committed to our customers to provide the support they need to continue providing vital\nservices and tools.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our\nconsolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of\noperations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAlthough these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ\nfrom these estimates and assumptions. Areas where we use subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, inventory valuation, including the\nidentification of excess quantities, market value, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. We believe that we apply judgments and\nestimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods\npresented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 and related Accounting Standards Updates (\"ASUs\").\nWe earn revenue from principal activities by (i) delivering standard hardware products, (2) delivering and providing eFPGA IP products and professional services,\n(iii) and providing software as a service to customers, as well as (iv) other miscellaneous revenue.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we apply a five-step model for recognizing revenue:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer,\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract,\n3. Determination of the transaction price. We estimate the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the performance obligations\nin the contract, which may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. Our contracts with customers containing variable consideration are\ngenerally sales-based royalties, which is fully constrained.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWhen entering into a new contract, we evaluate certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay, or credit risk.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a description of our revenue recognition policy by principal activity:\nHardware Product Revenue\nWe generate revenue by supplying standard hardware products, which must be programmed before they can be used in an application. Standard hardware products\nmay be programmed by us, distributors, end customers, or third parties. Contracts with customers for hardware products generally do not include other performance obligations\nsuch as services, extended warranties, or other material rights. Our promise to transfer hardware products is identified as a distinct performance obligation. We recognize\nrevenue on hardware products when we transfer control of the promised products to the customer. Transfer of control of hardware products occurs when our performance\nobligation is satisfied, which typically occurs upon shipment from our manufacturing site or headquarters. We recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products, which also represents the standalone selling price (SSP) of our performance obligation. Hardware product prices are fixed. We\nelected a practical expedient in which we do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component since our standard payment terms are less than one year. We\nallocate the transaction price of customer contracts to each distinct product based on its relative SSP. The sale of hardware products does not typically involve significant\njudgment or estimates by management. However, we do record an allowance for hardware product sales returns, which requires some judgment by management.\nWe recognized hardware product revenue of approximately $4.0 million, or 19% of total revenue, $8.1 million, or 50% of total revenue, and $9.6 million, or 76% of\ntotal revenue, in the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nHardware Product Sales Return Allowance\nWhile the terms and conditions of the sale of hardware products generally do not allow for refunds or product returns other than for warranty repairs, we do record\nan allowance for hardware product sales returns. The allowance for sales returns is based on a historical returns analysis of the prior four quarters that is performed on a\nquarterly basis. Amounts recorded for hardware product sales returns were $8 thousand, $2 thousand and a sales return reversal of $13 thousand for the years ended December\n31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, on our consolidated statements of operations. While hardware product sales returns have not been material to the\ncompany in recent reporting periods, we note there is an inherent uncertainty in estimating this allowance. In the case where actual results may significantly vary from\nmanagement estimates, we may be required to make future adjustments to our revenues and operating results.\neFPGA IP Revenue\neFPGA IP revenue is comprised of eFPGA intellectual property revenue, eFPGA-related professional services revenue, and eFPGA-related support and maintenance\nrevenue. We recognize eFPGA intellectual property revenue from licensing our eFPGA intellectual property to customers and recognize eFPGA-related professional\nservices revenue from the fees associated with the custom development and integration of our technology solutions into hardware products. We recognize eFPGA revenue from\nsupport and maintenance services for post-implementation customer support ratably over the service term. Renewals of support and maintenance contracts create new\nperformance obligations for which we recognize as revenue ratably over the service term. The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of eFPGA IP licenses and\nprofessional services.\neFPGA IP contractual arrangements often include promises to transfer intellectual property licenses, to customize hardware products, and to provide professional\nservices and technical support services. We must determine whether the promised goods and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for\nseparately or are a single, combined performance obligation and should be accounted for together. In accordance with ASC 606, we must evaluate whether the customer can\nbenefit from each good or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and whether the transfer of each good or service can be\nseparately identifiable. We also must evaluate when control of the performance obligation is transferred to and accepted by the customer. We note these determinations, in\naddition to identifying contractual terms and conditions within the contract including termination for convenience clauses, enforceable rights to payment for performance\ncompleted-to-date, and consideration of the alternative use of the asset require significant judgment. In these judgments, we consider the context of the contract, historical\nexperience with similar contracts, and the interdependency of the promised goods and services.\nAdditionally, judgment is required by management to allocation the transaction price to the separately identifiable performance obligations in the contract. We\nallocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. We rarely sell eFPGA intellectual property licenses on a standalone basis.\nGenerally, we will provide eFPGA-related professional services and support and maintenance services to customers in conjunction with eFPGA IP licenses based on unique\ncontractual arrangement terms and conditions. As such, we are required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation.\nIn instances where the SSP is not directly observable because we do not sell the promised goods or services separately, we typically determine the SSP using either\nthe adjusted market assessment approach or the expected cost plus a margin approach, depending on the characteristics and context of the deliverable. The selected method is\napplied by us consistently for similar arrangements and deliverables. The factors used to select the most appropriate estimation method, as well as select the most appropriate\nSSP include, but are not limited to, the extent of internal costs required to provide the promised performance obligation, margins achieved on standalone sales of similar\nproducts, profit objectives, cost structure, location-specific factors, and competition.\nIn other instances, we may have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and\ncircumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the\nvalue of its contracts, customer type, customer tier, type of the technology used, customer demographics, and geographic locations, among other factors. We also provide\neFPGA-related professional services on a time-and-material basis.\nGenerally, we satisfy eFPGA-related contractual performance obligations over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by\nour performance as we perform, our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as it is created or enhanced, or our performance does not create an\nasset with an alternative use to the company and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. When we satisfy performance obligations over\ntime, we recognize revenue by applying an over-time methodology that faithfully depicts our performance toward satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n25\nTable of Contents\nDue to the nature of the work performed under contractual arrangements, the selection and application of an over-time methodology is complex and involves\nsignificant judgment. In the case of the selection of an input method, the key factors reviewed by management to estimate costs to complete each contract include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated labor days-effort necessary to complete the project, budgeted hours, hourly cost to the company, profit margins, and engineering hours at cut-off when\nprojects extend beyond a reporting period. In the case of the selection of an output method, key factors reviewed by management include, but are not limited to, the specific\ndeliverables specified in the contracts with customers and the duration of performance, inclusive of delays. We have methods and controls in place for tracking labor-days\nincurred in completing eFPGA IP contracts, as well as quantifying changes in estimates used within the chosen methodology. We consider labor-days to be a critical estimate as\nany significant variation of labor and time required to complete a contractual arrangement could cause a revenue claw-back from prior periods and deferral of revenue to future\nperiods.\nWhen the expected consideration from a revenue contract with a customer is less than the expected costs of fulfilling the contract, we are required to first impair any\ncapitalized costs associated with the contract. We are also required to recognize a provision for contract losses as a liability on our balance sheet. This would result in an\nunfavorable impact to income from operations.\nWe recognized eFPGA IP revenue of approximately $16.8 million, or 79% of total revenue, $7.5 million, or 47% of total revenue, and $2.7 million, or 21% of total\nrevenue, in the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nSaaS and Other Revenue\nSaaS & Other Revenue is comprised primarily of software as a service (\"SaaS\") revenue and software-related professional services revenue. SaaS revenue is\ngenerated when we license our software to customers and allow customers to access the software over a short-term subscription basis. We grant the customer the right to access\nand use software at the outset of the arrangement and throughout the entire term of the arrangement. We recognize SaaS revenue ratably over the license term. We recognize\nrevenue from software-related professional services as services are provided to the customer.\nOther miscellaneous revenue is comprised primarily of royalties from licensing our technology. We recognize royalty revenue on the later of (i) the subsequent sale\nor usage, or (ii) satisfaction of a performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based royalty has been allocated.\nWe recognized SaaS and Other Revenue of approximately $0.4 million, or 2% of total revenue, $0.6 million, or 3% of total revenue, and $0.4 million, or 3% of total\nrevenue, in the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nPractical Expedients, Elections, and Exemptions\n• Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities and that are related to the sales of our products are excluded from revenues.\n• Sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general,\nand administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n• We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with original expected lengths of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which\nwe recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for the services performed.\nValuation of Inventories\nHardware product inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard cost approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We\nroutinely evaluate quantities and values of our inventories in light of current market conditions and trends and record reserves for quantities in excess of demand and for\nproduct obsolescence. The evaluation may take into consideration historic usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, the stage in the product life cycle of our customers’\nproducts, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer design activity, customer\nconcentrations, and product merchantability, among other factors. Actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand and this difference could have a\nmaterial impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventories or a benefit from inventories previously written\ndown. We also regularly review the cost of inventories against estimated market value and record a lower of cost or market reserve for inventories that have a cost in excess of\nestimated market value, which could have a material impact on our hardware product gross margin and hardware product inventory balances based on additional write-downs to\nnet realizable value or a benefit from inventories previously written down. Estimates of market value for our products require subjective criteria such as anticipated demand and\nmarket acceptance for unique products. Differences between these estimates and actual results could result in gross margin volatilities from period to period.\nOur hardware products have historically had an unusually long product life cycle and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories.\nHowever, as we continue to develop new products, we believe our new product life cycle may be shorter, which could increase the potential for obsolescence. A significant\ndecrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory on hand. Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand,\nany significant unanticipated changes in demand or frequent new product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of\noperations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The carrying value of our\ngoodwill is not amortized but is annually tested for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter, and more often if there is an indicator of impairment. We either perform a\nqualitative assessment under ASC 350, including the consideration of factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and overall financial\nperformance, or a quantitative assessment under ASU No. 2017-14, which involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Subsequent to our annual\nimpairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment that gave cause for additional impairment testing of goodwill. No\nimpairment of goodwill has been recognized to date.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property and equipment, software, tooling, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, and internal-use software. These assets are\nstated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, generally one to ten years, with the amortization period of internal-use software being generally five years and the amortization period of leasehold\nimprovements being the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three to five years. We note the estimation of the useful lives of\nour long-lived assets involves judgment and estimation by management. In the determination of an asset’s useful life, we consider the following factors: obsolescence,\ncompetition, historical product life cycles, and industry and market considerations, among others. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the useful life ranges of our\nlong-lived assets.\nWe recognize assets for pre-production design and development costs for which there is a contractual reimbursement by the customer. These assets are classified\nunder 'tooling' within property and equipment and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally seven years. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.\nWe capitalize costs related to the development and enhancement of hosted services we provide to our customers and the development and enhancement of other\ninternally used engineering software as internal-use software. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir useful lives, which are generally five to seven years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. We also capitalize costs related to internally used enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs as software.\nWe review the recoverability of our long-lived assets annually and when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or\nasset group may not be recoverable. We assess possible impairment based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-\ntax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations, as well as the useful lives applied to the assets. If these cash flows are less than the carrying\nvalue of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value, and the carrying value of the\nrelated assets is reduced by this difference. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets. In\nestimating future cash flows and the fair value of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in legal factors and the business climate, product and technology obsolescence, and\ncompetition. We performed an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and deemed no impairment was necessary for the current or prior year.\nSubsequent to our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment that gave cause for additional impairment testing\nof our long-lived assets. Additionally, we did not recognize any gains or losses on the disposal of equipment in the year ended December 31, 2023 and recognized gains on\ndisposal of equipment of $27 thousand in the year ended January 1, 2023.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. We review the recoverability of our long-lived\nassets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible\nimpairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest\ncharges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair\nvalue and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of these assets. In estimating future cash flows\nand the fair value of its intangible assets, we consider changes in legal factors and the business climate, product and technology obsolescence, and competition. We performed\nan annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and deemed no impairment was necessary for the current or prior year. Subsequent to our annual\nimpairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment that gave cause for additional impairment testing of our intangible assets. No\nimpairment of intangible assets has been recognized to date.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nStatements of Operations:\nRevenue 100% 100% 100%\nCost of revenue 32% 46% 42%\nGross profit 68% 54% 58%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 30% 31% 54%\nSelling, general and administrative 38% 46% 63%\nOperating income (loss) —% (23)% (59)%\nInterest expense (1)% (1)% (1)%\nGain on forgiveness of PPP Loan —% —% 9%\nInterest income and other (expense) income, net (1)% (2)% —%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (2)% (26)% (51)%\nProvision for income taxes —% —% 1%\nNet income (loss) (2)% (26)% (52)%\n27\nTable of Contents\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022\nRevenue. The table below sets forth the changes in revenue for Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023 (in thousands,\nexcept percentage data):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 Year-Over-Year Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nNew products $ 18,211 86% $ 11,675 72% $ 6,536 56%\nMature products 2,987 14% 4,505 28% (1,518) (34)%\nTotal revenue $ 21,198 100% $ 16,180 100% $ 5,018 31%\nNew products revenue consists of revenues from the sale of hardware products manufactured on 180 nanometer or smaller semiconductor processes, eFPGA IP\nlicense, professional services, QuickAI, and SensiML AI software as a service (SaaS) revenues. Mature products include all products produced on semiconductor processes\nlarger than 180 nanometer.\nTotal revenue increased approximately $5 million, or 31% in Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023.\nThe increase in total revenue was comprised of an increase of $6.5 million in new product revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in mature product revenue.\nNew Products Revenue. The table below sets forth the changes in new products revenue for Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Fiscal Year ended\nJanuary 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 Year-Over-Year Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nHardware products $ 1,230 6% $ 3,757 23% $ (2,527) (67)%\neFPGA IP 16,839 79% 7,545 47% 9,294 123%\nSaaS & Other 142 1% 373 2% (231) (62)%\nTotal new products revenue $ 18,211 86% $ 11,675 72% $ 6,536 56%\nThe increase in new product revenue was primarily driven by an increase in eFPGA IP revenue, partially offset by a decrease in new hardware product revenue and\nSaaS & Other revenue. eFPGA IP revenue is comprised primarily of eFPGA intellectual property revenue, eFPGA-related professional services revenue, and eFPGA-related\nsupport and maintenance revenue. eFPGA IP revenue increased approximately $9.3 million, or 123%, as compared to the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023. The increase in\neFPGA IP revenue was primarily comprised of a $9.2 million increase in eFPGA-related professional services revenue. SaaS & Other revenue decreased approximately $0.2\nmillion, or (62)% as compared to the Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023. The decrease in SaaS & Other revenue was driven by a $0.1 million decrease each in both software-\nrelated professional services revenue and SaaS-related revenue. New hardware revenue decreased by approximately $2.5 million, or (67)%, in the Fiscal Year ended December\n31, 2023 compared to the Fiscal Year endedJanuary 1, 2023. The decrease in new hardware product revenue was primarily comprised of a reduction of $1.0 million in display\nproduct revenue, $0.9 million in connectivity product revenue, and $0.7 million in sensor product revenue.\nContract liabilities (deferred revenue) associated with eFPGA-related professional services revenue was $1.0 million and $0.2 million and were included in deferred\nrevenue on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. Contract assets associated with eFPGA-related professional services\nrevenue was $3.6 million and $2.0 million on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively.\nGross Profit. The table below sets forth the changes in gross profit for Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023 (in\nthousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 Year-Over-Year Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nRevenue $ 21,198 100% $ 16,180 100% $ 5,018 31%\nCost of revenue 6,711 32% 7,378 46% (667) (9)%\nGross profit $ 14,487 68% $ 8,802 54% $ 5,685 65%\nGross profit in Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022 increased approximately $5.7 million, or 65%. The change in gross profit reflects an increase in\nrevenue of $5.0 million, or 31%, accompanied by a decrease in cost of revenue of $0.7 million, or (9)%. The increase in revenue was driven by a $6.5 million increase in new\nproduct revenue, primarily growth in eFPGA IP professional services revenue, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in mature product revenue. The $0.7 million decrease\nin cost of revenue was comprised of a decrease in product costs resulting from lower devices volumes and a decrease in R&D expense allocations to cost of revenues, partially\noffset by an increase in inventory reserves and contract manufacturer (\"CM\") costs.\nIn Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, we capitalized costs associated with internal-use software of approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. For Fiscal\nYears 2023 and 2022, we recognized $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively in amortization expense of internal-use software in cost of revenues on our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOur hardware products have historically had a long product life cycle and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. However, as\nwe pursue opportunities in the IoT market and continue to develop new products, we believe our product life cycle may be shorter, which will increase the potential for\nobsolescence. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers. The sale of inventories previously written-off\nwas approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We wrote down approximately $0.6 million and $0.2 million to inventory\nreserves in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022.\nOperating Expenses. The table below sets forth the changes in operating expenses for Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to Fiscal Year ended January\n1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 Year-Over-Year Change\n% of Total % of Total\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percentage\nResearch and development $ 6,448 30% $ 5,001 31% $ 1,447 29%\nSelling, general and administrative 7,969 38% 7,601 47% 368 5%\nTotal operating expenses $ 14,417 68% $ 12,602 78% $ 1,815 14%\nResearch and Development Expenses. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel, overhead and other costs associated with System on\nChip (\"SoC\") and software development, programmable logic design, AI and eFPGA development. R&D expenses were $6.4 million and $5 million in Fiscal Years 2023 and\n2022, respectively, which represented 30% and 31%, respectively, of revenue for those periods. The $1.4 million increase in R&D expenses in Fiscal Year 2023 as compared to\nFiscal Year 2022 was primarily attributable to increases in employee salary, software maintenance, and financing arrangement expenses and reductions in the allocation of R&D\nexpenses to cost of revenues, partially offset by a decrease in consulting costs, stock-based compensation, and outside services. R&D costs allocable to cost of revenues are\nincluded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs\nfor sales, marketing, finance, administration, human resources and general management. SG&A expenses were $8.0 million and $7.6 million in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, which represented 38% and 47%, respectively, of revenue for those periods. The $0.4 million increase in SG&A expenses in Fiscal Year 2023 as compared to\nFiscal Year 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and stock-based compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in insurance and accounting and audit\nexpenses.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income and Other (Expense) Income, net. The table below sets forth the changes in interest expense and interest income and other\n(expense) income, net, for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to Fiscal Year ended January 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years Year-Over-Year Change\n2023 2022 Amount Percentage\nInterest expense $ (215) $ (148) $ 67 (45)%\nInterest income and other (expense) income, net $ (116) $ (221) (105) 48%\nTotal interest expense and interest income and other (expense) income, net $ (331) $ (369) $ (38) 10%\nInterest expense relates primarily to our line of credit facility. Interest income and other (expenses) income, net, relates to the interest earned on our money market\naccounts and foreign exchange gain or losses recorded.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The table below sets forth the changes in provision for income taxes in the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the Fiscal\nYear ended January 1, 2023 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Years Year-Over-Year Change\n2023 2022 Amount Percentage\nProvision for income taxes $ 2 $ 98 $ (96) (98)%\nIncome tax expense for the Fiscal Year 2023 and 2022 relates primarily to foreign income tax provision for our India entity.\nAs of the end of Fiscal Year 2023, our ability to utilize our U.S. deferred tax assets in future periods is uncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation\nallowance against the related U.S. deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets in future periods.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for Fiscal Year 2022 compared to Fiscal Year 2021, please refer to “Part II, Item\n7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K, which was originally filed with the SEC on\nMarch 28, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operating losses and capital investments through the sale of our common stock, financing arrangements, operating leases, and cash\nflows provided by operations. We also have the ability to draw advances from our revolving facility with Heritage Bank of Commerce (\"Heritage Bank\"). As of December 31,\n2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $24.6 million, inclusive of $20 million in advances from our revolving facility.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, re-payments of advances from our revolving facility, and payments under financing\narrangements and operating leases. Purchase obligations include amounts that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as amounts that are not recorded on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Purchase obligations that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers\nand to subcontractors. Our risk associated with these purchase obligations is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts and as such, we do not believe\nthey represent a material liquidity risk to us. Purchase obligations not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets represent significant future obligations associated with\nongoing eFPGA IP revenue contracts. These obligations are dependent on numerous variables and therefore, it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of payments which\ncould differ materially from our estimates.\nCredit Agreement\nOn December 21, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank (as amended, the \"Loan Agreement\") which\namong other things, provided a revolving facility (\"Revolving Facility\") allowing us to draw advances up to $15.0 million. The Revolving Facility includes a number of\ncustomary and restrictive financial covenants including maintaining certain minimum cash levels with the lender. On December 8, 2023, we entered into the Seventh\nAmendment to the Loan Agreement, which increased the line of credit to $20.0 million, extended the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and\nincreased the annual facility fee to $60 thousand from $45 thousand, payable each December 31st. Advances under the Revolving Facility bear a variable annual interest rate\nequal to one-half of one percent (0.50%) above the prime rate. On December 31, 2023, we had a $20.0 million outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility with an interest\nrate of 9.00%. On January 1, 2023, we had a $15.0 million outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 8.00%. We were in compliance with all loan\ncovenants under the Loan Agreement, as of the end of the current reporting period.\nHeritage Bank has a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the company’s tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the\nLoan Agreement. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommon Stock Offerings\nOn March 13, 2024, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and their affiliated entities for the sale of an aggregate of\n223 thousand shares of common stock in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of\napproximately $3.5 million. Issuance costs related to the offering were immaterial.\nOn March 21, 2023, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 450 thousand shares of our common\nstock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $2.3 million. Issuance\ncosts related to the offering were immaterial.\nOn September 14, 2022 and February 9, 2022, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 487\nthousand and 310 thousand shares of common stock, respectively, in registered direct offerings pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net\ncash proceeds of approximately $3.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Issuance costs related to the September 14, 2022 and the February 9, 2022 offerings were\nimmaterial.\nOn August 17, 2022, we filed a new Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to replace a previously expired Registration on Form S-3, under which we\nmay sell, from time-to-time common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities, and units, individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other\nsecurities or a combination thereof. Our registration statement became effective on August 26, 2022.\nOn September 22, 2021, we entered into a share subscription agreement for the sale of 125 thousand shares of our common stock. On September 30, 2021, we\nentered into a common stock purchase agreement for the sale of 74 thousand shares of our common stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf\nregistration statement on Form S-3. The net proceeds to the company in aggregate, after deducting equity issuance costs of approximately $45 thousand was approximately $1.0\nmillion.\nAt January 2, 2023, warrants exercisable for 386 thousand shares of common stock at an exercise price of $19.32 per share remained outstanding. These warrants\nwere issued on May 29, 2018 and were exercisable any time for a period of 60 months. The warrants expired unexercised on May 29, 2023.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nOn May 6, 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with Heritage Bank for a loan of $1.2 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP Loan\") under\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act enacted on March 27, 2020 (\"CARES Act\"). On June 5, 2020, the President of the United States signed into law the\nPaycheck Protection Flexibility Act (“PPPFA”) to address many concerns expressed by the small business community. As of September 27, 2020, we fully utilized the loan\nproceeds in compliance with PPPFA guidelines. We applied for the full loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter of 2020 and on January 26, 2021 we received a notice from\nHeritage Bank that principal and interest amounts under the PPP Loan had been forgiven. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2023, most of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in a Heritage Bank money market account. As of December 31, 2023, our interest-\nbearing debt consisted of $1.4 million outstanding under finance arrangements and $20 million outstanding under our Revolving Facility. See Note 7 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements for additional information.\nCash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively.\nEarnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources and\nwe continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors which affect our liquidity,\ncapital resources, and global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for\noperations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and capital market conditions.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 4,847 $ (4,056) $ (2,864)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (6,339) (814) (713)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 6,897 4,466 434\nNet Cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities\nIn Fiscal Year 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 million, which was primarily due to non-cash charges of $5.3 million. Non-cash charges\nprimarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and certain definite-lived intangible assets of $2.2\nmillion, and write-down of inventories of $0.6 million. Non-cash charges were partially offset by a net loss of $0.1 million and changes in working capital of $0.3 million.\nChanges in working capital consisted of an increase in contract assets of $1.6 million, an increase in other assets of $1.2 million, and a decrease in lease liabilities of $0.4\nmillion, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.0 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.0 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $0.8\nmillion. Historically, our operating cash flows represented cash used in operating activities.\nIn Fiscal Year 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $4.1 million, which was primarily due to a net loss of $4.3 million and changes in working capital of\n$3.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $3.7 million. Changes in working capital consisted of an increase in accounts receivable of $1.7 million, an increase in\ncontract assets of $1.7 million, an increase in inventories of $0.6 million, a decrease in lease liabilities of $0.4 million, an increase in other assets of $0.3 million, and a decrease\nin deferred revenue of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in trade payables of $1.5 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense\nof $2.0 million, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and certain definite-lived intangible assets of $1.5 million, and write-down of inventories of $0.2 million.\nNet Cash provided by (used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in Fiscal Year 2023 was approximately $6.3 million, which was primarily attributable to capital expenditures related to property\nand equipment of $5.6 million and the capitalization of internal-use software in the amount of $1.0 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation capitalized to internal-\nuse software in the amount of $0.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities in Fiscal Year 2022 was approximately $0.8 million, which was primarily attributable to capital expenditures primarily related to\nproperty and equipment of $0.1 million and the capitalization of internal-use software in the amount of $0.7 million.\nNet Cash provided by (used in) Financing Activities\nIn Fiscal Year 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.9 million, primarily attributable to an increase in our revolving credit facility in the amount\nof $5 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the amount of $2.5 million, partially offset by $0.7 million in payments related to financing arrangements.\nIn Fiscal Year 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.5 million, primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the amount\nof $4.9 million, partially offset by $0.5 million in payments related to finance arrangements.\nWe require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from\nthe revolving facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Our revolving facility will expire on December 31, 2025.\nFurther, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit and may require our immediate repayment of the\noutstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market\nacceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity,\nnew product development efforts, capital expenditures, and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer-term liquidity requirements, we may be required to\nraise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.\n31\nTable of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following discussion describes the material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and other obligations, and the effect such obligations are\nexpected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods. The following summarizes our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023:\nPayments Due by Period\nMore than 5\nTotal Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years Years\nOperating lease obligations $ 1,133 $ 378 $ 691 $ 64 $ —\nFinancing arrangements 1,407 946 461 — —\nRevolving Facility (1) 20,000 20,000 — — —\nPurchase obligations:\nWafer purchases (2) — — — — —\nOther purchase commitments 6,618 6,618 — — —\nLiability of an estimated amount (3) 4,461 4,461 — — —\nTotal material cash requirements $ 33,619 $ 32,403 $ 1,152 $ 64 $ —\n(1) The current maturity date on our Revolving Facility is December 31, 2025. However, we include this amount in the less than 1 year category due to the revolving nature\nof the balance and our expected use of the line of credit. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(2) Certain wafer manufacturers require us to forecast wafer starts several months in advance. We are committed to take delivery of and pay for a portion of forecasted wafer\nvolume.\n(3) Contingent obligations are estimated significant future obligations on eFPGA IP procurement contracts. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for\nadditional information.\nConcentration of Suppliers\nWe depend on a limited number of contract manufacturers, subcontractors, and suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, programming, and testing of our hardware\nproducts and for the supply of programming equipment. These services are typically provided by one supplier for each of our hardware products. We generally purchase these\nsingle or limited source services through standard purchase orders. Since we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services, we cannot directly control product\ndelivery schedules, costs, or quality levels. Our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors. These subcontract manufacturers\nproduce products for other companies and we must place orders in advance of expected delivery. As a result, we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand\nfor our products, which could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventories of a particular product, and our ability to respond to changes in demand is limited by these\nsuppliers’ ability to provide products with the quantity, quality, cost, and timeliness that we require. The decision not to provide these services to us or the inability to supply\nthese services to us, such as in the case of a natural or financial disaster, would have a significant impact on our business. Increased demand from other companies could result\nin these subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to customers that are larger or have long-term supply contracts in place and we may be unable to obtain\nadequate foundry and other capacity at acceptable prices, or we may experience delays or interruption in supply. Additionally, volatility of economic, market, social, and\npolitical conditions in countries where these suppliers operate may be unpredictable and could result in a reduction in product revenue or increase our cost of revenue and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain any off-balance arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and\nestimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nChanges from Prior Periodic Reports\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have revised our disclosures to comply with SEC Release No. 33-10890 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected\nFinancial Data, Supplementary Financial Information” which became fully effective on August 9, 2021. This release was adopted to simplify and enhance certain financial\ndisclosure requirements in Regulation S-K.\nSpecifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting\ncomprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Moss Adams LLP, San Francisco, CA, PCAOB ID: 659) 34\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 36\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021 37\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021 38\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the Fiscal Years 2023, 2022, and 2021 39\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 40\n33\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nQuickLogic Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of QuickLogic Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and\nschedules (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates.\nWrite-downs of Excess and Obsolete Inventories\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s inventories balance was $2.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company values its\ninventories at lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard cost approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company writes down inventory that has\nbecome obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory in excess of expected requirements.\nThe estimate of excess and obsolete inventories is subjective and primarily dependent on the estimates of future demand for a particular product. Changes in assumptions of\nproduct demand could have a significant impact on the amount of write-down recorded. The determination of write-down of inventories requires management to make\nsignificant assumptions and subjective judgments about the future salability of the inventory and the value of obsolete and unmarketable inventory. These assumptions include\nthe assessment of market conditions and trends, sales forecasts, historic usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, the stage in the product life cycle of its customers’\nproducts, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer design activity, customer\nconcentrations, product merchantability and other factors.\nWe identified the write-down of inventories, in particular the estimates for excess and obsolete inventories, as a critical audit matter, because of the significant assumptions and\nsubjective judgments used by management, which involved significant audit effort and the use of especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment when performing audit\nprocedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating the appropriateness of management’s process for developing the estimates for excess and obsolete inventories by:\n• Evaluating the methodology utilized to calculate the estimate.\n• Performing inquiries with management as to the composition of the reserve for aged inventory items without recent sales.\n• Assessing the appropriateness of the formulaic calculation and management adjustments by product type.\n• Evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management including those related to future demand by:\n• Evaluating management’s ability to provide reasonable forecast of sales by comparing management’s prior period sales forecasts to actual results.\n• Performing inquiries with non-financial personnel, including sales and production employees, regarding obsolete or discontinued inventory items and other\nfactors to corroborate management’s assertions regarding qualitative judgments about excess and obsolete inventories.\n• Testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the underlying data used in management’s estimate.\n• Testing the calculations related to the application of the methodology to specific inventory categories by agreement to supporting documentation and recalculation.\nRevenue Recognition of Professional Services Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s eFPGA-related professional services revenue was approximately $16.6 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s professional services revenue is generally recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to and accepted\nby the customer. However, at times, revenue is recognized over time when there is no alternative use for the contract asset and there is an enforceable right to payment for\nperformance completed to date.\nWe have identified the timing of when control is transferred to the customer as a critical audit matter. Auditing this element of revenue recognition involved especially\nchallenging auditor judgment in the determination of distinct performance obligations and an increased extent of auditor effort due to; (i) the existence of and variability in the\ntermination for convenience clause within the contract including the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and (ii) consideration of the alternative use\nof the asset.\n• Evaluating management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.\n• Evaluating the appropriateness of management's evaluation of various terms and conditions in revenue contracts by:\n• Obtaining and reading contract source documents, including master agreements, and other related documents.\n• Assessing the terms of the contracts and evaluating the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of\nestimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.\n• Testing management's identification and treatment of contract terms, including evaluating termination for convenience clauses and enforceable right to payment\nfor performance completed to date, and assessing the evidence of alternative use for the contract asset.\n• Evaluating when the customer obtained control of each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognized either over time or at a point in time.\n• Assessing the appropriateness of the timing of revenue recognition for a sample of revenue contracts through:\n• Testing the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 26,

The Company provides innovative, programmable silicon and software\nplatforms to enable its customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, QuickLogic is a fabless semiconductor\ncompany with a variety of products: embedded FPGA (\"eFPGA\") intellectual property (\"IP\"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips (\"SoCs\"), discrete FPGAs,\nand AI software. QuickLogic's customers can use its eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products,\nthe Company's SoCs to run its customers' software and build their hardware around, and the Company's discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics\nToolkit from SensiML Corporation (\"SensiML\"), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with\naccurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of platforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor\nprocessing across Aerospace, and Defense, Consumer/Industrial IoT, and Consumer Electronics markets.\nQuickLogic’s Fiscal Year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Fiscal Years2023, 2022, and 2021 ended on December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and\nJanuary 2, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company has one reportable business segment based on how its Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) manages the business and in a manner consistent\nwith the internal reporting provided to the CODM. The CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), reviews detailed income statements, balance sheets, and sales\nreports in order to assess performance of the Company. Sales and operating income are some of the key variables monitored by the CODM and management when determining\nthe Company's financial condition and operating performance.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has financed its operations and capital investments through the sale of common stock, financing arrangements, operating leases, a revolving line of\ncredit, and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million,\ninclusive of a $20 million advance from its Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank of Commerce (\"Heritage Bank\").\nThe Company's principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, re-payments of draw-downs from the revolving line of credit, and payments under\noperating and finance arrangements. Purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers. The Company's risk associated with the\npurchase obligations is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts and as such, the Company does not believe they represent a material liquidity risk.\nSee Note 7 for additional information.\nHeritage Bank has a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under a loan\nagreement. See Note 7 for additional information.\nOn March 21, 2023, the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 450 thousand shares of its\ncommon stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $2.3 million.\nIssuance costs related to the offering were immaterial.\nOn September 14, 2022 and February 9, 2022, the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate\nof 487 thousand and 310 thousand shares of common stock, respectively, in registered direct offering direct offerings pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on\nForm S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $3.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Issuance costs related to the September 14, 2022 and the February 9,\n2022 offerings were immaterial.\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company entered into a share subscription agreement for the sale of 125 thousand of its common stock. On September 30, 2021, the\nCompany entered into a common stock purchase agreement for the sale of 74 thousand shares of its common stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf\nregistration statement on Form S- 3. The net proceeds to the Company in aggregate, after deducting equity issuance costs of approximately $45 thousand was approximately\n$1.0 million. See Note 11 for additional information.\nThe Company currently uses its cash to fund its working capital, to accelerate the development of next-generation products and for general corporate purposes.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with $2.3 million gross cash proceeds from the\nMarch 21, 2023 financing, its revenues from operations, and the available financial resources from the Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank will be sufficient to fund its\noperations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months.\n40\nTable of Contents\nVarious factors affect the Company’s liquidity, including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor\nindustry; the conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on the Company's ArcticLink® and\nPolarPro® platforms, ArcticPro™, EOS S3 SoC, Quick AI solution, QuickAI™, SensiML Analytics Toolkit, Eclipse II products, and eFPGA IP license and professional\nservices; fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a result of the stage in the product life cycle of its customers’ products; costs of\nsecuring access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories; wafer purchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of\nresearch and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production volumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of its\ninvestment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or renew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit\nfacilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the Company; the issuance and exercise of stock options and participation in the Company’s employee stock\npurchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics.\nOver the longer term, the Company anticipates that sales generated from its new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial\nresources from its Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank, assuming renewal of the Revolving Facility or the Company entering into a new debt agreement with an alternative\nlender prior to the expiration of the revolving line of credit on December 31, 2025, and its ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be sufficient to\nsatisfy its operations and capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such\ncapital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The inability of the Company to generate sufficient sales from its new product offerings and/or raise additional\ncapital if needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition, including its ability to maintain compliance with its lender’s\nfinancial covenants.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in the United States of America or (\"US\nGAAP\"), and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, (\"SEC\"), and include the accounts of QuickLogic and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting periods.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in its\nconsolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and\nresults of operations and requires it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAlthough these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately\nmaterially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, inventory\nvaluation, including the identification of excess quantities, market value, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. The Company\nbelieves that it applies judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\nthat fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the Company's financial\nstatements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 and related Accounting Standards Updates (\"ASUs\").\nThe Company earns revenue from principal activities by (i) delivering standard hardware products, (ii) delivering and providing eFPGA IP products and professional\nservices, (iii) and providing software as a service to customers, as well as (iv) other miscellaneous revenue.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the Company applies a five-step model for recognizing revenue\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer,\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract,\n3. Determination of the transaction price. The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the performance\nobligations in the contract, which may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. The Company's contracts with customers containing variable\nconsideration are generally sales-based royalties, which is fully constrained.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nWhen entering into a new contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay, or credit risk.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a description of the Company's revenue recognition policy by principal activity:\nHardware Product Revenue\nThe Company generates revenue by supplying standard hardware products, which must be programmed before they can be used in an application. Standard\nhardware products may be programmed by the Company, distributors, end customers, or third parties. Contracts with customers for hardware products generally do not include\nother performance obligations such as services, extended warranties, or other material rights. The Company's promise to transfer hardware products is identified as a distinct\nperformance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue on hardware products when it transfers control of the promised products to the customer. Transfer of control of\nhardware products occurs when its performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs upon shipment from the Company's manufacturing site or headquarters. The\nCompany recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products, which also represents the standalone selling price\n(SSP) of its performance obligation. Hardware product prices are fixed. The Company elected a practical expedient in which it does not assess whether a contract has a\nsignificant financing component since its standard payment terms are less than one year. The Company allocates the transaction price of customer contracts to each distinct\nproduct based on its relative SSP. The sale of hardware products does not typically involve significant judgment or estimates by management. However, the Company does\nrecord an allowance for hardware product sales returns, which requires some judgment by management.\nHardware Product Sales Return Allowance\nWhile the terms and conditions of the sale of hardware products generally do not allow for refunds or product returns other than for warranty repairs, the Company\ndoes record an allowance for hardware product sales returns. The allowance for sales returns is based on a historical returns analysis of the prior four quarters that is performed\non a quarterly basis. Amounts recorded for hardware product sales returns were $8 thousand, $2 thousand and a sales return reversal of $13 thousand for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. While hardware product sales returns have\nnot been material to the Company in recent reporting periods, the Company notes there is an inherent uncertainty in estimating this allowance. In the case where actual results\nmay significantly vary from management estimates, the Company may be required to make future adjustments to its revenues and operating results.\neFPGA IP Revenue\neFPGA IP revenue is comprised of eFPGA intellectual property revenue, eFPGA-related professional services revenue, and eFPGA-related support and maintenance\nrevenue. The Company recognizes eFPGA intellectual property revenue from licensing its eFPGA intellectual property to customers and recognizes eFPGA-related professional\nservices revenue from the fees associated with the custom development and integration of the Company's technology solutions into hardware products. The Company\nrecognizes eFPGA revenue from support and maintenance services for post-implementation customer support ratably over the service term. Renewals of support and\nmaintenance contracts create new performance obligations for which the Company recognizes as revenue ratably over the service term. The majority of the Company's revenue\nis derived from sales of eFPGA IP licenses and professional services.\neFPGA IP contractual arrangements often include promises to transfer intellectual property licenses, to customize hardware products, and to provide professional\nservices and technical support services. The Company must determine whether the promised goods and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately or are a single, combined performance obligation and should be accounted for together. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company must evaluate whether the\ncustomer can benefit from each good or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and whether the transfer of each good or\nservice can be separately identifiable. The Company also must evaluate when control of the performance obligation is transferred to and accepted by the customer. The\nCompany notes these determinations, in addition to identifying contractual terms and conditions within the contract including termination for convenience clauses, enforceable\nrights to payment for performance completed-to-date, and consideration of the alternative use of the asset require significant judgment. In these judgments, the Company\nconsiders the context of the contract, historical experience with similar contracts, and the interdependency of the promised goods and services.\nAdditionally, judgment is required by management to allocation the transaction price to the separately identifiable performance obligations in the contract. The\nCompany allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. The Company rarely sells eFPGA intellectual property licenses\non a standalone basis. Generally, the Company will provide eFPGA-related professional services and support and maintenance services to customers in conjunction with\neFPGA IP licenses based on unique contractual arrangement terms and conditions. As such, the Company is required to estimate the SSP for each performance obligation.\nIn instances where the SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the promised goods or services separately, the Company typically\ndetermines the SSP using either the adjusted market assessment approach or the expected cost plus a margin approach, depending on the characteristics and context of the\ndeliverable. The selected method is applied by the Company consistently for similar arrangements and deliverables. The factors used to select the most appropriate estimation\nmethod, as well as select the most appropriate SSP include, but are not limited to, the extent of internal costs required to provide the promised performance obligation, margins\nachieved on standalone sales of similar products, profit objectives, cost structure, location-specific factors, and competition.\nIn other instances, the Company may have more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers\nand circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as its overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors,\nincluding the value of its contracts, customer type, customer tier, type of the technology used, customer demographics, and geographic locations, among other factors. The\nCompany also provides eFPGA-related professional services on a time-and-material basis.\nGenerally, the Company satisfies eFPGA-related contractual performance obligations over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits\nprovided by the Company’s performance as it performs, the Company's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as it is created or enhanced, or the\nCompany’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to\ndate. When the Company satisfies performance obligations over time, it recognizes revenue by applying an over-time methodology that faithfully depicts the Company’s\nperformance toward satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nThe Company’s over-time methodologies include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Revenue recognition model measured using an input method such as units of labor,\n• Revenue recognition model measured using an output method reflecting a generally consistent effort to satisfy performance obligations throughout the contractual\narrangement term,\n• Revenue recognition model measured using an output method such as the specific deliverables produced,\n• Revenue recognition model measured using an input method such as time and material for professional engineering services. For revenue derived from time and\nmaterial inputs, the Company estimates a fully-burdened overhead rate for the labor and any materials required.\n42\nTable of Contents\nDue to the nature of the work performed under contractual arrangements, the selection and application of an over-time methodology is complex and involves\nsignificant judgment. In the case of the selection of an input method, the key factors reviewed by management to estimate costs to complete each contract include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated labor days-effort necessary to complete the project, budgeted hours, hourly cost to the Company, profit margins, and engineering hours at cut-off when\nprojects extend beyond a reporting period. In the case of the selection of an output method, key factors reviewed by management include, but are not limited to, the specific\ndeliverables specified in the contracts with customers and the duration of performance, inclusive of delays. The Company has methods and controls in place for tracking labor-\ndays incurred in completing eFPGA IP contracts, as well as quantifying changes in estimates used within the chosen methodology. Management considers labor-days to be a\ncritical estimate as any significant variation of labor and time required to complete a contractual arrangement could cause a revenue claw-back from prior periods and deferral\nof revenue to future periods.\nWhen the expected consideration from a revenue contract with a customer is less than the expected costs of fulfilling the contract, the Company is required to first\nimpair any capitalized costs associated with the contract. The Company is also required to recognize a provision for contract losses as a liability on its balance sheet. This would\nresult in an unfavorable impact to income from operations.\nSaaS & Other Revenue\nSaaS & Other Revenue is comprised primarily of software as a service (\"SaaS\") revenue and software-related professional services revenue. SaaS revenue is\ngenerated when the Company licenses its software to customers and allows customers to access the software over a short-term subscription basis. The Company grants the\ncustomer the right to access and use software at the outset of the arrangement and throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The Company recognizes SaaS revenue ratably\nover the license term. The Company recognizes revenue from software-related professional services as services are provided to the customer.\nOther miscellaneous revenue is comprised primarily of royalties from licensing the Company’s technology. The Company recognizes royalty revenue on the later of\n(i) the subsequent sale or usage, or (ii) satisfaction of a performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based royalty has been allocated.\nPractical Expedients, Elections, and Exemptions\n• Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities and that are related to the sales of the Company's products are excluded from revenues.\n• Sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general,\nand administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n• The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with original expected lengths of one year or less or (ii) contracts\nfor which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for the services performed.\nValuation of Inventories\nHardware product inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard cost approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The\nCompany routinely evaluates quantities and values of its inventories in light of current market conditions and trends and records reserves for quantities in excess of demand and\nfor product obsolescence. The evaluation may take into consideration historic usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, the stage in the product life cycle of the\nCompany's customers’ products, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer\ndesign activity, customer concentrations, and product merchantability, among other factors. Actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand and this\ndifference could have a material impact on the Company's gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventories or a benefit\nfrom inventories previously written down. The Company also regularly reviews the cost of inventories against estimated market value and records a lower of cost or market\nreserve for inventories that have a cost in excess of estimated market value, which could have a material impact on its hardware product gross margin and hardware product\ninventory balances based on additional write-downs to net realizable value or a benefit from inventories previously written down. Estimates of market value for the Company's\nproducts require subjective criteria such as anticipated demand and market acceptance for unique products. Differences between these estimates and actual results could result\nin gross margin volatilities from period to period.\nThe Company's hardware products have historically had an unusually long product life cycle and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of\ninventories. However, as the Company continues to develop new products, the Company believes its new product life cycle may be shorter, which could increase the potential\nfor obsolescence. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory on hand. Although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of\nits forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or frequent new product developments could have a significant impact on the value of\nits inventory and its results of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The carrying value of\ngoodwill is not amortized but is annually tested for impairment during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter, and more often if there is an indicator of impairment. The Company\neither performs a qualitative assessment under ASC 350, including the consideration of factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and\noverall financial performance, or a quantitative assessment under ASU No. 2017-14, which involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value.\nSubsequent to the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment that gave cause for additional\nimpairment testing of goodwill. No impairment of goodwill has been recognized to date.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets include property and equipment, software, tooling, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, and internal-use software.\nThese assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally one to ten years, with the amortization period of internal-use software being generally five years and the amortization period of\nleasehold improvements being the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three to five years. The Company notes the estimation\nof the useful lives of its long-lived assets involves judgment and estimation by management. In the determination of an asset’s useful life, the Company considers the following\nfactors: obsolescence, competition, historical product life cycles, and industry and market considerations, among others. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the useful\nlife ranges of the Company’s long-lived assets.\nThe Company recognizes assets for pre-production design and development costs for which there is a contractual reimbursement by the customer. These assets are\nclassified under 'tooling' within property and equipment and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally seven years. Refer to Note 4 for additional\ninformation.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe Company capitalizes costs related to the development and enhancement of hosted services it provides to its customers and the development and enhancement of\nother internally used engineering software as internal-use software. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their useful lives, which are generally five to seven years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed\nas incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to internally used enterprise-level business and finance software in support of the Company’s operational needs as\nsoftware.\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets annually and when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of\nthe asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses possible impairment based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from\nthe expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations, as well as the useful lives applied to the assets. If these cash flows\nare less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value, and the\ncarrying value of the related assets is reduced by this difference. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-\nlived assets. In estimating future cash flows and the fair value of its long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in legal factors and the business climate, product and\ntechnology obsolescence, and competition. The Company performed an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 and deemed no impairment was\nnecessary for the current or prior year. Subsequent to the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment\nthat gave cause for additional impairment testing of the Company’s long-lived assets. Additionally, the Company did not recognize any gains or losses on the disposal of\nequipment in the year ended December 31, 2023 and recognized gains on disposal of equipment of $27 thousand in the year ended January 1, 2023.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The Company reviews the recoverability of its\nlong-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of\npossible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between\nestimated fair value and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of these assets. In estimating\nfuture cash flows and the fair value of its intangible assets, the Company considers changes in legal factors and the business climate, product and technology obsolescence, and\ncompetition. The Company performed an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 and deemed no impairment was necessary for the current or\nprior year. Subsequent to the Company's annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, there were no indicators of impairment that gave cause for additional\nimpairment testing of the Company’s intangible assets. No impairment of intangible assets has been recognized to date.\nNOTE 2 — OTHER RELEVANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with an original or a remaining maturity at purchase of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio included in cash equivalents is generally comprised of investments that meet high credit quality standards. The Company’s investment\nportfolio consists of money market accounts and funds. Restricted cash represents amounts pledged as cash security related to the use of credit cards.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company estimates the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance, current and\nhistorical customer trends, and communications with its customers. Amounts are written off only after considerable collection efforts have been made and the amounts are\ndetermined to be uncollectible.\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on both historical experience and a specific identification basis. As of December 31, 2023 and\nJanuary 1, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $34 thousand and $18 thousand, respectively, in its consolidated balance sheets. Bad debt expense for the years\nended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 was $24 thousand, $16 thousand, and $62 thousand, respectively.\nContract Balances\nDue to the terms in contractual agreements with customers, the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers, and these timing\ndifferences result in accounts receivables, contract assets, or contract liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing if the Company does not have the unconditional right to invoice the customer.\nThe Company records a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing and also when consideration is received in advance of\nsatisfying performance obligations. Balances in contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the Company has an unconditional right to invoice the customer.\nBalances in contract liabilities (deferred revenue) are recognized as revenue once the performance obligations are satisfied, as control of goods and services are transferred to\nthe customer, all revenue recognition criteria have been met, and any constraints have been resolved. Payment terms and conditions vary by term of contracts with the customer.\nThe Company's contracts do not include a significant financing component. The Company's invoicing terms provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of\npurchasing the Company's goods and services and not to facilitate financing arrangements. The timing between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. The\nCompany defers costs until related revenue is recognized.\nThe Company had contract assets associated with eFPGA-related professional services revenue of approximately $3.6 million, $2.0 million, and $0.3 million and\ncontract liabilities (reflected as deferred revenue) associated with eFPGA-related professional services revenue of $1.1 million, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nThe Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.\nThe Company has concluded that none of the costs it has incurred to obtain and fulfill its ASC 606 contracts during the years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023\nmet the capitalization criteria and as such, there are no costs deferred nor recognized as assets on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nThe current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") reserve required under ASU 2016-13 \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments (Topic 326)\" (\"ASU 2016-13\"), reflects the Company's current estimate of potential credit losses related to its financing receivables. As of January 1, 2023, the\nCompany's CECL reserve was $0. Subsequent changes to the CECL reserve are recognized through a provision for or reversal of current expected credit loss reserve on the\nCompany's consolidated statement of operations. ASU 2016-13 specifies the reserve should be based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss\nexperience, market conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts for the duration of each financing receivable. For each financing receivable, the\nCompany performs an annual quantitative assessment of the impact of CECL using a probability-of-default method. This includes estimating the probability that the loan will\ndefault before its maturity (probability of default) and the amount of the loss if the loan defaults (loss given default). These two factors result in an expected loss percentage that\nis applied to the balance of each financing receivable to determine the expected credit loss. The Company adjusts these factors for current conditions, including the financial\ncondition of the borrower, the probability that it will grant the borrower a concession through modification of the loan terms, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nlosses as necessary.\nFinancing Arrangements & Correction of an Immaterial Error\nThe Company previously classified certain licensed tooling software as leased assets and liabilities under ROU assets and financing lease liabilities pursuant to lease\naccounting under ASC 842, Leases. Upon further analysis, the Company determined these amounts are intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with ASC 350,\nIntangibles, Goodwill, and Other and financed through financing arrangements. As a result, the Company corrected immaterial errors to revise its financial statements as of\nJanuary 1, 2023, to present $933 thousand as property and equipment, net instead of a right of use asset, and to present $887 thousand as notes payable instead of finance\nleases. $616 thousand was incorporated into the Company's accumulated amortization for property and equipment balance as of January 1, 2023.\nThe statements of cash flows have been revised to present non-cash investing and financing activities of $650 thousand and $690 thousand for property and\nequipment purchased through financing arrangements during the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively, previously presented as finance lease\nobligations. Cash payments on notes payable during the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were $452 thousand and $378 thousand, respectively, instead of\npresented as payments of finance lease obligations. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.\nThe Company has determined the correction of this error did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements for any of the periods presented.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases under ASC 842 and related ASUs. Under ASC 842, all significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at the lease\ncommencement date. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company determines if an arrangement is\na lease at inception. When an arrangement is a lease, the Company determines if it is an operating lease or a finance lease. Lease liabilities represent the present value of the\nCompany's future lease payments over the expected lease term, which includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those options will be\nexercised. The present value of a lease liability is determined using the Company's incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception. ROU assets represent the\nCompany's right to control the use of the leased asset during the lease and are recognized in an amount equal to the lease liability for leases with an initial term greater than 12\nmonths. An ROU asset may also include lease payments related to initial direct costs and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. The Company does not apply lease\nrecognition requirements to lease arrangements having terms of twelve months or less. Instead, it recognizes payments in the consolidated statement of operations as rental\ncosts on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements which contain lease and non-lease components; non-lease components are generally\naccounted for separately.\nThe Company’s ROU assets were approximately $1 million and $0.5 million and lease liabilities were approximately $1.0 million and $0.5 million on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in\nthe market used to measure fair value:\n• Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.\nWhere applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including\ninterest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\n• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The\ndetermination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities.\nThe Company's financial assets consisting of an investment in non-marketable equity without a readily determinable fair value are measured under a measurement\nelection alternative to the requirement to carry equity interests at fair value. In the Fiscal Year ended January 2, 2022, the Company recognized revenue from a contractual\narrangement with an unaffiliated customer on the sale of eFPGA IP. The eFPGA IP included an eFPGA intellectual property license, know-how, and eFPGA-related\nprofessional services. Consideration in the contractual arrangement was comprised of cash and non-cash consideration. Non-cash consideration consisted of shares of common\nstock in the customer. The customer was, and continues to be, a privately-held company and its common stock is not publicly traded. The Company applied significant\njudgement to estimate the fair value of the shares as a portion of the total contractual consideration. The Company recognized a $0.3 million non-marketable equity investment\non its consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding amount in deferred revenue. This deferred revenue was recognized as revenue during the year ended January 1, 2023.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn determining the fair value of the investment at acquisition of the common stock, the Company applied the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model using a back-solve\ntechnique and applied significant judgment to quantify inputs used in the model, in accordance with the AICPA Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately Held\nCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (2013). The Company has neither significant influence nor control over the investee. Post-acquisition, the Company\naccounts for the non-marketable equity investment under a practical expedient under ASC 321, in which equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are\nmeasured to fair value at “cost minus impairment.” Under the “cost minus impairment” method, when the non-marketable equity investment is determined to be impaired on\nthe basis of a qualitative assessment, the carrying value of the non-marketable equity security is adjusted to fair value and is measured at cost, less any impairment. The\nCompany reviews its non-marketable equity investment for impairment periodically. The carrying value of non-marketable equity securities is classified within Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy. Any losses, should they occur, from impairments of non-marketable equity investments are recorded in the statements of operations within interest income\nand other (expense) income, net. The non-marketable equity investment is classified as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets. There was no impairment\nassessed as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023. See Note 9 for additional information.\nCost of Revenues\nThe Company records costs of revenue associated with hardware product revenues, eFPGA IP revenue, and SaaS revenue. Hardware product costs include the cost\nof materials, contract manufacturing fees, shipping costs, and quality assurance. Hardware product costs also include indirect costs such as warranty, excess and obsolete\ninventory charges, general overhead costs, and depreciation and amortization of certain capitalized software. eFPGA IP and SaaS costs include costs related to services under\ncontractual agreements over the term of their respective agreements. These costs are primarily comprised of employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs to\nperform work on revenue-generating contracts with customers, software tool utilization costs, and contract engineering costs.\nHardware Product Warranty Costs\nThe Company warrants product hardware against defects in material and workmanship under normal use for twelve months from the date of shipment. The\nCompany’s liability is limited to the cost of repair or replacement of the defective part. The Company does not consider activities related to such warranties to be a separate\nperformance obligation under ASC 606. The terms and conditions of sale generally do not allow for refunds or product returns other than for warranty repairs. The Company\ndoes not have significant product warranty-related costs or liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nAll of the Company’s revenue transactions and inputs to its cost of revenue are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company conducts sales and marketing activities in\nvarious countries outside of the United States. The Company's foreign operations' monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange\nrates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical exchange rates. The Company's foreign operations' income and expenses are\ntransacted in local foreign currency and translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency\ntransactions of the Company's foreign operations are recorded as interest income and other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The impact from\nforeign currencies was not significant for each of the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022.\nOperating expenses denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately 8%, 12%, and 14% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31,\n2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively. The Company incurred a majority of such foreign currency expenses in India, the United Kingdom, China, Taiwan,\nand Japan in the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its\nexposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and therefore, is susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses in its results of operations in future reporting\nperiods.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising and promotion expenses are charged to “selling, general, and administrative” expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred.\nAdvertising and promotion expenses were $44 thousand, $40 thousand, and $47 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022,\nrespectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation under its stock plan (the \"Plan\") to eligible employees and non-employee directors and grants stock-based\ncompensation under an employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") for all eligible employees. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of the\namended authoritative guidance and related interpretations, which require the measurement and recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation\nawards. The fair value of stock-based compensation awards is measured at the grant date and re-measured upon modification, as appropriate. The Company uses the Black-\nScholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units,\nand performance-based restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\nUsing the Black-Scholes pricing model requires the Company to develop highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of awards, expected volatility\nof its stock, expected risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend rate over the term of the award. The expected term of awards is based primarily on the Company's historical\nexperience with similar grants. The expected stock price volatility for both stock options and ESPP shares is based on the historic volatility of the Company's stock, using the\ndaily average of the opening and closing prices, and measured using historical data appropriate for the expected term. The risk-free interest rate assumption approximates the\nrisk-free interest rate of a Treasury Constant Maturity bond with a maturity appropriate for the expected term of stock awards under the Plan or the maturity appropriate for the\nterm of the purchase period for the ESPP Plan. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's intent not to issue a dividend under its dividend policy. This fair value\nis expensed over the requisite service period of the award.\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award less expected forfeitures, over the requisite service period,\nwhich is typically the vesting period. Expected forfeitures are an estimate based on the historical pre-vest cancellation experience and is applied to all share-based awards.\nEquity compensation awards that contain a service condition are expensed using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. Performance-based\nawards are expected to vest based on the achievement of a performance goal and are expensed over the estimated vesting period, which is estimated by management. The\nCompany regularly reviews the assumptions used to compute the fair value of its stock-based awards and it revises its assumptions as appropriate. See Notes 11 and 12 for\nadditional information.\n46\nTable of Contents\nInterest Income\nThe Company's interest income is comprised of interest earned on its money market accounts and financing receivables. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad one note receivable related to the conversion of accounts receivable for a customer. Interest is accrued as earned and is reflected as an increase in the balance of the note\nreceivable, as well as recognized as interest income on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. All accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to the\nCompany on the maturity date of the note receivable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the Company's financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates. This process involves estimating the Company's actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different tax and accounting\ntreatment of items, such as deferred revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, the impact of equity awards, depreciation and amortization, and employee-related accruals.\nThese differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included on the Company's balance sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its\ndeferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. To the\nextent the Company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period, it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of\noperations.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate\nthe tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including\nresolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized\nupon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that it anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year.\nInterest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the\naccrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022 is the same\nas the consolidated comprehensive income (loss).\nConcentrations of Credit and Suppliers\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts\nreceivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality institutions. The Company’s accounts receivables are denominated in U.S. dollars and are derived\nprimarily from sales to customers located in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does\nnot require collateral. See Note 14 for information regarding concentrations associated with accounts receivable.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of contract manufacturers, subcontractors, and suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, programming and testing of its\nhardware products and for the supply of programming equipment. These services are typically provided by one supplier for each of the Company’s hardware products. The\nCompany generally purchases these single or limited source services through standard purchase orders. Since the Company relies on independent subcontractors to perform\nthese services, it cannot directly control its product delivery schedules, costs, or quality levels. The Company’s future success also depends on the financial viability of its\nindependent subcontractors.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen the Company acquires a business, it allocates the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities\nassociated with the fair value of contingent consideration, and acquired identifiable intangible assets with finite lives. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The\nallocation of the purchase price requires the Company to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, intangible\nassets with finite useful lives, and goodwill. These estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, the Company's assessment of this\ninformation, and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash\nflows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be\nderived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be\nallocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that the Company has made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. In addition,\nunanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, the Company may be required to adjust\nthe value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities and may impact the useful life assigned to intangible assets with finite useful lives, which would impact\namortization expense of intangible assets with finite useful lives and results of operations.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognizes assets acquired (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives) and liabilities assumed at fair value on the\nacquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of such assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized in earnings, after the expiration of the measurement period,\na period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related expenses and acquisition-related restructuring costs are recognized in earnings in the period in\nwhich they are incurred.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures by providing information to better assess how an entity's operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational\nopportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows.

For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions to clarify the measurement of the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and requires\ndisclosures related to these types of equity securities. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available\nfor issuance. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts\nin Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which address issues identified as a result of the\ncomplexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The amendments in\nthis Update are effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller\nreporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the\namendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier\nthan Fiscal Years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those Fiscal Years. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-06 is not expected to have an impact\non the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nNOTE 3 — NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share was computed by dividing net income (loss) available by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net income (loss) per share was computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive\ncommon shares outstanding during the period under the treasury stock method. In computing diluted net income (loss) per share, the weighted average stock price for the period\nis used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and warrants. For periods in which the Company has reported a net\nloss, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as dilutive common shares are\nnot assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company has reported a net income, diluted net income per share attributable to\ncommon stockholders is different from basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders as dilutive common shares would increase the amount of shares\noutstanding reduced by the amounts of treasury shares repurchased from the proceeds at the average market price for the period.\nApproximately 0.7 million, 0.8 million, and 0.7 million shares associated with equity awards outstanding and the estimated number of shares to be purchased under\nthe current offering period of the ESPP Plan were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as they were considered antidilutive due to the net loss the\nCompany experienced in the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. Warrants to purchase up to 0.4 million shares were issued in\nconnection with the May 29, 2018 stock offering were also not included in the diluted loss per share calculation as they were also considered anti-dilutive due to the net loss\nthe Company experienced in the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022. These warrants expired unexercised on May 29, 2023.\n48\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 — BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS\nDecember 31, January 1,\n2023 2023\n(in thousands)\nInventories:\nWork-in-process $ 1,602 $ 1,826\nFinished goods 427 667\n$ 2,029 $ 2,493\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nPrepaid taxes $ 498 $ 510\nDeferred charges 290 295\nOther prepaid taxes, royalties, and other prepaid expenses 629 500\nOther 144 265\n$ 1,561 $ 1,570\nProperty and equipment:\nEquipment $ 10,503 $ 10,133\nTooling 9,248 1,549\nSoftware 1,803 1,803\nFurniture and fixtures 65 65\nLeasehold improvements 580 466\n22,199 14,016\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (13,251) (12,618)\n$ 8,948 $ 1,398\nCapitalized internal-use software:\nCapitalized software held for internal use $ 3,491 $ 2,370\nAccumulated amortization (1,422) (856)\n$ 2,069 $ 1,514\nAccrued liabilities:\nAccrued compensation $ 1,910 $ 865\nAccrued employee benefits 57 40\nAccrued payroll tax 197 57\nOther 509 547\n$ 2,673 $ 1,509\nThe Company capitalized $7.09 million in pre-production design and development costs as tooling to be utilized under its long-term professional services contracts\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

The Revolving Facility, as amended, includes a number of customary and restrictive financial covenants including\nmaintaining certain minimum cash levels with the lender. On December 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Loan Agreement, which increased\nthe line of credit to $20.0 million, extended the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and increased the annual facility fee to $60 thousand from $45\nthousand, payable each December 31st. Advances under the Revolving Facility bear a variable annual interest rate equal to one half of one percentage point (0.50%) above the\nprime rate. On December 31, 2023, the Company had a $20.0 million outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 9.00%. On January 1, 2023, the\nCompany had a $15.0 million outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 8.00%.\nThe Company was in compliance with all loan covenants under the Loan Agreement, as of the end of the current reporting period.\nHeritage Bank has a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the\nLoan Agreement.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Heritage Bank (“PPP Loan”) for a loan of $1.2 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection\nProgram under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") as implemented by the U.S. Small Business Administration and enacted on March\n27, 2020.\nThe PPP Loan was evidenced by a promissory note (“Note”) dated May 6, 2020, maturing two years from the disbursement date. The Note bore interest at a rate of\n1.00% per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. Principal and interest were payable monthly commencing six months after the disbursement date. Principal and\ninterest were allowed to be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Note contained customary events of default relating to,\namong other things, payment defaults or breaches of the terms of the Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender may require immediate repayment of all\namounts outstanding under the Note. The Company applied for loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in accordance with the terms under the CARES Act. On\nJanuary 26, 2021, the Company received a notice from Heritage Bank that amounts under the PPP Loan had been forgiven. The Company recorded the loan forgiveness under\ngain on forgiveness of PPP Loan on its consolidated statement of operations in the year ended January 2, 2022.\n50\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe Company previously classified certain licensed tooling software as leased assets and liabilities under ROU assets and financing lease liabilities. Upon further\nanalysis, the Company determined it is more appropriate to classify these amounts as financing arrangements. The amount of fixed assets, net purchased through financing\narrangements on the balance sheet were $1.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The corresponding note payable amount for\nthese financing arrangements was $1.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. Payments related to financing arrangements were\n$0.7 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively. The Company's outstanding financing\narrangements as of December 31, 2023 have remaining terms of 0.91 years to 2.25 years, with a weighted average remaining term of 1.81 years. Stated interest rates for its\nfinancing arrangements outstanding as of December 31, 2023 range from 3.75% to 9.89%, with a weighted average interest rate of 8.34%. The Company's outstanding\nfinancing arrangements as of January 1, 2023 had remaining terms of 1.67 years to 2.01 years, with a weighted average remaining term of 1.91 years. Stated interest rates for its\nfinancing arrangements outstanding as of January 1, 2023 ranged from 3.75% to 6.75%, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.95%.\nAmounts due to be paid in Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 are $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, less amounts representing interest of $0.1 million results in\nthe total notes payable amount of $1.4 million.\nNOTE 8 — LEASES\nThe Company's principal research and development and corporate facilities are leased office buildings located in the United States. These lease facilities are\nclassified as operating leases. Operating leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 5 years. The Company's corporate facility is located at 2220 Lundy Avenue, San Jose,\nCalifornia, 95131, where the Company occupies approximately 24,164 square feet of space. The original five-year lease was entered into in February 2019 and on October 24,\n2023, was extended to April 14, 2027 under similar terms. The Company's SensiML subsidiary in Beaverton, Oregon occupies approximately 925 square feet of space. The\noriginal four-year lease was entered into in April 2019 and on April 1, 2023, was extended to March 31, 2025 under similar terms. The Company maintains sales offices out of\nwhich it conducts sales and marketing activities in various countries outside of the United States. The sales offices are rented under short-term leases. Total rent expense was\napproximately $0.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides the activity related to operating leases (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nOperating lease costs:\nFixed $ 394 $ 409\nShort term 18 11\nTotal $ 412 $ 420\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for obligations lease:\nOperating leases $ 865 $ —\nTotal $ 865 $ —\nThe following table provides the details of supplemental cash flow information (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows used for operating leases $ 421 $ 409\nTotal $ 421 $ 409\nNon-cash ROU assets related to operating leases included in the operating cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were $348\nthousand and $345 thousand, respectively.\nThe following table provides the details of ROU assets and lease liabilities (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nRight-of-use assets:\nOperating leases $ 981 $ 464\nTotal $ 981 $ 464\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases $ 983 $ 507\nTotal $ 983 $ 507\nThe following table provides the details of future lease payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2023 and (in thousands):\nAnnual Fiscal Years Operating\n2024 $ 378\n2025 340\n2026 351\n2027 64\nTotal lease payments 1,133\nLess: Interest 150\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 983\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides the details of lease terms and discount rates:\nDecember 31, 2023\nROU assets:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 3.25\nWeighted-average discount rates:\nOperating leases 6.00%\nNOTE 9 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances were $24.6 million and $19.2 million, including amounts in money market funds, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The money market funds are collateral for the company's credit card debt and had a balance of $0.1 million at December\n31, 2023 and January 1, 2023. Interest in these funds is earned at a 0.01% annual percentage rate ( \"APR\"). Due to the short-term nature of the money market funds, the\nCompany believes that carrying value approximates fair value.\nOn April 28, 2023, the Company converted accounts receivable for a customer in the amount of approximately $1.16 million to notes receivable (the \"Note\"). At the\ntime, the Note bore an interest rate of 3.0% compounded monthly. On June 28, 2023, the Company cancelled the original note and entered into a revised promissory note with\nthe customer, where the interest rate changed to 4.69% compounded monthly, or a 4.8% effective annual interest rate, accruing from the date of the prior note. If not prepaid\nprior to the Note maturity date of June 28, 2024, the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to the Company. If an event of default occurs, the\ninterest rate will increase to 10.0%. All other terms of the note remained the same. The Company evaluated the note receivable under the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\")\nmodel, which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The CECL model does not specify a threshold for the recognition of an impairment allowance. The Company utilized the probability-of-\ndefault method to determine the current expected credit loss for the note receivable. Using this method, the Company measured the current expected credit loss associated with\nthe note receivable to be de minimis as of December 31, 2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, in connection with a revenue contract with the same non-affiliated customer, the Company received shares of the customer's common\nstock. The full transaction price under the revenue contract was cash plus a non-cash consideration, which consisted of a certain amount of the customer's equity. The Company\nconsidered the non-cash consideration to be an investment in the customer. The full transaction price was the amount of consideration which the Company received under the\ncontract in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to the customer. Since the non-cash consideration was shares of common stock that were not publicly\ntraded, the fair value was not readily determinable. The Company considered various valuation methods such as market multiples, guideline public company method, and the\nBlack-Scholes Option Pricing model. Due to limited data for the valuation, the Company ultimately selected the Black-Scholes method using back-solve techniques as that was\ndetermined to be the most suitable with the available data. The Black-Scholes Option Pricing model is a valuation approach that can be used to determine the value of common\nshares for companies in which there are no, or infrequent, transactions involving common shares. The Company believed that its valuation method for the non-public equity\nunder this arrangement fell under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the value method relied on unobservable market inputs. The initial fair value of the non-cash\nconsideration is listed below:\nFair Value at Valuation Date Using:\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Unobservable\nTotal (Level I) Inputs (Level 2) Inputs (Level 3)\nNon-marketable equity investment $ 300 $ — $ — $ 300\nIn arriving at the estimated value for the non-cash consideration, the Company utilized inputs relying on significant judgment in accordance with the AICPA\nAccounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (2013). The key assumptions below were utilized:\n• Discount for lack of marketability: 34% - 41%.\n• Expected Term: 4 - 5 Years.\n• Risk Free Interest Rate: 0.75% - 0.92%.\n• Dividend: 0.00.\n• Volatility: 63% - 78%.\nVolatility was estimated by utilizing a selected peer group of companies within the customer's industry with a valuation date as of October 2021.\nAfter initial recognition fair value of the non-cash consideration, the Company elected to utilize the practical expedient under ASC 321 by which entities can elect to\nmeasure equity securities without readily determinable fair values at “cost minus impairment,” basis for periods subsequent to the acquisition date. Under the “cost minus\nimpairment” methods, when the investment is determined to be impaired on the basis of a qualitative assessment or there is an observable price change in an orderly\ntransaction, entities that have made the election in ASC 321 must remeasure such equity securities at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 321 indicates that the\nadjustments to the carrying value of an equity security without a readily determinable fair value should reflect the fair value of the security as of the date that the observable\ntransaction for the similar security took place.\nSubsequent to the valuation date and through January 1, 2023, there were no observable indicators of impairment for the non-marketable equity investment. During\nFiscal 2023, there were no observable indicators of impairment for the non-marketable equity investment. There was no change to the carrying value of the non-marketable\nequity investment of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10 — INCOME TAXES\nThe components of loss before provision of income taxes and the components for the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nIncome (loss) before income taxes:\nU.S. $ (225) $ (4,116) $ (6,461)\nForeign (36) (53) (36)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ (261) $ (4,169) $ (6,497)\nProvision for income taxes:\nCurrent:\nState $ 9 $ 3 $ 3\nForeign (6) 36 22\nSubtotal 3 39 25\nDeferred:\nForeign (1) 59 94\nSubtotal (1) 59 94\nProvision for income taxes $ 2 $ 98 $ 119\nThe difference between income taxes computed at the statutory federal income tax rate and the provision for income taxes is attributable to the following (in\nthousands):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nIncome tax benefit at statutory rate $ (55) $ (876) $ (1,364)\nState taxes 9 3 3\nForeign taxes — 106 124\nStock compensation and other permanent differences (740) 21 (155)\nPPP loan forgiveness — — (250)\nR&D tax credits (480) (318) (230)\nExpired tax attributes 1,290 3,563 3,303\nFuture benefit of deferred tax assets not recognized (22) (2,401) (1,312)\nProvision for income taxes $ 2 $ 98 $ 119\nBased on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the U.S. net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable.\nAccordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023. Any future release of the\nvaluation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income. The Company believes it is more likely than not it will be able to realize its foreign deferred tax\nassets.\nSignificant components of the Company's deferred tax balances are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating losses $ 42,220 $ 43,110\nAccruals and reserves 1,569 1,284\nCredits carryforward 6,730 6,004\nDepreciation and amortization 5,841 6,488\nStock-based compensation 447 1\nOperating lease liability 216 327\nGross deferred tax assets 57,023 57,214\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use asset (215) (328)\nWithholding tax on future distribution (125) (125)\nGross deferred tax liabilities (340) (453)\nNet deferred tax assets 56,683 56,761\nValuation allowance (56,783) (56,862)\nTotal deferred tax liability $ (100) $ (101)\n53\nTable of Contents\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act”) eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and\nrequires taxpayers to capitalize such expenses pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. The capitalized expenses are amortized over a 5-year period for\ndomestic expenses and a 15-year period for foreign expenses. As a result of this provision of the Tax Act, the Company capitalized $8.5 million of research expenses in fiscal\nyear 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state income tax net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of approximately $169.5 million and $94.2\nmillion, respectively. Approximately $106.3 million in federal NOLs generated before January 1, 2018 expire beginning in 2024 through 2037. Federal NOLs of $63.2 million\ngenerated in years after January l, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. State NOLs will expire beginning in fiscal year 2028 through 2043. The Company had research\ncredit carryforwards of approximately $4.6 million for federal and $5.5 million for state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2023. If not utilized, the federal carryforwards\nwill expire beginning in 2026 through 2043. The California research credit carryforward can be carried forward indefinitely.\nDue to the Company's history of losses, it believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets and benefits from these federal and state NOL and credit\ncarryforwards will not be realized as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of $56.8 million, tax-effected, as of the Fiscal Year\nended December 31, 2023 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize its U.S. deferred tax assets before they expire.\nEvents which may restrict utilization of a company’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards include, but are not limited to, certain ownership change limitations\nas defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382(a) (\"Section 382\") and similar state provisions. In the event the Company has had a change of ownership, utilization of\ncarryforwards could be restricted to an annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards before\nutilization.\nThe Company performed a Section 382 Study related to ownership changes in fiscal year 2023, covering the period starting January 1, 2005 through December 31,\n2023. Per the Section 382 Study, there were no Section 382 ownership changes during this period. As a result, the future utilization of the Company's NOL and R&D credit\ncarryovers generated since 2005 are not subject to any limitations, assuming the Company does not experience an ownership change in the future.\nForeign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign\nsubsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2023. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes that future\ndomestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. In previous years, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $0.1 million\non the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. During fiscal 2023, there were no changes to this balance, and at December 31, 2023, the balance for this deferred tax\nliability was approximately $0.1 million. The foreign withholding taxes are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operation.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nChanges in gross unrecognized benefits are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 2,249 $ 2,118 $ 2,175\nAdditions (subtractions) for tax positions related to the prior year 2 — (7)\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 262 185 128\nLapse of statutes of limitations — (54) (178)\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 2,513 $ 2,249 $ 2,118\nOut of $2.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, there are no unrecognized tax benefits that would result in a change in the Company's effective tax rate if\nrecognized in future years. The accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was not significant as of December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2,\n2022.\nThe Company is not currently under tax examination in the U.S. and the Company’s historical net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be adjusted by the\nInternal Revenue Service and other tax authorities until the statute closes on the year in which such tax attributes are utilized. The Company estimates that its unrecognized tax\nbenefits will not change significantly within the next twelve months.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes in many U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The U.S.\ntax years from 2004 forward remain effectively open to examination due to the carryover of unused net operating losses and tax credits.\nNOTE 11 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is authorized to issue 200 million shares of common stock and has 10 million shares of authorized but unissued\nundesignated preferred stock.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the\nSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n59\nTable of Contents\nManagement, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as\nrequired by the applicable rules of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December\n31, 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies\nand procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, cost-effective internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting\nobjectives. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting\nfrom human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a\nrisk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\nassessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In making this\nassessment, we used the criteria based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013).” Based on the results of this assessment, management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) has concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nInsider Trading Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" (as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), except as follows:\nTimothy Saxe, Senior Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technology Officer, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement on November 21, 2023.

OVERVIEW\nIn accordance with the applicable rules The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”), Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of QuickLogic Corporation (the “Company”) has adopted this Policy (the “Policy”)\nto provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein\nshall have the meanings set forth in Section H, below.\nB. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(1) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in\naccordance with Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n(i) After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a\nmajority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nReceived by each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable.\n(a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting\nRestatement:\ni. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nAccounting Restatement on the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was\nReceived; and\nii. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as\nrequired to the Nasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts\nand circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less\nthan the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(iii) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative\nrecovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(iv) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all\nactions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive\nOfficer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering\nsuch Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n1\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section B(1) above if the Committee\n(which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the\nBoard) determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following two conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered.\nBefore making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such\nattempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Nasdaq; or\n(ii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail\nto meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\nC. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\nD. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid,\nreturned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company\nshall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this\nPolicy or that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into\nbefore, on or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nE. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this\nPolicy and for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or\nNasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nF. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this\nSection F to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken\nby the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nG. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by\napplicable law. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed\nto include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this\nPolicy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant\nto the terms of any policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.\n2\nH.
