For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when it\ndiscusses the potential commercialization and market opportunities for its products and product candidates, its cash runway, and its anticipated future milestone\nCompany events. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, are based on certain assumptions and are subject to various known and\nunknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and cannot be predicted or quantified and consequently, actual results may differ\nmaterially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties\nassociated with (i) market acceptance of our existing and new products, (ii) negative clinical trial results or lengthy product delays in key markets, (iii) an inability to\nsecure regulatory approvals for the sale of our products, (iv) intense competition in the medical device industry from much larger, multinational companies, (v) product\nliability claims, (vi) product malfunctions, (vii) our limited manufacturing capabilities and reliance on subcontractors for assistance, (viii) insufficient or inadequate\nreimbursement by governmental and other third party payors for our products, (ix) our efforts to successfully obtain and maintain intellectual property protection\ncovering our products, which may not be successful, (x) legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, (xi) our\nreliance on single suppliers for certain product components, (xii) the fact that we will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future\nand that such capital raising may be costly, dilutive or difficult to obtain and (xiii) the fact that we conduct business in multiple foreign jurisdictions, exposing us to\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, logistical and communications challenges, burdens and costs of compliance with foreign laws and political and economic\ninstability in each jurisdiction. More detailed information about the Company and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward- looking statements is set\nforth in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q. Investors and security holders are urged to read these documents free of charge on the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov.
