(NASDAQ & TASE: BWAY) (“BrainsWay” or the “Company”), a global leader in advanced noninvasive neurostimulation treatments for mental health disorders, today announced the publication of positive feasibility clinical data evaluating the analgesic effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (Deep TMS™) in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. The results were published in the _Neuromodulation_ journal, in a peer-reviewed [article](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mXgOL4BnKoHbbstEk2zPvBpsiBp_O3Bgt3QvUcTeZWpQ_rRTtxB8WuQoCgOOtILF_DClycQR4U4uhgzUVjYjN4o5yphTX2X2iYd8xoAPn8Acw5_vgLstSmgUCJ0hrDhOrd-xMafK96FCUPLXp1mbBA==) entitled, “ _H-Coil Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Relieves Pain and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Crossover Study_.”\n\nThe double-blind, randomized crossover trial included seventeen (17) patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were assigned to either an active Deep TMS or sham treatment arm for a five-day period, followed by a nine-week washout, before crossing over to the other arm. The study’s primary outcome measure was a comparison between the patterns of the active and sham groups’ self-reported changes in pain levels from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in pain ratings at specific time points in the two arms, as well as changes in comorbid symptoms experienced by the patients, including, for example, anxiety and depression. \n\nResults showed that Active deep-TMS therapy significantly reduced \"usual pain intensity\" in patients with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain compared to sham treatment and improved symptoms of anxiety and depression in the same patient population.\n\n“We are excited to announce the results from this double-blind crossover study of Deep TMS therapy revealing that five active Deep TMS sessions induced significantly stronger analgesic effects compared with sham stimulation over the course of the treatment, as well as statistically significant reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms,” said Hadar Levy, BrainsWay’s Chief Executive Officer. “The results of this study, which we hope to further explore with additional research, are the most recent dataset in a growing portfolio of clinical evidence on the potential efficacy of Deep TMS in treating multiple brain-related indications.”\n\nBrainsWay Deep TMS is not currently cleared by the FDA for the safe or effective treatment of neuropathic pain. Additional outcomes from research conducted on these and other neuropathic pain patients were recently [published](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nE3Qxdh8HwztAd6JD3P-7vRS69R1nDGDIQ5b9yvKec1RoL0dQGN_0Ux36qscXrvNkLcAQF_YTvkD5Qt_i3VLs2P6mKmD7dZvpO7WQxtM538u62riypEqmzVmMSPJI1Xg), lending additional support to the findings of this study on the potential benefits of Deep TMS.\n\n**About BrainsWay**\n\nBrainsWay is a global leader in advanced noninvasive neurostimulation treatments for mental health disorders. The Company is boldly advancing neuroscience with its proprietary Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS™) platform technology to improve health and transform lives.

(NASDAQ & TASE: BWAY) (“BrainsWay” or the “Company”), a global leader in advanced noninvasive neurostimulation treatments for mental health disorders, today reported third quarter 2024 financial results and provided an operational update.\n\n**Recent Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $10.5 million, a 26% increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n  * Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 74%, steady from the same period in 2023.\n  * Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.3 million, compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $1.1 million, compared to $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits totaled $48.4 million, reflecting a $0.3 million increase from June 30, 2024.\n  * Following the end of the third quarter, the Company closed on an equity financing by Valor Equity Partners, receiving gross proceeds of approximately $20 million to date, before deducting offering expenses and before any potential exercise of warrant rights by Valor.

Our focus remains on building sustainable growth by investing strategically in our long-term vision. Our commitment to driving innovation and expanding treatment possibilities is stronger than ever, with key investments across three core areas, including the development of our next-generation Deep TMS 360™ system, conducting clinical trials to broaden and enhance treatment capabilities, and expanding our commercial presence through targeted sales and marketing efforts. These critical investments reflect our dedication to leading the industry in mental health and neurological care, providing impactful and accessible solutions for patients worldwide,\" said Hadar Levy, BrainsWay’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\"Our recent private financing with Valor Equity Partners will enable us to explore new markets and revenue channels, including different customer types and commercial partnerships. This will further strengthen our potential for accelerated growth and enhance access to Deep TMS,\" concluded Mr. Levy.\n\n**Call and Webcast**\n\nBrainsWay’s management will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results and answer questions.\n\nTuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time:\n\nUnited States:| 1-877-300-8521  \n---|---  \nInternational:| 1-412-317-6026  \nIsrael:Conference ID:| 1-80-921-237310193781  \nWebcast:| [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1693565&tp_key=866e8470ea](https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1693565&tp_key=866e8470ea)  \n  \nThe conference call will be broadcast live and will be available for replay for 30 days on the Company’s website, [https://investors.brainsway.com/events-and-presentations/event-calendar](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z6YWg4K4moc8ULuvC7Hr3VJC0cHVdpKjks-Y6ZITzc8BmWG3Saf7KkJWU9EIbJMNzq6f71QFDc8vZXYjfdXsk26YHa7azbOgklypp4cg6qEIrw0Sve6bh01zK5RBvNHvBIwU3HA40OjaXp7iE7WZp7po99nRV97VTbi5nYcD1yBDn38XTvghmoRdIvkHNE8ljglyDbYIABOuDxVlLOLxqbhlmodtAPagK5qZ8Weil80=). Please access the Company’s website at least 10 minutes ahead of the conference call to register.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including in particular operating income and net income, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, finance income, finance expenses, income taxes, cost of share-based payments, and one-time restructuring and litigation expenses.\n\nIn addition to operating income (loss) and net income (loss), we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-IFRS financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization, finance expenses, income taxes, and certain one-time items such as restructuring and litigation expenses, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired.\n  * Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with IFRS financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-IFRS or non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. A reconciliation between the Company’s net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\n\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other IFRS-based financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our IFRS financial results.\n\n**About BrainsWay**\n\nBrainsWay is a global leader in advanced noninvasive neurostimulation treatments for mental health disorders.
