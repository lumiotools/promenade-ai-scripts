(“Zenas” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ZBIO), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to being a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunology-based therapies, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided recent corporate updates.\n\n“In the third quarter, we successfully completed our initial public offering, providing capital to fund our growth strategy for the Company and expand the clinical development of our lead product candidate, obexelimab, for the treatment of autoimmune diseases,” said Lonnie Moulder, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zenas. “With the achievement of targeted enrollment for INDIGO, the largest IgG4-RD clinical trial ever conducted, we expect to report topline results for this registration-directed study by the end of 2025.”\n\n**Recent corporate highlights**\n\n_Obexelimab_\n\nObexelimab is a bifunctional monoclonal antibody designed to bind both CD19 and FcγRIIb, which are broadly present across B cell lineage, to inhibit the activity of cells that are implicated in many autoimmune diseases without depleting them. This unique mechanism of action and self-administered, subcutaneous injection regimen may broadly and effectively address the pathogenic role of B cell lineage in chronic autoimmune disease.\n\n  * Completed targeted enrollment of the Phase 3 INDIGO trial, a global Phase 3 registration-directed, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of obexelimab in patients with IgG4-RD. With the completion of targeted enrollment for the largest clinical trial ever conducted in this patient population, the Company expects to report topline results for INDIGO by the end of 2025.\n  * Initiated the Phase 2 MoonStone trial, a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of obexelimab in patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The Company expects to report the 12-week primary endpoint results for MoonStone by the third quarter of 2025.\n  * Initiated the Phase 2 SunStone trial, a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of obexelimab to reduce disease activity in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SunStone remains on track to complete enrollment in 2025 and the Company expects to report topline results for SunStone in the first half of 2026.\n  * Continued enrollment in the Phase 2 SApHiAre trial, a global, multicenter, open-label safety and dose confirmation run-in period (SRP) to evaluate the safety and activity of obexelimab in patients with warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA). The Company expects to provide initial data for SApHiAre later this year.\n\n\n\n_Other corporate highlights_\n\nBeyond progress with obexelimab, during the third quarter and more recently, the Company:\n\n  * Completed its upsized initial public offering, raising approximately $258.7 million in gross proceeds, including full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, to fund its planned activities for obexelimab and the Company’s growth strategy.\n  * Bolstered its leadership team with the appointments of Chief Commercial Officer, Orlando Oliveira, and Chief Legal Officer, Jeff Held. With a career spanning nearly 25 years, Mr. Oliveira brings a wealth of experience building high-performing global commercial teams, driving revenue growth and fostering strategic partnerships within the biopharmaceutical industry, having served as head of international and commercial roles at Mirati Therapeutics (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb), Agios Pharmaceuticals (oncology business acquired by Servier) and at TESARO (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline). Mr. Held leads the Legal and Compliance function at Zenas and has over 30 years of legal experience at several publicly traded life sciences and private technology companies, including most recently as General Counsel at Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, where he built the legal and compliance function as Deciphera progressed from research through clinical development and commercial launches, along with executing on multiple equity financings and the sale of the company to ONO Pharmaceutical in June 2024.\n  * Out-licensed ZB005, a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to bind only to the active form of C1s. Zenas held the development and commercialization rights for ZB005 in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan through an exclusive license with Dianthus. In October 2024, Zenas BioPharma (HK) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zenas established in Hong Kong, entered into an agreement with a private, China-based biotechnology company, under which Zenas HK transferred its rights and obligations to ZB005 under the Company’s agreement with Dianthus to such party for a non-refundable upfront payment in addition to potential regulatory and commercial milestone payments. \n\n\n\n**Third quarter 2024 financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses were $33.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses primarily relates to increased costs for the clinical development and manufacturing of obexelimab.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $7.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in G&A cost was primarily due to increases in personnel and operations costs, as well as costs incurred to satisfy the requirements of becoming and operating as a public company.\n  * Net loss was $38.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $35.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, is the result of collaboration revenue received from an upfront payment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company when Zenas granted BMS an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize obexelimab in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash balance, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $386.8 million, which includes the net proceeds of $234.4 million from the Company’s IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as of September 30, 2024, will fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n\n\n**About Zenas BioPharma, Inc.**\n\nZenas is a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to becoming a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunology-based therapies for patients in need. Our core business strategy combines our experienced leadership team with a disciplined product candidate acquisition approach to identify, acquire and develop product candidates globally that we believe can provide superior clinical benefits to patients living with autoimmune diseases.

(“Zenas” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ZBIO), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to being a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunology-based therapies, today announced the completion of its targeted enrollment for the Phase 3 INDIGO trial of its lead product candidate, obexelimab, for the treatment of patients with IgG4-RD.\n\n“With the completion of targeted enrollment in our INDIGO trial, the largest IgG4-RD clinical trial ever conducted, Zenas has demonstrated its capabilities to execute on our expansive clinical development plans for obexelimab,” said Lonnie Moulder, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zenas. “Importantly, we expect to report topline results by the end of next year and advance the Company toward our goal of becoming a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunology-based therapies for patients in need.”\n\n**About the Phase 3 INDIGO Trial in IgG4-RD**\n\nThe Phase 3 INDIGO trial is a global, registration-directed, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of obexelimab in approximately 190 patients with active IgG4-RD and is being conducted at approximately 100 sites in 20 countries. Following an initial screening period, patients were randomized 1:1 to 250 mg of obexelimab or placebo administered as a subcutaneous injection every seven days for 52 weeks, followed by an opportunity for eligible patients to continue in an open-label extension period where all patients will receive treatment with obexelimab.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of INDIGO is the time to first IgG4-RD flare, as determined per protocol by the investigator and the adjudication committee. Secondary endpoints include annualized flare rate, the proportion of patients achieving complete remission, and use and quantity of rescue medication.\n\nMore information on the INDIGO trial (NCT05662241) is available at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=B4D6922p3_qfdRLc4bGA9LFfrz3arFqQ1ffc6rEe9-9Q8coWJnbgWRKXc1lo2ERSQnyrYFq57Vtm-sbnhI7YC5tH7TNFTH3w2HjWgIDs6ls=)\n\n**About Obexelimab**\n\nObexelimab is a bifunctional monoclonal antibody designed to bind both CD19 and FcγRIIb, which are broadly present across B cell lineage, to inhibit the activity of cells that are implicated in many autoimmune diseases without depleting them. This unique mechanism of action and self-administered, subcutaneous injection regimen may broadly and effectively address the pathogenic role of B cell lineage in chronic autoimmune disease.\n\nObexelimab has been evaluated in five completed clinical trials in a total of 198 patients who received obexelimab either as an intravenous infusion or as a subcutaneous injection. Obexelimab was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity across these five clinical trials, providing the Company an initial clinical proof of concept for obexelimab as a B cell inhibitor for the treatment of patients living with certain autoimmune diseases. Currently, Zenas is conducting multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of obexelimab in several autoimmune diseases including IgG4-RD, Multiple Sclerosis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.\n\n**About IgG4-RD**\n\nIgG4-RD is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disease that can affect virtually all organ systems, including the pancreas, biliary tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, lungs, and kidneys. Patients with IgG4-RD may present with a single organ involved but more frequently present with multiple organ involvement. As the disease progresses and patients experience new or worsening symptoms (i.e., flares), lesions develop in additional organs and the cellular inflammation characterizing early disease moves toward a more fibrotic stage, which can lead to major irreversible tissue damage and ultimately organ failure. We estimate that the currently diagnosed population of IgG4-RD patients in the U.S. is approximately 20,000, with comparable prevalence rates globally.\n\nDespite the growing recognition of IgG4-RD and advances in the understanding of its pathophysiology, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of this disease and there remains high unmet medical need. The current standard of care is treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs). Although GCs are initially effective, treatment with GCs can often result in various complications and co-morbidities. Most patients can relapse within 12 months of discontinuing GC treatment, and maintenance therapy with GCs has not been shown to prevent recurrence of disease.\n\nThe pathogenesis of IgG4-RD suggests that B cell-targeted therapies may provide therapeutic benefit. Although not approved by any regulatory authorities to treat IgG4-RD, certain B cell depleting agents (e.g. rituximab) are occasionally administered to patients with IgG4-RD. However, B cell depleting agents are often associated with infections, including serious opportunistic infections, and can compromise a patient’s ability to mount a response to vaccinations.\n\n**About Zenas BioPharma, Inc.**\n\nZenas is a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company committed to becoming a leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunology-based therapies for patients in need. Our core business strategy combines our experienced leadership team with a disciplined product candidate acquisition approach to identify, acquire and develop product candidates globally that we believe can provide superior clinical benefits to patients living with autoimmune diseases.

Our core business strategy combines our experienced leadership team with a disciplined product candidate acquisition approach to identify, acquire and develop product candidates globally that we believe can provide superior clinical benefits to patients living with autoimmune diseases. Zenas’ lead product candidate, obexelimab, is a bifunctional monoclonal antibody designed to bind both CD19 and FcγRIIb, which are broadly present across B cell lineage, to inhibit the activity of cells that are implicated in many autoimmune diseases without depleting them. We believe that obexelimab’s mechanism of action and chronic dosing regimen may broadly and effectively address the pathogenic role of B cell lineage in chronic autoimmune disease.
