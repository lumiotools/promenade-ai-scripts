(NASDAQ: AISP) (“Airship AI” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.9 million. \n  * Gross profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.2 million. \n  * Gross margin percentage was 75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Higher margins were in part due to product mix, with reduced equipment purchases and increased Outpost AI sales. \n  * Operating loss was $1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which reflected increased stock based compensation and overall sales levels. \n  * Other income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $7.8 million, primarily due to a gain from a change in the fair value of earnout liability of $5.5 million, change in fair value of warrant liability of $1.5 million and change in fair value of convertible debt of $0.4 million. \n  * Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $6.2 million, or $0.25 per basic share, primarily related to noncash income of $7.8 million. \n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents was $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024. \n  * Closed an $8 million public offering with net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million, after deducting the estimated offering expenses, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 & Subsequent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Backlog as of September 30, 2024, was $6.6 million, representing firm fixed price contracts awarded in the second and third quarter that will be shipped and invoiced in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025. Backlog is not indicative of future quarterly revenue as approximately 75% of quarterly revenue is transactional and recognized in the same quarter.\n  * Our total validated pipeline at the end of the quarter was approximately $130 million, consisting of single and multi-year opportunities for AI-driven edge, video, and sensor and data management platform across all our customer verticals. Our pipeline includes opportunities at varying stages of progression with expected award timeframes throughout the next 18-24 months.\n  * Due to the sensitive nature of many of our customers and deployment use cases, we are often restricted from publicly disclosing awards and or limited as to the specifics of the customer and use case. Consequently, the vast majority of our awards are executed on closed or restricted contract vehicles which further limits the sharing of information that might be otherwise available.\n  * Multiple large contracts awarded throughout the quarter including but not limited to: \n    * **$4.0 million firm-fixed price contract for an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), for advanced integrated solutions supporting real-time intelligence collection operations along the United States’ borders, leveraging the Company’s edge IoT appliance, Outpost AI.**\n    * **$1.2 million firm-fixed price support and maintenance contract for our existing deployment of Acropolis Enterprise Video and Data Management Platform supporting a Fortune 100 Transportation and E-Commerce company’ global operations.**\n  * We successfully completed a pilot opportunity to replace failing capabilities within critical infrastructure on the U.S. southern border, leading to an Airship AI brand-name only award that will be shipped and installed in the fourth quarter of 2024. This initial award is in support of our single-largest opportunity, valued at more than $50 million over the next four (4) years. Estimated total contract value is conservatively based on data points from published market research, including size and scope, and pricing approved via awarded procurement efforts.\n  * We participated in JIFX, or Joint Interagency Field Exercise, an invite only event led by the Naval Post-Graduate School. The JIFX team leads experimentation in alternative methods to enable rapid technological development by cultivating a community of interest and hosting broadly scoped quarterly collaborative field events which enable DoD, US government, and allied stakeholders to identify, influence, and accelerate early-stage technology development that address national and collective security challenges.\n  * We participated in TIDE, or Technology Innovation Discovery Event, an invite only Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored event that aims to help innovative small businesses and non-traditional DoD performers showcase new hardware and software technologies that can significantly improve existing software or meet new challenges in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n  * We were a primary sponsor of and participant in UTAC, the premier unmanned aerial and robotic systems tactical event for Police, Public Safety, Government, and Defense agencies. UTAC is a fully immersive training event where public safety, government, enterprise, and defense operators gather to learn best practices, establish procedures, and gain experience with the latest innovations in unmanned aerial, ground, and maritime systems along augmenting technical solutions.\n  * Completed $8.0 million at-market public offering with net proceeds to the company of $7.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. \n  * **Capital Markets Update:**\n    * Airship AI to commence regular quarterly conference calls in conjunction with financial results reporting in Fiscal 2025.\n    * Airship AI to participate at the 13th Annual ROTH Technology Conference in New York City on November 19-20, 2024.\n    * Benchmark Company initiated coverage of Airship AI on November 13, 2024, with a Buy rating and price target of $6.\n    * Airship AI to participate at the 13th Annual Discovery One-on-One Conference in New York City on December 11, 2024.\n\n\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\n  * Triple-digit revenue growth and positive cash flow for calendar year 2024 supported by a strong and validated pipeline of ~$130 million, improving gross profit margins, and a strong recurring revenue model. \n  * Make tactical and strategic investments across our sales and business development organizations through organic cash flow from business operations and the cash exercise of public warrants. \n  * Release new Outpost AI product offerings as well as expand custom trained AI models supporting emerging edge analytic workflows. \n  * Continued innovation across our core Acropolis software platform supporting new workflows for cloud-based deployments in highly secure operational environments. \n  * Develop and execute expansionary opportunities in the commercial and retail markets, particularly around those companies involved in combating organized retail crime (“ORC”). \n  * Improve sourcing, supply chain management and production-based process efficiencies to help drive continued margin expansion. \n  * Targeted focus on brand awareness and engagement in new verticals through targeted marketing outreach opportunities, social media platforms, Airship AI hosted technology events, and industry tradeshow events. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 saw continued momentum in support of our trajectory for triple-digit revenue growth for the full year,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “Our team was able to generate solid revenues for the quarter of $2.9 million at a gross margin percentage of 75%, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin percentages above 70%. We ended the quarter with $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million in accounts receivables.\n\n\"Historically, our third quarter tends to be slower due to the focus on the U.S. Government’s fiscal year-end, during which many of our larger opportunities go out for bid in the September timeframe. We also saw several large opportunities pushed out to FY 2025 or drastically cut due to budget challenges across several federal agencies. Additionally, the completion of the capital raise late in the quarter caused delays in bringing in several opportunities as the funds were needed to cover the cost of goods sold for those opportunities. Despite these headwinds, we achieved 18% year-over-year growth in net revenue for the quarter and 61% net revenue growth as compared to full year 2023 revenue of $12.3 million.\n\n\"While our recently completed capital raise did not close in time to be reflected in the Q3 results, it has significantly enhanced our ability to execute large transactions, particularly those involving substantial up-front costs of goods sold. The capital raise has also enabled us to expand our sales, business development, and partner marketing capabilities by bringing in specialized industry expertise and experience in managing large-scale defense programs. We have already made progress toward this objective with the addition of several high-caliber team members, and we are in the process of bringing on even more talent to further strengthen our capabilities.\n\n\"With former President Trump's election as president-elect and his stated commitment to rapidly increase investments in securing the border, we are already seeing a positive shift in the market dynamics surrounding our pipeline. Currently our pipeline is heavily weighted to initiatives directly supporting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This positions us exceptionally well to capitalize on increased investments in technology supporting securing the border as it leverages our strong relationship as an established, trusted partner of CBP, with a proven track record of successful software and hardware deployments across the agency.\n\n“Building on our established presence in the federal law enforcement investigative environment, our rapidly expanding footprint in the broader federal market, including the Department of Defense (DoD), positions us to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven capabilities at the edge, an area where we have made significant investments. By transforming existing “dumb” sensors that require constant monitoring into autonomous systems that proactively alert users when specific conditions are met, we are not only revolutionizing homeland security, but also enhancing digital operations on battlefields worldwide,” concluded Mr. Allen.\n\n**About Airship AI Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 2006, Airship AI (NASDAQ: AISP) is a U.S. owned and operated technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

(NASDAQ: AISP) (“Airship AI” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, has been awarded a $4.0 million single year fixed firm price contract to an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the Company’s Acropolis Enterprise Sensor Management video and data management platform, Outpost AI edge IoT appliances, and integrated solutions leveraging Airship AI capabilities supporting emerging public safety and investigative requirements.\n\n“This award represents a continuation of our support to the agency for a wide range of AI driven technical surveillance requirements along the Northern and Southern Borders,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “Due to the sheer magnitude of the challenges facing the front line agents tasked with securing the border to counter human trafficking and stem the tide of fentanyl and other narcotics flowing into the United States, technology-driven force multipliers are becoming more and more critical. Innovation through the utilization of AI to support data-driven operations is just one way that Airship AI is enabling the agency to use technology to take agents out from behind monitors and put them back into the field.”\n\nAirship AI’s Acropolis backend enterprise management system enables customers to manage devices and sensors across their entire digital ecosystem from a single web-based graphical user interface, creating significant cost savings for agencies with sensors and devices from dozens of different manufacturers. Airship AI’s approach to being sensor agnostic allows our platform to be that middleware application which fuses together data, and displays it in a simple and intuitive manner enabling data consumers to respond quickly and efficiently.\n\n“This award validates the critical nature of the solutions that we are continuing to develop which turn dumb sensors into smart sensors through the addition of our edge AI appliance, allowing agencies to leverage existing sensors and platforms already in use and avoid costly “rip and replace” strategies that would otherwise be necessary,” added Mr. Allen. “Also included in this award is our newly released Outpost AI appliance with a built-in cellular modem which, when combined with our highly efficient data encoding and encryption, is a game changer for operational environments where communication and backhaul challenges exist. This, combined with the extensions of support and maintenance agreements for previously provided capabilities, ensures seamless operations for the agency over the next year.”\n\nAirship AI’s Outpost AI Edge Appliance processes, analyzes, and encrypts data in real-time at the edge. Utilizing custom trained models tailored for the wide range of operational environments in which our customers operate, Airship AI can identify user-defined objects of interest in real-time and then control attached sensors to provide additional intelligence on the objects of interest. Supported by integrations with leading mesh, satellite, and other RF based backhaul solutions, Outpost AI supports the larger sensor agnostic approach of Airship AI’s Acropolis backend end platform.\n\nTo experience how Airship AI and its suite of enterprise video and data management solutions can help your organization solve your complex video and data management challenges, please email your request to [info@airship.ai](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4eaDQWTIQ7w0pOaMF7RlTB3NCkO2WU4Yb1Nm_cNivCuBdOuqoOo8YgX8ALLoNuoBeUFjKPPTHfHreNKkxqxLrw== \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Airship AI Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 2006, Airship AI is a U.S.-owned and operated technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

(NASDAQ: AISP) (“Airship AI” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, has been recently awarded numerous purchase orders for multiple state and local law enforcement organizations across the United States.\n\nAirship AI’s Acropolis platform has long been acknowledged as a platform of choice in the federal law enforcement space, supporting over a dozen different customers with large, federated camera and sensor deployments running in challenging operational environments. As those agencies have worked with state and local law enforcement agencies as part of joint operations, awareness of Airship’s platform has rapidly become a go-to solution in the much larger regional marketplace.\n\n“The ability for state and local law enforcement agencies to leverage the same highly secure platform used at the federal level is a game changer. It allows everyone to operate on a common, intuitive platform while differentiating between the permissions and authorities of the various agencies,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “Additionally, because of the technical investigative workflow similarities between various law enforcement levels, customers are ensured that the latest sensors and capabilities, regardless of third-party manufacturer, will perform in Airship AI’s platform.”\n\nIn addition to the efficiencies gained by sharing a common platform for collecting digital evidence, agencies have access to Airship AI’s digital evidence management system, Evidence Discovery Server (“EDS”), which allows agencies to ingest video, audio, and other digital evidence from Airship and other sources and manage them in a Criminal Justice Information Services (“CJIS”) compliant system with the same strict permission and authority workflow as our management software. This workflow also allows for the export of digital evidence to other third-party digital evidence platforms for management and long-term storage.\n\n“With awards this year at the state level in Texas, Maryland, and Connecticut, large municipalities including New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, and numerous smaller local police and sheriff’s departments, we’re excited about our rapid growth in this space. Looking forward, with an estimated 17,500 state and local agencies in the United States as of June 2018 per to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, we have substantial room for growth, supported by partner agency recommendations, targeted sales and marketing outreach, and partner-based collaborations,” concluded Mr. Allen.\n\nTo experience how Airship AI and its suite of enterprise video and data management solutions can help your organization solve your complex video and data management challenges, please email your request to [info@airship.ai](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-9rqOtfYlZPy-_rPPu9i6DAAYOy5nB_Z6jeQvDy6rybUHFsybmBnbjMSWCPOv3l44fBWzH-yY5Q0XcKoWFdyGA== \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Airship AI Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 2006, Airship AI is a U.S. owned and operated technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

(NASDAQ: AISP) (“Airship AI” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.9 million. \n  * Gross profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.2 million. \n  * Gross margin percentage was 75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Higher margins were in part due to product mix, with reduced equipment purchases and increased Outpost AI sales. \n  * Operating loss was $1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which reflected increased stock based compensation and overall sales levels. \n  * Other income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $7.8 million, primarily due to a gain from a change in the fair value of earnout liability of $5.5 million, change in fair value of warrant liability of $1.5 million and change in fair value of convertible debt of $0.4 million. \n  * Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $6.2 million, or $0.25 per basic share, primarily related to noncash income of $7.8 million. \n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents was $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024. \n  * Closed an $8 million public offering with net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million, after deducting the estimated offering expenses, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 & Subsequent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Backlog as of September 30, 2024, was $6.6 million, representing firm fixed price contracts awarded in the second and third quarter that will be shipped and invoiced in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025. Backlog is not indicative of future quarterly revenue as approximately 75% of quarterly revenue is transactional and recognized in the same quarter.\n  * Our total validated pipeline at the end of the quarter was approximately $130 million, consisting of single and multi-year opportunities for AI-driven edge, video, and sensor and data management platform across all our customer verticals. Our pipeline includes opportunities at varying stages of progression with expected award timeframes throughout the next 18-24 months.\n  * Due to the sensitive nature of many of our customers and deployment use cases, we are often restricted from publicly disclosing awards and or limited as to the specifics of the customer and use case. Consequently, the vast majority of our awards are executed on closed or restricted contract vehicles which further limits the sharing of information that might be otherwise available.\n  * Multiple large contracts awarded throughout the quarter including but not limited to: \n    * **$4.0 million firm-fixed price contract for an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), for advanced integrated solutions supporting real-time intelligence collection operations along the United States’ borders, leveraging the Company’s edge IoT appliance, Outpost AI.**\n    * **$1.2 million firm-fixed price support and maintenance contract for our existing deployment of Acropolis Enterprise Video and Data Management Platform supporting a Fortune 100 Transportation and E-Commerce company’ global operations.**\n  * We successfully completed a pilot opportunity to replace failing capabilities within critical infrastructure on the U.S. southern border, leading to an Airship AI brand-name only award that will be shipped and installed in the fourth quarter of 2024. This initial award is in support of our single-largest opportunity, valued at more than $50 million over the next four (4) years. Estimated total contract value is conservatively based on data points from published market research, including size and scope, and pricing approved via awarded procurement efforts.\n  * We participated in JIFX, or Joint Interagency Field Exercise, an invite only event led by the Naval Post-Graduate School. The JIFX team leads experimentation in alternative methods to enable rapid technological development by cultivating a community of interest and hosting broadly scoped quarterly collaborative field events which enable DoD, US government, and allied stakeholders to identify, influence, and accelerate early-stage technology development that address national and collective security challenges.\n  * We participated in TIDE, or Technology Innovation Discovery Event, an invite only Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored event that aims to help innovative small businesses and non-traditional DoD performers showcase new hardware and software technologies that can significantly improve existing software or meet new challenges in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n  * We were a primary sponsor of and participant in UTAC, the premier unmanned aerial and robotic systems tactical event for Police, Public Safety, Government, and Defense agencies. UTAC is a fully immersive training event where public safety, government, enterprise, and defense operators gather to learn best practices, establish procedures, and gain experience with the latest innovations in unmanned aerial, ground, and maritime systems along augmenting technical solutions.\n  * Completed $8.0 million at-market public offering with net proceeds to the company of $7.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. \n  * **Capital Markets Update:**\n    * Airship AI to commence regular quarterly conference calls in conjunction with financial results reporting in Fiscal 2025.\n    * Airship AI to participate at the 13th Annual ROTH Technology Conference in New York City on November 19-20, 2024.\n    * Benchmark Company initiated coverage of Airship AI on November 13, 2024, with a Buy rating and price target of $6.\n    * Airship AI to participate at the 13th Annual Discovery One-on-One Conference in New York City on December 11, 2024.\n\n\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\n  * Triple-digit revenue growth and positive cash flow for calendar year 2024 supported by a strong and validated pipeline of ~$130 million, improving gross profit margins, and a strong recurring revenue model. \n  * Make tactical and strategic investments across our sales and business development organizations through organic cash flow from business operations and the cash exercise of public warrants. \n  * Release new Outpost AI product offerings as well as expand custom trained AI models supporting emerging edge analytic workflows. \n  * Continued innovation across our core Acropolis software platform supporting new workflows for cloud-based deployments in highly secure operational environments. \n  * Develop and execute expansionary opportunities in the commercial and retail markets, particularly around those companies involved in combating organized retail crime (“ORC”). \n  * Improve sourcing, supply chain management and production-based process efficiencies to help drive continued margin expansion. \n  * Targeted focus on brand awareness and engagement in new verticals through targeted marketing outreach opportunities, social media platforms, Airship AI hosted technology events, and industry tradeshow events. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 saw continued momentum in support of our trajectory for triple-digit revenue growth for the full year,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “Our team was able to generate solid revenues for the quarter of $2.9 million at a gross margin percentage of 75%, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin percentages above 70%. We ended the quarter with $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million in accounts receivables.\n\n\"Historically, our third quarter tends to be slower due to the focus on the U.S. Government’s fiscal year-end, during which many of our larger opportunities go out for bid in the September timeframe. We also saw several large opportunities pushed out to FY 2025 or drastically cut due to budget challenges across several federal agencies. Additionally, the completion of the capital raise late in the quarter caused delays in bringing in several opportunities as the funds were needed to cover the cost of goods sold for those opportunities. Despite these headwinds, we achieved 18% year-over-year growth in net revenue for the quarter and 61% net revenue growth as compared to full year 2023 revenue of $12.3 million.\n\n\"While our recently completed capital raise did not close in time to be reflected in the Q3 results, it has significantly enhanced our ability to execute large transactions, particularly those involving substantial up-front costs of goods sold. The capital raise has also enabled us to expand our sales, business development, and partner marketing capabilities by bringing in specialized industry expertise and experience in managing large-scale defense programs. We have already made progress toward this objective with the addition of several high-caliber team members, and we are in the process of bringing on even more talent to further strengthen our capabilities.\n\n\"With former President Trump's election as president-elect and his stated commitment to rapidly increase investments in securing the border, we are already seeing a positive shift in the market dynamics surrounding our pipeline. Currently our pipeline is heavily weighted to initiatives directly supporting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This positions us exceptionally well to capitalize on increased investments in technology supporting securing the border as it leverages our strong relationship as an established, trusted partner of CBP, with a proven track record of successful software and hardware deployments across the agency.\n\n“Building on our established presence in the federal law enforcement investigative environment, our rapidly expanding footprint in the broader federal market, including the Department of Defense (DoD), positions us to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven capabilities at the edge, an area where we have made significant investments. By transforming existing “dumb” sensors that require constant monitoring into autonomous systems that proactively alert users when specific conditions are met, we are not only revolutionizing homeland security, but also enhancing digital operations on battlefields worldwide,” concluded Mr. Allen.\n\n**About Airship AI Holdings, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 2006, Airship AI (NASDAQ: AISP) is a U.S. owned and operated technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

Higher\nmargins were in part due to product mix, with reduced equipment purchases and\nincreased Outpost AI sales.\nOperating loss was $1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which\nreflected increased stock based compensation and overall sales levels.\nOther income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $7.8 million, primarily\ndue to a gain from a change in the fair value of earnout liability of $5.5 million, change\nin fair value of warrant liability of $1.5 million and change in fair value of convertible\ndebt of $0.4 million.\nNet income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $6.2 million, or $0.25 per\nbasic share, primarily related to noncash income of $7.8 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million in the quarter ended September\n30, 2024.\nCash and cash equivalents was $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024.\nClosed an $8 million public offering with net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million,\nafter deducting the estimated offering expenses, in the quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\nQ3 2024 & Subsequent Operational Highlights\nBacklog as of September 30, 2024, was $6.6 million, representing firm fixed price\ncontracts awarded in the second and third quarter that will be shipped and invoiced in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025. Backlog is not indicative of future\nquarterly revenue as approximately 75% of quarterly revenue is transactional and\nrecognized in the same quarter.\nOur total validated pipeline at the end of the quarter was approximately $130 million,\nconsisting of single and multi-year opportunities for AI-driven edge, video, and sensor\nand data management platform across all our customer verticals. Our pipeline includes\nopportunities at varying stages of progression with expected award timeframes\nthroughout the next 18-24 months.\nDue to the sensitive nature of many of our customers and deployment use cases, we\nare often restricted from publicly disclosing awards and or limited as to the specifics of\nthe customer and use case. Consequently, the vast majority of our awards are\nexecuted on closed or restricted contract vehicles which further limits the sharing of\ninformation that might be otherwise available.\nMultiple large contracts awarded throughout the quarter including but not limited to:\n$4.0 million firm-fixed price contract for an agency within the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), for advanced integrated\nsolutions supporting real-time intelligence collection operations along the\nUnited States’ borders, leveraging the Company’s edge IoT appliance,\nOutpost AI.\n$1.2 million firm-fixed price support and maintenance contract for our\nexisting deployment of Acropolis Enterprise Video and Data Management\nPlatform supporting a Fortune 100 Transportation and E-Commerce\ncompany’ global operations.\nWe successfully completed a pilot opportunity to replace failing capabilities within\ncritical infrastructure on the U.S. southern border, leading to an Airship AI brand-name\nonly award that will be shipped and installed in the fourth quarter of 2024. This initial\naward is in support of our single-largest opportunity, valued at more than $50 million\nover the next four (4) years. Estimated total contract value is conservatively based on\ndata points from published market research, including size and scope, and pricing\napproved via awarded procurement efforts.\nWe participated in JIFX, or Joint Interagency Field Exercise, an invite only event led by\nthe Naval Post-Graduate School. The JIFX team leads experimentation in alternative\nmethods to enable rapid technological development by cultivating a community of\ninterest and hosting broadly scoped quarterly collaborative field events which enable\nDoD, US government, and allied stakeholders to identify, influence, and accelerate\nearly-stage technology development that address national and collective security\nchallenges.\nWe participated in TIDE, or Technology Innovation Discovery Event, an invite only\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) sponsored event that aims to help innovative small\nbusinesses and non-traditional DoD performers showcase new hardware and software\ntechnologies that can significantly improve existing software or meet new challenges in\nsupport of the National Defense Strategy.\nWe were a primary sponsor of and participant in UTAC, the premier unmanned aerial\nand robotic systems tactical event for Police, Public Safety, Government, and Defense\nagencies. UTAC is a fully immersive training event where public safety, government,\nenterprise, and defense operators gather to learn best practices, establish procedures,\nand gain experience with the latest innovations in unmanned aerial, ground, and\nmaritime systems along augmenting technical solutions.\nCompleted $8.0 million at-market public offering with net proceeds to the company of\n$7.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.\nCapital Markets Update:\nAirship AI to commence regular quarterly conference calls in conjunction with\nfinancial results reporting in Fiscal 2025.\nAirship AI to participate at the 13th Annual ROTH Technology Conference in New\nYork City on November 19-20, 2024.\nBenchmark Company initiated coverage of Airship AI on November 13, 2024,\nwith a Buy rating and price target of $6.\nAirship AI to participate at the 13th Annual Discovery One-on-One Conference in\nNew York City on December 11, 2024.\n2024 Outlook\nTriple-digit revenue growth and positive cash flow for calendar year 2024 supported by\na strong and validated pipeline of ~$130 million, improving gross profit margins, and a\nstrong recurring revenue model.\nMake tactical and strategic investments across our sales and business development\norganizations through organic cash flow from business operations and the cash\nexercise of public warrants.\nRelease new Outpost AI product offerings as well as expand custom trained AI models\nsupporting emerging edge analytic workflows.\nContinued innovation across our core Acropolis software platform supporting new\nworkflows for cloud-based deployments in highly secure operational environments.\nDevelop and execute expansionary opportunities in the commercial and retail markets,\nparticularly around those companies involved in combating organized retail crime\n(“ORC”).\nImprove sourcing, supply chain management and production-based process\nefficiencies to help drive continued margin expansion.\nTargeted focus on brand awareness and engagement in new verticals through targeted\nmarketing outreach opportunities, social media platforms, Airship AI hosted technology\nevents, and industry tradeshow events.\nManagement Commentary\n“The third quarter of 2024 saw continued momentum in support of our trajectory for triple-\ndigit revenue growth for the full year,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “Our team was\nable to generate solid revenues for the quarter of $2.9 million at a gross margin percentage\nof 75%, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin percentages above 70%. We ended\nthe quarter with $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million in accounts\nreceivables.\n\"Historically, our third quarter tends to be slower due to the focus on the U.S. Government’s\nfiscal year-end, during which many of our larger opportunities go out for bid in the\nSeptember timeframe. We also saw several large opportunities pushed out to FY 2025 or\ndrastically cut due to budget challenges across several federal agencies. Additionally, the\ncompletion of the capital raise late in the quarter caused delays in bringing in several\nopportunities as the funds were needed to cover the cost of goods sold for those\nopportunities. Despite these headwinds, we achieved 18% year-over-year growth in net\nrevenue for the quarter and 61% net revenue growth as compared to full year 2023 revenue\nof $12.3 million.\n\"While our recently completed capital raise did not close in time to be reflected in the Q3\nresults, it has significantly enhanced our ability to execute large transactions, particularly\nthose involving substantial up-front costs of goods sold. The capital raise has also enabled\nus to expand our sales, business development, and partner marketing capabilities by\nbringing in specialized industry expertise and experience in managing large-scale defense\nprograms. We have already made progress toward this objective with the addition of several\nhigh-caliber team members, and we are in the process of bringing on even more talent to\nfurther strengthen our capabilities.\n\"With former President Trump's election as president-elect and his stated commitment to\nrapidly increase investments in securing the border, we are already seeing a positive shift in\nthe market dynamics surrounding our pipeline. Currently our pipeline is heavily weighted to\ninitiatives directly supporting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP). This positions us exceptionally well to capitalize on\nincreased investments in technology supporting securing the border as it leverages our\nstrong relationship as an established, trusted partner of CBP, with a proven track record of\nsuccessful software and hardware deployments across the agency.\n“Building on our established presence in the federal law enforcement investigative\nenvironment, our rapidly expanding footprint in the broader federal market, including the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), positions us to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-\ndriven capabilities at the edge, an area where we have made significant investments. By\ntransforming existing “dumb” sensors that require constant monitoring into autonomous\nsystems that proactively alert users when specific conditions are met, we are not only\nrevolutionizing homeland security, but also enhancing digital operations on battlefields\nworldwide,” concluded Mr. Allen.\nAbout Airship AI Holdings, Inc.\nFounded in 2006, Airship AI (NASDAQ: AISP) is a U.S. owned and operated technology\ncompany headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

Organization\nAirship AI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Airship”) is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that executes business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Airship\nAI, Inc. (“Airship AI”). Prior to the formation of Super Simple AI, Inc. in 2022, the Company operated as Airship AI, Inc. (formerly known as JDL Digital Systems, Inc.). On\nMarch 7, 2023, Super Simple AI, Inc. changed its name to Airship AI Holdings, Inc. Super Simple AI, Inc. was formed in January 2022 through a share exchange with JDL\nDigital Systems, Inc. JDL Digital Systems, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on June 30, 2003.\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2023 and amended on September 22, 2023, by and\namong BYTE Acquisition Corp. (“BYTS”), BYTE Merger Sub, Inc., a Washington corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BYTS (“Merger Sub”), and Airship\nAI.\nEffective December 21, 2023, Merger Sub merged with and into Airship AI with Airship AI as the surviving corporation. Thus, Airship AI became a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof the Company. In connection with the merger, Airship AI changed its name from “Airship AI Holdings, Inc.” to “Airship AI, Inc.” See Note 11 —Reverse Recapitalization\nfor additional information.\nFair Value Transactions\nAs a result of the merger, the Company entered into the following transactions that were measured at fair value and vary quarterly with the share price and other items. Any\nchange is non-cash and is recorded as a gain or loss in other income (expense). See Note 14– Fair Value Measurements for more information.\nLiability as of Liability as of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nEarnout liability $ 6,229,390 $ 5,133,428\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes 1,793,360 2,825,366\nWarrant liability (Public Warrants) 3,393,393 646,428\nWarrant liability (Private Warrants) 108,150 21,557\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 11,524,293 $ 8,626,779\nOther loss related to instruments recorded at fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 $ (4,071,156) $ (400,921)\nCommon Stock and Warrant Offering\nOn September 3, 2024, the Company closed an $8 million public offering with net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million, after deducting the estimated offering expenses\npayable by the Company, including the placement agent fees. The offering consisted of 2,882,883 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of\n2,882,883 shares of its common stock at a combined public offering price of $2.775 per share and associated common stock warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of\n$2.65 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and will expire five years following the date of issuance. The warrants are classified as a component of permanent\nequity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued,\ndo not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed numbers of shares of common stock upon exercise.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including cost of goods sold purchases, personnel and\nproduct development.\n7\nTable of Contents\nPrivate Placement and Public Warrants\nAt the merger closing, the Company assumed 515,000 private placement warrants and 16,184,612 public warrants. On June 3, 2024, the Company permanently reduced the\nexercise price of such warrants from $11.50 per share to an exercise price of $7.80 per share. The purpose of this reduced exercise price was to potentially raise proceeds\nreceived from the exercise of such warrants, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were 515,000 private placement\nwarrants and 16,159,012 public warrants outstanding. See Note 12– Private Placement and Public Warrants for more information.\nBusiness\nThe Company is a robust AI-driven data management platform that solves complex data challenges for large institutions operating in dynamic and mission-critical environments\nwith rapidly increasing volumes of data being ingested from a similarly rapidly growing number of data sources.\nThe Company solves these challenges by structuring “dark” or unstructured data at the edge, the location at which the data is generated and collected, and leveraging purpose-\nbuilt AI models. Unstructured, or “dark” data, which is typically categorized as qualitative data, cannot be processed and analyzed via conventional data tools and methods.\nConversely, structured data, typically categorized as quantitative data, is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms.\nStructuring and then analyzing data using AI models at the edge, versus transmitting the data from the edge back to a central processing location for structuring and analysis,\nenables real-time decision making and data-driven operational efficiency.\nThe Company specializes in ingesting all available metadata from edge-based sensors used by government and law enforcement agencies around the world, including\nsurveillance cameras (video), audio, telemetry, acoustic, seismic, and autonomous devices, along with large commercial corporations with fundamentally similar capabilities and\nrequirements.\nData generated by these edge-based sensors, including video, can then be run through the Company’s trained AI models to detect objects present within the video frame. Once\nan object is detected, for example an automobile, additional identifying characteristics of the object can be extracted from the image including the license plate characters and\nthe make, model, and color of the automobile. This process of analyzing, logging and categorizing ingested data is referred to as “structuring” the data.\nAirship AI’s software allows customers to view structured data both in real-time as well as to conduct searches on the structured data at a later point in time. Real-time\nstructured data use includes, for example, alarms on a specific license plate or a specific make, model or color of automobile. Non-real-time structured data use includes, for\nexample, searching a database of video data that has been previously ingested and stored to find instances of a particular license plate being visible, along with other logged\nvehicle characteristics such as make, model and color of an automobile.\nAdditional edge deployed AI models enable similar object detection and recognition of common and custom trained objects, such as an aircraft, boat, person, animal, bag, or\nweapon. Airship AI’s models provide similar data points for these object types allowing analysts the ability to be notified in real-time of the detection of a specified object and\nsimilarly search for historically detected objects. Examples include detecting aircrafts and boats along with their respective tail numbers and hull registration numbers.\nThe Company’s AI modelling process starts with pre-trained AI models from its technology ecosystem partners which the Company then customizes using proprietary datasets\ntailored towards its customers’ unique workflow requirements. Where customers have pre-existing AI models or engines, the Company integrates those models or engines into\nits edge platform allowing customers to leverage proprietary models within the Airship AI software ecosystem.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s primary offerings include Outpost AI, Acropolis, and Airship Command. Its offerings allow customers to manage their data across the full data lifecycle, when\nand where they need it, using a highly secure permissioned based architecture.\nThe Company employed fifty one employees as of September 30, 2024. The employees are headquartered in Redmond, WA and are supported by a growing team at its\nCustomer Center of Excellence located in Charlotte, NC. The Company employed eight research and development personnel in Taiwan as of September 30, 2024.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nFor periods prior to the merger, the reported share and per share amounts have been retroactively converted by the applicable exchange ratio with the exception of the\nauthorized shares and shares reserved for issuance. See Note 11—Reverse Recapitalization for additional information.\nFunctional Currency\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company’s functional currency for U.S. operations is the U.S. Dollar. The operations of Zeppelin Worldwide, Inc.\nand its subsidiary, Zeppelin Taiwan, Ltd. (together “Zeppelin”) use the Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. At each period end, Zeppelin’s balance sheet is translated into\nU.S. Dollars based upon the period end exchange rate, while their statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars\nbased upon an average exchange rate during the period.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains\ncash balances at various financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company has not\nexperienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk for cash on deposit.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nThe Company primarily generates revenue from sales of systems and products and the related post contract support to customers. The Company’s primary systems and products\ninclude Outpost AI, Acropolis and Airship Command. To date, the majority of the Company’s product revenue that has been recognized consists primarily of a bundled offering\nof hardware and software which delivers on premise solutions to its customers. Separate limited software subscription services have been delivered to customers including those\ncustomers that are able to operate in a cloud based environment. The transaction price recognized as revenue represents the amount the Company expects to be entitled to and is\nprimarily comprised of product revenue, net of returns and variable consideration, including sales incentives provided to customers. Payment is typically due within 30 to 90\ncalendar days of the invoice date.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to\nbe entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the\ncontract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further\ndescribed below.\n9\nTable of Contents\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of the Company’s system offerings, Outpost AI, Acropolis and Airship Command. The Company recognizes product revenue at\na point in time when title transfers, when the products are shipped, or when control of the system is transferred to the customer, which usually is upon delivery of the system and\nwhen contractual performance obligations have been satisfied.\nPost Contract Support Revenue\nPost Contract Support (“PCS”) revenue is derived primarily from the Company’s support and software maintenance agreements (“SMA”). The Company’s PCS includes the\nright to receive, on a when and if available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features as well as bug fixes, and email and telephone support. The Company\nallocates a portion of the transaction price to the PCS performance obligation based on a cost-plus methodology and recognizes the associated revenue on a straight-line basis\nover the estimated term of the support period. The Company’s support contracts are typically one to five years with an average of four years, payment is due within 30 to 90\ncalendars days of the invoice date and may include options to renew. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $95,120\nand $60,367, respectively, related to one-year support contracts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $1,042,008 and\n$1,413,548, respectively, related to multi-year support contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $234,717 and\n$141,582, respectively, related to one-year support contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $3,083,464 and\n$3,536,003 respectively, related to multi-year support contracts.\nOther Services\nThe Company earns other service revenues from installation services, training and licensing which are short-term in nature and revenue for these services are recognized at the\ntime of performance when the service is provided.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s contracts with customers often contain multiple performance obligations that can include three separate obligations: (i) a hardware component (which may be\nbundled with hardware accessories) and the embedded firmware essential to the functionality of the hardware component delivered at the time of sale; (ii) the right to the\nCompany’s downloadable free application and software solutions, and (iii) the right for the customer to receive post contract support (“PCS”) after the initial sale. The\nCompany’s products and PCS offerings have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, the products are distinct from the Company’s PCS services as\ncustomers can benefit from the products without the PCS services and such PCS services are separately identifiable within the contracts. The Company accounts for multiple\nagreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in\neffect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance\nobligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nThe Company establishes the standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through\npast transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price based on its pricing model and offering type (products or PCS services).\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component as the Company’s standard payment terms are less than\none year.\nThe Company sells its products primarily through a direct sales force. The Company considers revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met:\n☐ The Company has a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,\n☐ Promised performance obligations are identified,\n☐ The transaction price, or the amount the Company expects to receive, is determinable and\n☐ The Company has satisfied the performance obligations to the customer.\n10\nTable of Contents\nTransfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless the Company is required to provide additional services.\nThe Company’s short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances totaled $3,326,543 and 3,585,344 as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s short-term and long-term\ndeferred revenue balances totaled $4,008,654 and $4,962,126 as of December 31, 2023. Of the deferred revenue balance of $8,970,780 as of January 1, 2024, the Company\nrecognized approximately $933,675 and $3,061,613 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable and Provision for Credit Losses\nThe Company generally sells its products to large governmental entities and large corporations in the United States. Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and\nare non-interest bearing.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (codified as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\n326) on January 1, 2023. ASC 326 adds to U.S. GAAP the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, a measurement model based on expected losses rather than incurred\nlosses. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, the Company evaluated receivables regularly and adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. The Company determined\nestimates of uncollectible accounts receivable based primarily on actual historical bad debt and sales return trends, customers financial condition and general economic\nconditions. Under the application of ASC 326, the Company’s historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as current\neconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. In developing its expected credit loss estimate, the Company\nevaluated the appropriate grouping of financial assets based upon its evaluation of risk characteristics, including consideration of the types of products and services sold.\nAccount balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered\nremote.\nOccasionally certain long-standing customers, who routinely place large orders, will have unusually large receivables balances relative to the total gross receivables.\nManagement monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices before shipping new sales orders. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have a reserve for credit losses as all accounts receivable are considered collectible. Accounts receivable balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1,121,862 and $1,648,904, respectively.\nConcentration of Credit and Sales Risk\nThe Company sells its product to commercial and government customers under agreements that are normally paid within 30 days of contract completion.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had revenue from sixty eight customers and one customer represented6 3% of total revenue, although such a high\nlevel of customer concentration is not typical. The primary reason for the high level of customer concentration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to one\nlarge order received in late 2023 which was fulfilled in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, five customers represent approximately 21%,\n20%, 16%, 12% and 11% of outstanding account receivables. Due to the nature of the customers and timely payment history, customer concentration and credit risk in account\nreceivables is estimated to be minimal.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, two customers represent approximately4 9% and 16% of total revenue. As of December 31, 2023, three customers represent\napproximately 51%, 26% and 17% of outstanding account receivables. Due to the nature of the customers and timely payment history, customer concentration and credit risk in\naccount receivables is estimated to be minimal.\n11\nTable of Contents\nInventory\nThe Company’s purchase of inventory, primarily computer servers, is undertaken to match purchase orders received from customers. Upon receipt of inventory, the Company\ngenerally configures the servers and loads proprietary software onto the servers before shipping out. The Company holds inventory for a short period of time and as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, it had no inventory in stock. Inventory value is primarily material costs and is valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out\nmethod) or net realizable value.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nLong-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future\nservice potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying\nvalues exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results. The Company recorded impairment losses of $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as\nmaterials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.\nThe Company’s current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving the Company’s products. The Company is also actively involved in identifying\nnew applications. The Company’s current internal team along with outside consultants has considerable experience working with the application of the Company’s technologies\nand their applications. The Company engages third party experts as required to supplement the Company’s internal team. The Company believes that continued development of\nnew and enhanced technologies is essential to the Company’s future success. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,073,735 and $688,798 for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on development activities. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $2,471,872 and\n$2,028,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on development activities.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts incurred in the development of software programs for the Company’s products are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility of the software has been\nestablished. Generally, technological feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary functions described in its original specifications, contains features\nrequired for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete. After technological feasibility is\nestablished, any additional costs are capitalized. Capitalization of software costs ceases when the software is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use. No\nsoftware development costs have been capitalized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nCost of Net Revenues\nCost of net revenues for products includes components and freight. Cost of net revenues for post contract support and other services includes primarily the cost of personnel and\npersonnel-related expenses to conduct implementations and ongoing client support.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 were $41,107 and $2,587, respectively. Advertising and marketing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $130,428 and $55,916,\nrespectively.\n12\nTable of Contents\nShipping and Handling of Products\nAmounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are included in net revenues. Costs incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost\nof revenues.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on\nobservable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an\nentity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 — Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and\naccrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are based upon the short-term nature of the\nassets and liabilities. The Company recorded its Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note, earnout liability (unvested earnout shares), and the warrants that were issued with\nthe Convertible Promissory Note at fair value, remeasured on a recurring basis and considered them as Level 3 instruments. The public and private warrants were considered\nLevel 1 and 2 instruments, respectively. The fair value of the vested earnout shares was considered a Level 1 instrument. The method of determining the fair value of the Senior\nSecured Convertible Promissory Note and attached warrants is described below.\nThe Company classifies as liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net- cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event\nis outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nAccounting for Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes at Fair Value\nThe Company has elected the fair value option to account for the senior secured convertible note that was issued on June 22, 2023 and the convertible notes that were issued in\nOctober and November 2023 with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As a result of applying the fair value\noption, direct costs and fees related to the convertible notes are recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred. Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that\nrequire inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair\nvalue measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the liability. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market\ndata and determine an estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair values. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has used a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model that factors in potential outcomes being consummated, such as the convertible notes being\nrepaid in cash and the convertible notes being converted to common stock. All of these scenarios take into consideration the terms and conditions of the underlying convertible\nnotes plus potential changes in the underlying value of the common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized an unrealized loss\nof $141,636 and $400,921 for the change in fair value of the notes and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company\nbelieves accounting for the convertible notes at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Liabilities and Earnout Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments,\nincluding issued share purchase warrants and earnout shares to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant\nto ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be\nrecorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company classifies as liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement\n(including a requirement to net- cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-\ncash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nAt the merger closing, the Company assumed 515,000 private placement warrants and 16,184,612 public warrants. On June 3, 2024, the Company permanently reduced the\nexercise price of such warrants from $11.50 per share to an exercise price of $7.80 per share. The purpose of this reduced exercise price was to potentially raise proceeds\nreceived from the exercise of such warrants, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were 515,000 private placement\nwarrants and 16,159,012 public warrants outstanding. See Note 12– Private Placement and Public Warrants for more information.\nUpon consummation of the merger, the Company evaluated the warrants and concluded that they did not meet the criteria to be classified within the stockholders’ deficit.\nAccordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The initial estimated\nfair value of the warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The subsequent estimated fair value of the public warrants is based on the listed price in an active\nmarket for such warrants while the fair value of the private placement warrants continues to be measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with the key inputs being directly or\nindirectly observable public warrants listed price. Since the public and private warrants meet the definition of a derivative, the Company recorded the public and private\nwarrants as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value upon the merger closing, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of operations at each reporting date.\nAt the closing of the merger, the Airship AI securityholders that hold shares of common stock of Airship AI, Airship AI options, Airship AI earnout warrants or Airship AI\nSARs have the contingent right to receive up to 5.0 million additional shares of common stock, subject to certain contingencies. These earnout shares have been categorized\ninto two components: (i) the vested shares that are associated with stockholders with vested equity at the closing of the merger that will be earned upon achievement of the\nearnout milestones and (ii) the unvested shares associated with stockholders with unvested equity at the closing of the merger that will be earned over the remaining service\nperiod with the Company on their unvested equity shares and upon achievement of the earnout milestones.\nThe earnout shares associated with vested shares are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40, as the events that determine the number of earnout\nshares required to be released or issued, as the case may be, include events that were not solely indexed to the fair value of common stock of the Company. The earnout shares\nwere measured at the merger closing and subsequently measured at each reporting date until settled or when they met the criteria for equity classification. Accordingly, the\nCompany recognizes the earnout shares as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The earnout shares were valued using a\nMonte Carlo analysis.\nAt the closing of the merger, the unvested earnout shares were considered to be equity instruments and valued at approximately $2,675,000. This amount will be recognized as\nstock-based compensation going forward over the five-year vesting period.\nDerivative warrant and earnout shares liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of significant current\nassets or require the creation of current liabilities.\n14\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, stock appreciation rights,\nincentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, unvested earnout shares and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant.\nStock-based compensation cost is measured by the Company at the grant date and the fair value of the award is recognized as an expense, over the requisite service period which\nis generally the vesting period. The Company adjusts stock-based compensation for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture\nexperience. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The\nCompany’s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends upon future taxable income, as well as the limitations discussed below. For financial reporting purposes, a deferred tax\nasset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration. The\nCompany considers historical and future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for valuation.\nComprehensive Gain\nComprehensive gain is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. There was other comprehensive gain of $354 and loss of $2,410\nrelated foreign exchange translation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was other comprehensive gain of $9,338 and gain of $40,141\nrelated foreign exchange translation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 (“ASC 205-40”), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\nwhich the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern\nuncertainties in their consolidated financial statements. ASC 205-40 requires management to perform assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within\none year of the date of issuance of the entity’s consolidated financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the consolidated financial statements are available to\nbe issued, when applicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is “substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” and\nmanagement plans to alleviate the going concern. In November 2024, the Company analyzed its cash requirements and operations at least through November 2025 and has\ndetermined that, based upon the Company’s current available cash and operations, the Company has no substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements relate to the calculation of revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, valuation of common stock, valuation of senior secured convertible notes,\nwarrant liability, earnout share liabilities, accruals for potential liabilities including income taxes, valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation assumptions related to share-\nbased compensation.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is based upon the net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 divided by the weighted average shares of\ncommon stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the\ndilutive effect of stock options, warrants, convertible notes payable and stock appreciation rights) outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. Common stock equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nnot included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share given the Company incurred a loss and they are anti-dilutive. See Note 15—Earnings per share.\nReportable Segments\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected\ninformation about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and\nservices the Company offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is\ndeveloped each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAll recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not or are\nnot believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.\n3. Advances due to and from Founders\nAdvances due to Founders\nPrior to 2023, the founders had advanced the Company a net $600,000. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI a total of $1,350,000\nand were repaid a total of $200,000, with $1,750,000 recorded as advances from founders as of December 31, 2023. During 2024, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI\n$2,100,000 and were repaid $2,100,000, with $1,750,000 recorded as advances from founders as of September 30, 2024. The outstanding advances as of September 30, 2024\nare non-interest bearing and the Company expects to pay the balance off within a one year period.\nMaster Loan Agreement\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company entered into a Master Loan Agreement with Mr. Huang, whereby he may provide additional funding of up to $1,500,000 under certain\nterms and conditions. The Agreement provides for interest of 6%. The Company agreed to pay interest for the 2024 advances (described under Advances to Founders above) of\n$11,913 and issued warrants to purchase up to 220,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.36 per share, are exercisable immediately upon\nissuance and will expire in five years following the date of issuance. The $284,478 fair value of the warrant is recorded in permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets\nand was fully expensed on the date of grant. There are no outstanding advances under this Master Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\n4. Revenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company’s net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of approximately $16.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of hardware and\nsoftware bundled systems for which revenue is transferred at a point in time The Company’s remaining net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of\napproximately $3.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, related to PCS revenue and other services which are transferred over time. Within each product category, contract\nterms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flow are substantially similar.\n16\nTable of Contents\nContract Balances\nA receivable is recognized in the period the Company delivers goods or provides services or when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. The Company usually\ndoes not record contract assets because the Company has an unconditional right to payment upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, and therefore, a receivable is more\ncommonly recorded than a contract asset. Receivables are generally paid within thirty days and there is no financing element to the customer contracts. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no unbilled receivable balances.\nThe Company’s short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances totaled $3,326,543 and $3,585,344 as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s short-term and long-term\ndeferred revenue balances totaled $4,008,654 and $4,962,126 as of December 31, 2023. Of the deferred revenue balance of $8,970,780 as of January 1, 2024, the Company\nrecognized approximately $933,675 and $3,061,613 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $6.9 million of remaining performance obligations, which were comprised of deferred service contracts not yet\ndelivered. The Company expects to recognize approximately 15% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2024 and the remaining 85% in fiscal 2025\nand years thereafter.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company does not pay any material variable compensation to obtain a customer contract. Additionally, the majority of the Company’s cost of fulfillment as a seller of\nproducts is classified as inventory and then cost of revenue when the product is sold. Other costs of contract fulfillment such as software maintenance are expensed in the period\nincurred and align with when the revenue is amortized.\n5. Notes Payable and Convertible Notes Payable\nOn June 22, 2023, the Company issued a $2,000,000 senior secured convertible promissory note to Platinum Capital Partners, Inc.\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company issued an amended and restated senior secured convertible promissory note to Platinum in the principal amount of $2,000,000. Interest\naccrued on the Platinum convertible note at the rate of 6% per annum calculated on the basis of 360 days. At the option of Platinum, the $2,000,000 principal amount of the note\nplus any accrued but unpaid interest is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price per share equal to the lower of (i) $3.69717, subject to\nappropriate adjustment as provided in the note, and (ii) 65% of the VWAP of the common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to any conversion, but in no event\nbelow $2.27518, subject to appropriate adjustment as provided in the note. The note contains “weighted average” anti-dilution protection for issuances of shares of common\nstock or common stock equivalents at a price less than the conversion price then in effect.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Platinum convertible note, the Company issued to Platinum an amended and restated common stock purchase warrant dated February 2,\n2024, to purchase 189,334 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price per share of $3.69717. On March 18, 2024, Platinum exercised the Platinum warrant and\nreceived 137,367 shares of common stock. Platinum forfeited 51,967 shares.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOn June 22, 2024, the Company entered into an extension agreement related to the Platinum convertible note. The extension agreement extended the due date of the note to June\n22, 2025. In consideration for entering into the extension agreement, the Company issued to Platinum 232,360 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock in payment of\nall interest and extension fees through June 22, 2025 with a value of $1,008,400. Approximately $487,000 of the total payment related to the future interest periods and were\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and others on the consolidated balance sheet. Subject to the terms and conditions of such extension agreement, for a period commencing on\nDecember 22, 2024 and ending at the close of business on December 22, 2025, Platinum has a one-time put right to have the Company purchase all or a portion of Platinum’s\n232,360 restricted shares at $2.27518 per share. The Company granted piggyback registration rights to Platinum.\nThe obligations under the Platinum convertible note are secured by a blanket lien on all assets of the Company pursuant to an Amended and Restated Security Agreement dated\nFebruary 2, 2024 and are guaranteed pursuant to an Amended and Restated Guaranty dated February 2, 2024. The Company also concurrently entered into an Amended and\nRestated Subordination Agreement.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 219,763 shares of common stock related to the conversion of $500,000 of the Platinum convertible\nnote and recorded a loss on note conversion of $200,338.\nOn October 3, 2023, the Company issued senior secured convertible promissory notes for $600,000 to two private investors. At the option of the holders, the notes were\nconvertible into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock.

Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently not a party to any\npending legal proceeding that is not ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.\nProperties and Operating Leases-Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability\nLease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842,L eases. Right of use lease assets and lease liabilities\nare recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The incremental borrowing taking into\nconsideration the Company’s credit quality and borrowing rate for similar assets is used in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense is recorded as\ngeneral and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nOn July 13, 2023, the Company entered into a lease in Redmond, WA for 15,567 square feet of office and warehouse space which started October 1, 2023. The monthly\npayment is $25,000 per month. The lease expires October 31, 2027 and the monthly payment increases 3% on July 31, 2024 and each year thereafter. There is a one three year\noption to extend the lease based on the fair market rate on October 31, 2027, which the Company expects to exercise.\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company extended an office lease in Moorestown, North Carolina. The Company leases3 ,621 square feet and the net monthly payment is $6,488.\nOn August 27, 2024, the Company extended the lease to February 28, 2025.\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for office and development facilities for four years and include options to renew. The Company determines whether an\narrangement is or contains a lease based upon the unique facts and circumstances at the inception of the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use\nassets are recorded based upon the present value of the lease payments over the expected lease term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total operating lease\nliabilities was $986,053 and $1,118,578, respectively. Right of use assets was $929,890 and $1,104,804 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Current\nlease liabilities were $267,660 and $174,876 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany recognized $88,428 and $162,414 in total lease costs for the leases, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized\n$265,283 and $487,242 in total lease costs for the leases, respectively. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its estimated\nincremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for the operating leases was thirty seven months at September 30, 2024 and the weighted average discount rate was7 %.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe minimum future lease payments as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nYears Ended September 30,\n2025 $ 327,308\n2026 367,606\n2027 378,646\n2028 32,333\nTotal remaining payments 1,105,893\nLess Imputed Interest (119,840)\nTotal lease liability $ 986,053\nEmployment Agreement\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mark E. Scott, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, which provides for a base salary of\n$250,000 annually. Mr. Scott is also eligible to participate in annual performance-based bonus programs established by the board or compensation committee, subject to the\nachievement of applicable performance criteria established by the board or compensation committee, which shall be determined in good faith by the board or compensation\ncommittee.

Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax\nrate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily related to the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets.\nFor interim periods, the Company estimates its annual effective income tax rate and applies the estimated rate to the year-to-date income or loss before income taxes. The\nCompany also computes the tax provision or benefit related to items reported separately and recognizes the items net of their related tax effect in the interim periods in which\nthey occur. The Company also recognizes the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates in the interim periods in which the changes occur.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company retains a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. The realization of the Company’s deferred tax\nassets depends primarily on its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable in future periods may change as\nmanagement continues to reassess the underlying factors it uses in estimating future taxable income.\n11. Reverse Recapitalization\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company completed the merger and received net proceeds of $2.8 million, net of transaction costs of $6.6 million.\nThe merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, BYTS, who was the legal acquirer, was treated as the\n“acquired” company for accounting purposes and Airship AI was treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the merger was treated as the equivalent of Airship AI issuing\nshares at the closing of the merger for the net assets of BYTS as of the closing date, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BYTS was stated at historical cost, with\nno goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Airship AI was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances:\n☐ Airship AI’s stockholders have the majority voting interest in the combined company;\n☐ The board of the post-merger company is composed of one (1) director designated by BYTS and four (4) directors designated by Airship AI;\n☐ Airship AI’s senior management is the senior management of the post-merger company;\n☐ The business of Airship AI comprises the ongoing operations of post-merger company; and\n☐ Airship AI is the larger entity, in terms of substantive assets.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the shares of common stock issued immediately after the closing of the merger as well as the impact on the consolidated statement of stockholders’\nequity as of December 21, 2023:\nAdditional Accumulated\nShares Par Amount Common Stock Paid in Capital Deficit\nSPAC Financing 8,891,718 $ 0.0001 $ 889 $ 8,315,186 $ -\nTransaction expenses (1) 532,986 0.0001 53 (6,651,674) (894,662)\nEarnout liability (4,470,918) (22,638,859)\nWarrants liability (2,009,105) -\nReverse capitalization on December 21, 2023 (1) 9,424,704 $ 942 $ (4,816,511) $ (23,533,521)\n(1) Adjusted for correction of transaction expense discussed below.\nImmaterial Revision of Prior Period Financial Information\nIn connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, the Company identified an immaterial error related to the classification of prepaid expenses and\ntransaction expenses (classified in accumulated deficit as reverse recapitalization). In accordance with SAB No. 99, “Materiality,” and SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects\nof Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements,” the Company evaluated the error and determined that the impact was\nnot material to its financial statements for the prior annual and current interim period, accordingly the Company revised the prior period financial information for comparative\npurposes. The revision does not impact the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. A summary of the revision to the Company’s previously reported\nconsolidated balance sheets is included below for comparative purposes:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAs Reported Adjustment As Revised\nPrepaid expenses and other $ 913,030 $ (894,662) $ 18,368\nTotal current assets 5,693,577 (894,662) 4,798,915\nTotal assets 6,982,575 (894,662) 6,087,913\nAccumulated deficit (16,582,038) (894,662) (17,476,700)\nTotal stockholders' deficit (16,592,565) (894,662) (17,487,227)\nThe revision had no impact to cash provided by operating activities in such period.\n12.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any earnout shares that are not earned by Airship AI securityholder in respect of its options or SARs on or before the fifth anniversary of\nthe closing date of the merger shall be forfeited without any consideration. Any earnout shares that are forfeited pursuant to the merger agreement shall be reallocated to the\nother Airship AI securityholders who remain entitled to receive earnout shares in accordance with their respective earnout pro rata shares.\nThese earnout shares have been categorized into two components: (i) the “Vested Shares” - those associated with earnout holders with vested equity at the closing of the merger\nthat will be earned upon achievement of the earnout milestones and (ii) the “Unvested Shares” - those associated with earnout holders with unvested equity at the closing of the\nmerger that will be earned over the remaining service period with the Company on their unvested equity shares and upon achievement of the earnout milestones. The Vested\nShares, which represent 95% of the total earnout shares are classified as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the\nconsolidated statements of operations due to the variability in the number of earnout shares at settlement which could change upon a change of control event. The earnout\narrangement contains a settlement provision that violates the indexation guidance under ASC 815-40. The Unvested Shares are equity-classified share-based compensation to be\nrecognized over time under ASC 718 due to the service component.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAt the closing of the merger on December 21, 2023, the earnout liability had an initial fair value of $27,109,777, which was recorded as a long-term liability and a reduction to\nadditional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the earnout liability had decreased to $5,133,428 as a result of the decline in the\nCompany’s share price since the closing of the merger. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the earnout liability increased to $6,229,390 primarily due to the\nincrease in the Company’s share price, which resulted in a gain (loss) due to the change in fair value of the earnout liability during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 of $5,511,961 and $(1,095,962), respectively, and is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 14– Fair Value\nMeasurements for more information.\nIn addition, a portion of the earnout shares may be issued to individuals with unvested equity awards. While the payout of these shares requires the achievement of the earnout\nmilestones, the individuals must complete the remaining service period associated with these unvested equity awards to be eligible to receive the earnout shares. As a result,\nthese unvested earn-out shares are equity-classified awards and have an aggregated grant date fair value of $2,675,223 (or $5.96 per share). During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company stock-based compensation expense for the vesting of earnout shares was $133,761 and $401,283, respectively. As of September 30,\n2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested earnout shares totaled $2,273,941. The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation cost is\nexpected to be recognized is 4.25 years.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company determined the First Operating Performance Milestone (A,2) is achieved and1 ,250,000 shares are to be issued to applicable personnel\nin early January 2025. The fair value of the 1,250,000 vested shares as of September 30, 2024 of $2,875,000 was determined using the Company’s closing trading price on\nSeptember 30, 2024 and is included in the earnout liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The vested earnout shares are considered a level 1 fair value instrument. See Note\n14.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table sets forth by level within the ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value hierarchy of the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities-\nEarnout liability $ 2,875,000 $ - $ 3,354,390 $ 6,229,390\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes - - 1,793,360 1,793,360\nWarrant liability (Public Warrants) 3,393,393 - - 3,393,393\nWarrant liability (Private Warrants) - 108,150 - 108,150\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 6,268,393 $ 108,150 $ 5,147,750 $ 11,524,293\nThe following table sets forth by level within the ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value hierarchy of the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities\nEarnout liability $ - $ - $ 5,133,428 $ 5,133,428\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes - - 2,825,366 2,825,366\nWarrant liability (Public Warrants) 646,428 - - 646,428\nWarrant liability (Private Warrants) - 21,557 - 21,557\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 646,428 $ 21,557 $ 7,958,794 $ 8,626,779\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated fair value of the earnout liability was determined using a Monte Carlo Model. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain\nstock price milestones including projected stock price, volatility, probability of meeting the federal law enforcement agency growth and risk-free rate. The following\nassumptions were used in the simulation at each valuation date:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nStock price $ 2.30 $ 1.70\nRisk-free interest rate 3.58% 3.84%\nExpected term (in years) 4.3 5\nExpected volatility 60.4% 75.9%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nThe assumptions also included the probability of meeting the federal law enforcement agency growth milestone at 100%. The fair value of the1 ,250,000 vested shares as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 of $2,875,000 was determined using the Company’s closing trading price on September 30, 2024.\nThe initial estimated fair value of the private warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value of the public warrants is based on the listed price\nin an active market for such warrants and the fair value of the private placement warrants continues to be measured based on the public warrants listed price.\nThe estimated fair value of the senior secured convertible promissory notes was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model that factors in potential outcomes being\nconsummated, such as the convertible notes being repaid in cash and the convertible notes being converted to common stock. All of these scenarios take into consideration the\nterms and conditions of the underlying convertible notes plus potential changes in the underlying value of the common stock. The following assumptions were used in the\nsimulation:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nStock price $ 2.30 1.70\nEffective discount rate 12.28% 12.95%\nExpected term (in years) 0.73 0.48 to 0.75\nExpected volatility 55.0% 62.5%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nOn September 13, 2024, the vested earnout shares were transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 upon the Board approval of the achievement of the First Operating Performance\nMilestone (A,2). The fair value on the day of transfer was $3,400,000. There were no transfers of financial instruments between valuation levels during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The changes in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nLevel 3\nBeginning Ending Balance\nBalance Unrealized and Conversions / Transfers out as of\nSeptember 30,\nJanuary 1, 2024 Realized Loss Settlements (a) of Level 3 2024\nLiabilities-\nEarnout liability $ 5,133,428 $ 1,620,962 $ - $ (3,400,000) $ 3,354,390\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes 2,825,366 735,227 (1,767,233) - 1,793,360\n$ 7,958,794 $ 2,356,189 $ (1,767,233) $ (3,400,000) $ 5,147,750\n(a) The conversions and settlements represent the fair value of the Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes at the dates of conversion.\n28\nTable of Contents\n15.

The 1,250,000 vested earnout shares are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation\nfor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and will be issued to applicable personnel in early January 2025.\nAs a result of the merger, the weighted-average number of shares of common stock used in the calculation of net income (loss) per share have been retroactively converted by\napplying the conversion ratio.\n16. Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events, for the purpose of adjustment or disclosure, up through the date the financial statements were issued. Subsequent to September 30,\n2024, there were the following material transaction that occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements:\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company issued 109,881 shares of common stock related to the conversion of the Platinum convertible note. This issuance was made pursuant to\nthe exemption from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2).\nOn November 13, 2024, the Company issued 219,763 shares of common stock related to the conversion of the Platinum convertible note. This issuance was made pursuant to\nthe exemption from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2).\n29\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods\npresented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this\nreport. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available\nto, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed\nbelow and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nWe are a robust AI-driven data management platform that solves complex data challenges for large institutions operating in dynamic and mission-critical environments with\nrapidly increasing volumes of data being ingested from a similarly rapidly growing number of data sources.\nWe solve these challenges by structuring “dark” or unstructured data at the edge, the location at which the data is generated and collected, and leveraging purpose-built AI\nmodels. Unstructured, or “dark” data, which is typically categorized as qualitative data, cannot be processed and analyzed via conventional data tools and methods. Conversely,\nstructured data, typically categorized as quantitative data, is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms.\nStructuring and then analyzing data using AI models at the edge, versus transmitting the data from the edge back to a central processing location for structuring and analysis,\nenables real-time decision making and data-driven operational efficiency.\nWe specialize in ingesting all available metadata from edge-based sensors used by government and law enforcement agencies around the world, including surveillance cameras\n(video), audio, telemetry, acoustic, seismic, and autonomous devices, along with large commercial corporations with fundamentally similar capabilities and requirements.\nData generated by these edge-based sensors, including video, can then be run through our trained AI models to detect objects present within the video frame. Once an object is\ndetected, for example an automobile, additional identifying characteristics of the object can be extracted from the image including the license plate characters and the make,\nmodel, and color of the automobile. This process of analyzing, logging and categorizing ingested data is referred to as “structuring” the data.\nAirship AI’s software allows customers to view structured data both in real-time as well as to conduct searches on the structured data at a later point in time. Real-time\nstructured data use includes, for example, alarms on a specific license plate or a specific make, model or color of automobile. Non-real-time structured data use includes, for\nexample, searching a database of video data that has been previously ingested and stored to find instances of a particular license plate being visible, along with other logged\nvehicle characteristics such as make, model and color of an automobile.\nAdditional edge deployed AI models enable similar object detection and recognition of common and custom trained objects, such as an aircraft, boat, person, animal, bag, or\nweapon. Airship AI’s models provide similar data points for these object types allowing analysts the ability to be notified in real-time of the detection of a specified object and\nsimilarly search for historically detected objects. Examples include detecting aircrafts and boats along with their respective tail numbers and hull registration numbers.\nOur AI modelling process starts with pre-trained AI models from our technology ecosystem partners which we then customize using proprietary datasets tailored towards our\ncustomers unique workflow requirements. Where customers have pre-existing AI models or engines, we integrate those models or engines into our edge platform allowing\ncustomers to leverage proprietary models within the Airship AI software ecosystem.\nOur primary offerings include Outpost AI, Acropolis, and Airship Command. Our offerings allow customers to manage their data across the full data lifecycle, when and where\nthey need it, using a highly secure permissioned based architecture.\nRecent Developments\nOn June 3, 2024, we permanently reduced the exercise price of our outstanding 16,184,612 public warrants and 515,000 private warrants, previously exercisable at $11.50 per\nshare, to an exercise price of $7.80 per share. The purpose of this reduced exercise price was to potentially raise proceeds received from the exercise of such warrants, if any, for\nworking capital and general corporate purposes.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOn June 22, 2024, we entered into an extension agreement with Platinum Capital Partner, Inc. to extend the maturity date of a $2,000,000 senior secured convertible promissory\nnote to June 22, 2025. In consideration for entering into the extension agreement, we issued to Platinum 232,360 shares of common stock in payment of all interest and\nextension fees through June 22, 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 219,763 shares of common stock related to the conversion of\n$500,000 of the senior secured convertible note.\nOn September 3, 2024, we closed an offering of $8 million of shares of common stock and common stock purchase warrants and received net proceeds of approximately $7.3\nmillion, after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us, including the placement agent fees. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working\ncapital and general corporate purposes, including cost of goods sold purchases, personnel and product development.\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company entered into a Master Loan Agreement with Mr. Huang, whereby he may provide additional funding of up to $1,500,000 under certain\nterms and conditions. The agreement provides for interest of 6%. The Company agreed to pay interest for the 2024 advances of $11,913 and issued warrants to purchase up to\n220,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.36 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire in five years following the\ndate of issuance. There are no outstanding advances under this Master Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\nFair Value Transactions\nAs a result of the merger, we entered into the following transactions that were measured at fair value and vary quarterly with the share price and other items. Any change is non-\ncash and is recorded as a gain or loss in other income (expense). See Note 14– Fair Value Measurements for more information.\nLiability as of Liability as of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nEarnout liability $ 6,229,390 $ 5,133,428\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes 1,793,360 2,825,366\nWarrant liability (Public Warrants) 3,393,393 646,428\nWarrant liability (Private Warrants) 108,150 21,557\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 11,524,293 $ 8,626,779\nOther loss related to instruments recorded at fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 $ (4,071,156) $ (400,921)\nPrivate Placement and Public Warrants\nAt the merger closing, we assumed 515,000 private placement warrants and 16,184,612 public warrants. On June 3, 2024, we permanently reduced the exercise price of such\nwarrants from $11.50 per share to an exercise price of $7.80 per share. The purpose of this reduced exercise price was to potentially raise proceeds received from the exercise of\nsuch warrants, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were 515,000 private placement warrants and 16,159,012 public\nwarrants outstanding.\nKey Performance Indicators\nHistorically, a majority of our product revenue has consisted primarily of a bundled hardware and software product and to date we have sold or licensed a minimal amount of\nstandalone software. In the future, we expect to see more delivery of our products using a cloud based software solution which will allow us to create additional subscription\nrevenue.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe have historically evaluated our business solely based on revenue generated from customers and we have not tracked any other customer-related metrics. As we grow and\nincrease our product offerings and customer base, we intend to modify and develop more advanced performance indicators. We believe the following key performance\nindicators apply to us in the future:\n☐ Growth within existing government customers. While we currently have a strong footprint across multiple large U.S. government agencies, growing our business\nwithin these agencies outside of the investigation focused departments is a fundamental area of our projected growth. Our ability to expand our footprint by\nimplementing AI based solutions that leverage our core existing competencies within the agencies will be a critical indicator of the success of this strategy. We\nwill measure progress against this objective through the disclosure of awards for new business within these agencies during the affected timeframe, providing\ntangible evidence of the success of our strategy to both management and investors alike.\n☐ Greater penetration into the commercial marketplace. While we have several existing customers in the commercial marketplace, our ability to build on the\nsolutions we provide those customers and expand that base will be critical to our projected growth objectives. We will measure progress against this objective\nthrough the disclosure of the number of new commercial customers added during the affected timeframe, providing tangible evidence of the success of our\nstrategy to both management and investors alike.\n☐ Expansion of our edge AI based solutions. We began to sell AI based solutions in late 2022. Our current strategy is highly focused on the transition of data\nmanagement and analysis workloads to the edge, driving efficiency and cost savings for our customers. This strategy also includes new models being trained to\nextract data at the edge which enables real-time intelligent decision making for our customers. We will measure progress against this objective through the\ndisclosure of the numbers of edge AI hardware devices we are selling as well as the growth of our edge AI analytic capabilities, providing tangible evidence of the\nsuccess of our strategy to both management and investors alike.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following factors and trends may cause previously reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial\nconditions:\n☐ Increase in the sales of lower margin solutions as we expand our operational footprint. While our current focus remains on expanding our AI driven software\napplication portfolio, opportunities will continue to present themselves to provide those software-based solutions as part of a larger hardware-based turn-key\nsolutions where Airship AI can provide a unique value-add to the customer. While these solutions will positively affect revenue we anticipate our operating profits\nin future periods may be adversely affected as compared to previous years due to the lower operating margin for hardware versus software applications.\n☐ Challenges due to geo-political driven supply-chain constraints. While many of the COVID-19 driven supply chain issues have been resolved, challenges to the\ntimely production and delivery of Taiwan based products we utilize for our edge AI platform due to geo-political factors is a concern looking forward. In the\nevent that our suppliers are unable to provide timely delivery of those supplies it will significantly impact our ability to meet delivery schedules for existing and\nanticipated edge AI hardware-based solutions.\n☐ Near-term impacts due to merger and acquisition activity. If Airship AI merges with or acquires another company, it is reasonably expected that there will be\nincreased operating expenses and costs associated with the merger that could negatively impact operating profits in the future periods immediately following the\nM&A event. The extent and longevity of those impacts is not possible to quantify.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected\ninformation about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and\nservices the Company offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is\ndeveloped each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss to the consolidated financial statements.\n32\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Variance % Variance\nNet revenues $ 2,868 $ 2,384 $ 484 20.3%\nCost of net revenues 714 782 68 8.7%\nGross profit 2,154 1,602 552 34.5%\nResearch and development expenses 1,074 689 (385) -55.9%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,667 2,142 (525) -24.5%\nTotal operating expenses 3,741 2,831 (910) -32.1%\nOperating loss (1,587) (1,229) (358) -29.1%\nOther income (expense):\nGain from change in fair value of earnout liability 5,512 - 5,512 100.0%\nGain from change in fair value of warrant liability 2,471 - 2,471 100.0%\nGain (loss) from change in fair value of convertible debt 371 (401) 772 -192.5%\nLoss on note conversion (435) - (435) -100.0%\nInterest expense, net (134) (39) (95) -243.6%\nOther income (expense) 16 2 14 -700.0%\nTotal other income (expense), net 7,801 (438) 8,239 1881.1%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 6,214 (1,667) 7,881 472.8%\nProvision for income taxes - - - -\nNet income (loss) $ 6,214 $ (1,667) $ 7,881 472.8%\nNet Revenues — Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $484,000 to $2,868,000 as compared to $2,384,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as a result of increased product sales. We received purchase orders from various federal government agency customers totaling over $16 million from\nwhich we partially shipped in the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nCost of Net Revenues — Cost of net revenues primarily consists of product costs and post customer support. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales\ndecreased $68,000 to $714,000 as compared to $782,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to reduced equipment purchases and increased\nOutpost AI sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and Development Expenses — Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $385,000 to $1,074,000 as compared to\n$689,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could\ndiffer materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe that the significant accounting policies described in “Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements are\naccurate and complete.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange\nAct”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nb) Inherent Limitations on Internal controls\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be\nmet. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.\nc) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, which were identified in connection with our\nmanagement’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material effect\non our internal control over financial reporting.\n37\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nITEM 1.

BUSINESS.\nHistory\nThe Company has been in business since 2003 and on December 21, 2023, the Company completed the merger (the “Merger”) contemplated by the Merger Agreement, dated as\nof June 27, 2023 (as amended on September 22, 2023 and as may be further amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among BYTS, BYTE\nMerger Sub, Inc., a Washington corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BYTS (“Merger Sub”), and Airship AI. Effective December 21, 2023, following the\nfiling of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington, Merger Sub merged with and into Airship AI with Airship AI as the surviving corporation.\nThus, Airship AI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, Airship AI changed its name to “Airship AI, Inc.” On December 21,\n2023, our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and public warrants formerly of Byte, began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols “AISP” and\n“AISPW”, respectively.\nOverview\nWe are a robust AI-driven data management platform that solves complex data challenges for large institutions operating in dynamic and mission-critical environments with\nrapidly increasing volumes of data being ingested from a similarly rapidly growing number of data sources.\nWe solve these challenges by structuring “dark” or unstructured data at the edge, the location at which the data is generated and collected, and leveraging purpose-built AI\nmodels. Unstructured, or “dark” data, which is typically categorized as qualitative data, cannot be processed and analyzed via conventional data tools and methods. Conversely,\nstructured data, typically categorized as quantitative data, is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms.\nStructuring and then analyzing data using AI models at the edge, versus transmitting the data from the edge back to a central processing location for structuring and analysis,\nenables real-time decision making and data-driven operational efficiency.\nWe specialize in ingesting all available metadata from edge-based sensors used by government and law enforcement agencies around the world, including surveillance cameras\n(video), audio, telemetry, acoustic, seismic, and autonomous devices, along with large commercial corporations with fundamentally similar capabilities and requirements.\nData generated by these edge-based sensors, including video, can then be run through our trained AI models to detect objects present within the video frame. Once an object is\ndetected, for example an automobile, additional identifying characteristics of the object can be extracted from the image including the license plate characters and the make,\nmodel, and color of the automobile. This process of analyzing, logging and categorizing ingested data is referred to as “structuring” the data.\nAirship AI’s software allows customers to view structured data both in real-time as well as to conduct searches on the structured data at a later point in time. Real-time\nstructured data use includes, for example, alarms on a specific license plate or a specific make, model or color of automobile. Non-real-time structured data use includes, for\nexample, searching a database of video data that has been previously ingested and stored to find instances of a particular license plate being visible, along with other logged\nvehicle characteristics such as make, model and color of an automobile.\nAdditional edge deployed AI models enable similar object detection and recognition of common and custom trained objects, such as an aircraft, boat, person, animal, bag, or\nweapon. Airship AI’s models provide similar data points for these object types allowing analysts the ability to be notified in real-time of the detection of a specified object and\nsimilarly search for historically detected objects. Examples include detecting aircrafts and boats along with their respective tail numbers and hull registration numbers.\nOur AI modelling process starts with pre-trained AI models from our technology ecosystem partners which we then customize using proprietary datasets tailored towards our\ncustomers unique workflow requirements. Where customers have pre-existing AI models or engines, we integrate those models or engines into our edge platform allowing\ncustomers to leverage proprietary models within the Airship AI software ecosystem.\nOur primary offerings include Outpost AI, Acropolis, and Airship Command. Our offerings allow customers to manage their data across the full data lifecycle, when and where\nthey need it, using a highly secure permissioned based architecture.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOutpost AI is our edge hardware and software offering that is purpose built to structure and analyze data efficiently and effectively at the source using Airship AI trained\nmodels. Once structured, Outpost AI securely encodes the data and streams it to Acropolis for further processing. In the automobile example, Outpost AI will process the\nunstructured and unlabeled video data into structured data including images of vehicles, images of plates, make, model, color, locations and plate numbers, as well as\nconfidence levels on the structured results.\nAcropolis is our enterprise management software suite which serves as the backbone of our software ecosystem. Acropolis allows customers with a handful of devices or\nhundreds of thousands of devices to manage their user and install base efficiently and securely from a single graphical user interface. Acropolis can be installed and managed\nlocally (on-premises) as well as in cloud/multi-cloud-based system architectures. Acropolis can work with structured and unstructured data. In the scenario where Outpost AI\nprocesses the unstructured video of vehicles into images, plate numbers and other structured data, Acropolis will compare the structured data against customer repositories of\nstructured data in order to add labels to results for user attention. Here, Acropolis leaves the initial processing of unstructured data to the edge device (Outpost AI) and handles\nadditional labeling which requires bigger centralized datasets. Where Acropolis is receiving unstructured data as input from devices, it will do the initial processing of\nunstructured to structured data similar to what Outpost AI does at the edge before any additional labelling. This holistic approach allows customers to leverage the benefits of\nboth edge and back-end data structuring and analysis in a “single-pane-of-glass” approach.\nAirship Command then allows the customer to view the final labelled data which can be presented in real-time or as search results, as alerts, in automatically updating lists or on\nmaps. In the vehicle example, Airship Command can present alarms on specific filters such as specific plates, intelligent partial matches, make, model, color and any\ncombination thereof, as well as searches using the same filters against character recognition and vehicle characteristics results.\nAirship Command is our suite of visualization tools that allow customers to interact with their data and devices securely and efficiently. Customer data interaction may include\nreceiving and viewing an alarm triggered by an AI detected event at the edge on a mobile phone, or receiving and viewing events from thousands of edge devices spread across\nmultiple different locations on a large video wall in a Security Operations Center (“SOC”). Our visualization tools span applications for workstations, web-based browsers, and\napplications for mobile handheld devices ensuring our customers data is never out of their immediate reach.\nWe apply AI across the entire offering suite, ensuring that we are extracting as much value from our customers’ existing and emerging data as possible. Whether it is using\nmachine learning to train new models for deployment at the edge, or using a rules-based approach to detect anomalies based on data generated by machine learning models, we\nare constantly expanding and evolving our AI capabilities.\nOur offerings are used by some of the largest government agencies and commercial organizations in the world. While we are heavily focused on continuing to grow market\nshare in the United States, our offerings are currently deployed around the world, with significant room to grow in both the governmental and commercial markets.\nOur typical customer engagement is a multi-year contractual agreement, an agreement which includes our core offerings as well as professional services, technical support, and\nsoftware maintenance, which we expect will result in predictable, long-term recurring revenue. Our history shows that organizations that have chosen to partner with Airship AI\nstick with Airship AI.\nSince our inception and until the Merger in December 2023, we have operated as a 100% employee-owned bootstrapped company with no outside investment, operating in a\nfiscally conservative model. As a U.S. based company, we operate in high growth areas, namely the intersection of public safety and AI, with a combined $7 billion edge AI\nhardware and software addressable market.\nOur customers trust us to collect and analyze vast amounts of data in real-time as well as make it available to their users when they need it, where they need it, as securely as\npossible. We believe our offerings are purpose built from the ground up to help ensure we continue to meet or exceed these expectations.\nOur Industry\nWe believe a robust digital transformation strategy is imperative today for companies to discover new revenue opportunities, gain competitive advantages, and create efficient\nbusiness operations. Whether companies are established brick and mortar operations with large disparate operational footprints and user bases or newer entrants to the\nmarketplace with centralized operations, the need to ingest and process data efficiently and effectively is critical.\n6\nTable of Contents\nNowhere across the digital data lifecycle is transformation occurring at a greater rate and pace than at the edge. While the advantages of operating at the edge are clearly\nrecognized, it is only recently that physical technology has caught up with the virtual capabilities software has to offer. These advancements include the shrinking size of\nprocessors capable of performing advanced analytics at the edge and networking advancements such as 5G that can efficiently move the data processed at the edge (in real-\ntime).\nWith these advancements, the ability to move data processing workloads to the edge and achieve true digital transformation has started to become reality. To achieve the full\nvalue of this transformation, we must be able to do the following key technical attributes at the edge:\n• Structure data and analyze it in real-time,\n• Extract value from the analyzed data in real-time,\n• Securely transmit the usable data to the consumers who need it in real-time, and\n• Securely retain all data at the edge for regulatory/evidentiary purposes.\nAchieving these end-states at the edge should allow companies to substantially reduce the time needed to make decisions that affect operations across their environment, in\nsome cases in a predictive manner. This ability to make real-time decisions using data analyzed at the edge can transform operations across industry and government by\nimproving public safety, tailoring predictive maintenance, improving quality control, mitigating organized retail crime, and providing more efficient operations, which drive\nbetter customer experiences and operational outcomes.\nIn addition to the benefits achieved by increasing the speed and efficiency at which decisions can be made by offloading workflow and AI capabilities to the edge, significant\ncost benefits such as reduced operational costs associated with moving data across networks, processing and analyzing data using traditional massive backend servers and\nprocessors, and storage costs for extraneous data that is not valuable. Data security is also greatly enhanced, as are regulatory and compliance requirements for data, when\ncompared to legacy data center approaches to data management.\nSimilarly, transformative changes are happening between edge and the cloud, leveraging applications that allow you to interact with your data wherever it resides, at the edge,\non-premises, and/or in the cloud. True digital transformation can then be fully achieved when you have the “single pane of glass” interface that brings all your data together,\nsecurely, and efficiently, structured and analyzed, when and where the data consumer needs it.\nOur Solution\nAirship AI’s platform today is used across multiple verticals and markets, including commercial and government, and small and enterprise. Our products are purpose-built to be\nscalable and flexible, operating in the environments our customers are in today as well as where they want to be tomorrow. Our software can be installed in air-gapped stand-\nalone environments as well as enterprise-wide federated environments with countless devices, users, and end-points where data is aggregated and consumed. Our software is\ninstalled on bare-metal servers on-premises, in data centers, and in the cloud, as well as in physical and virtualized environments.\nOur software is also designed to replace existing capabilities as well as augment and/or enhance existing capabilities, from sensors to IT infrastructure to analytics. In many\ncases, our customers are able to achieve greater functionality out of existing capabilities through our unique approach to sensor integration and fusion than they could through\nthe OEM manufacturers offerings, further improving ROI on existing infrastructure and cost-savings on planned future technology.\nOur primary product offering is our software operating system, Airship Acropolis, supported by our edge (Airship Outpost AI) and end point visualization (Airship Command)\nofferings. Within Airship Acropolis, we have two variations, our commercial offering (Acropolis Commercial) and our government offering (Acropolis Law). While both\nvariations are derived from the same code base, each is tailored towards specific workflow and operational requirements for their respective customer environments.\n7\nTable of Contents\n• Acropolis Commercial. We built this platform first, supporting a variety of small and medium businesses across various commercial verticals, including schools,\nhospitals, casinos, logistics, and retail establishments. Our growth led us to larger commercial entities where we branched out from a standalone platform\nmanaging small numbers of cameras to an enterprise platform capable of managing hundreds of thousands of cameras and users from a single graphical user\ninterface. Acropolis Commercial continues to support our commercial customers’ requirements today.\n• Acropolis Law. We built this platform based on the success of our commercial offering and we have grown our customer base to include agencies across the law\nenforcement, defense, and intelligence sectors, with dozens of custom sensor integrations and unique workflows allowing agencies to break down data sharing\nsilos when operating standalone or in joint interagency environments.\nOur edge platform, Airship Outpost AI, can be used in a standalone environment as well as pointed back to Airship Acropolis. Outpost AI primarily ingests either single or\nmultiple feeds and using edge inference AI analyzes each feed for specific defined data parameters to alert on. All data is then encoded and streamed back to Acropolis securely\nfor downstream visualization as well as further processing and/or analysis.\nOur end point visualization platforms, Airship Command, consists of a thick client application, a web-based thin client, and our iOS and Android applications. Each of these\nvisualization applications provides users the opportunity to securely view and interact with data being managed by Acropolis and control sensors/devices at the edge. Airship\nCommand is the “single pane of glass” solution customers need.\nOur professional services include custom model training for customers using their proprietary and sensitive data, on-site and/or remote engineering services supporting\ncustomer deployments and operations, as well as custom integrations and workflow enhancements aimed at creating additional operational efficiencies in their environments.\nOur support and software maintenance agreements (“SMA”) create recurring revenue opportunities for the life of the contract and include options for general support as well as\ndedicated support through cleared individuals (up to the Top Secret clearance level). Our SMA provides customers access to new releases, patches, and other software updates\nas they are made public.\nOur Customer Base\nOur market-entry strategy has been to build enduring partnerships with large early adopters, or lighthouse customers, primarily in the United States. We believe these lighthouse\ncustomers serve as validation of our capabilities to other potential customers in similar and adjacent verticals by demonstrating the value and operational efficiencies our\nplatform provides. From our first lighthouse customer in the commercial space, we have successfully expanded our footprint to include additional enterprise customers in the\ncommercial market, as well as numerous federal, military, and intelligence agencies across the U.S. government.\nAfter our initial contract is established, our customers tend to expand their use of our products and services, as they realize the efficiency and value provided. We also tend to\nsee rapid expansion into adjacent buying entities within the customer, allowing them to break down data silos between functional areas that have historically existed, through\nthe sharing of data securely and efficiently across network and operational domains.\nWe believe there are substantial opportunities to leverage work done for our existing lighthouse customers in the commercial and government sectors, where we continue to see\ngrowing parallels around operational needs and the technology capabilities we provide that can solve them.\nRevenue Mix\nHistorically, a majority of our product revenue has consisted primarily of a bundled hardware and software product and to date we have sold or licensed a minimal amount of\nstandalone software. In the future, we expect to see more deliveries of our products using a cloud based software solution which will allow us to create additional subscription\nrevenue.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe expect to capitalize on the significant investments made over the last several years by refining our enterprise software platform for federated users in our defined customer\nverticals and completing the development of our AI driven edge hardware platform running our proprietary edge software and analytic platform.\nThese investments have positioned us to not only significantly grow market share at higher margins in these existing verticals but to also find and/or create opportunities in\ngreenfield spaces where the benefits of AI are just starting to emerge.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that our approach to providing a holistic data management solution that leverages AI is the key to our future success, as much as the foresight to build a scalable and\nfederated data management backend was when we first started our company. Our software and capabilities are more than just tools in a customer’s toolbox, they are integral\nparts of their day-to-day operational workflow and equally ingrained into their operational processes.\n• Single Pane of Glass Platform: Our platform brings together disparate edge generated data into one place, structured and unstructured, allowing our customers the\nability to visualize multiple analyzed data forms in a true “single pane of glass.” This approach substantially reduces the infrastructure, human and physical, that\nhas been historically needed to view and extract operational value from the customers’ data.\n• Superior Customer Experience: Our direct approach to customer engagements enables our team to manage the entire customer experience, starting with the first\nplatform demonstration and continuing through installation and long-term employment. This is key to our goal to build partnerships with our customers, which we\nequate to potential long-term recurring revenue engagements with strong opportunities for expansion within the organization.\n• Ease of Use and Adoption: Our solution is architected such that it can be installed in as little as one hour with minimal direct engagement or support needed, yet\nready to support operational engagements of a handful of users and devices to thousands of users and tens of thousands of attached devices. Everything within the\narchitecture is purpose built to be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to become operationally proficient in short order with limited training.\n• Hardened and Secure Platform: Our offerings are compliant with the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”), the Commercial Software and the Trade\nAgreements Act (“TAA”), and the Buy American Act. Thus, cybersecurity and safeguarding data at rest and in transit is factored into everything we do, resulting\nin our platform having been accredited with numerous Authorities to Operate (“ATO”) for U.S. government agencies for on-premise deployments as well at the\nFed Ramp high impact level in the secure cloud. This allows us to bring government-grade security to the larger commercial sector.\n• Significant Cost Savings: Our edge solution enables customers to add AI capabilities to their existing IT infrastructure, allowing them to immediately recognize\nthe operational benefits of our AI platform without having to add expensive backend servers. Additionally, our open approach to edge sensors and devices allows\ncustomers to extract the full value out of their existing devices compared to the more common industry standard rip and replace approach.\nMarket Opportunity\nAirship AI serves a large and rapidly growing addressable market. We determined the total addressable market (“TAM”) based upon publicly-available third-party industry\nreports on the current and projected markets for edge AI hardware and software offerings as well as federal, state, and local grants and set-aside funding for law enforcement,\npublic safety, and community violence intervention efforts.\nIn addition to the $7 billion combined edge AI hardware and software addressable market by 2029, growing at a blended compounded average growth rate (“CAGR”) of\n21.8%, for 2023 alone the U.S. government has set aside $3.2 billion in discretionary resources for state and local grants and $30 billion in mandatory resources to support law\nenforcement, crime prevention, and violence intervention, based on The President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2023.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our existing product market fit in the law enforcement vertical supported by our rapidly growing edge AI hardware and software offerings positions us well in this\nmarket. We plan to take advantage of this nexus market opportunity by targeting the larger state and local public safety marketplaces as well as commercial customers where\nour edge AI platform can allow them to participate in joint public-private ventures to improve public safety for their larger communities.\nWe expect that our market opportunity will continue to grow as we expand our edge AI hardware and software capabilities allowing us to serve our customers more broadly\nacross their operations.\nGrowth Strategy\nFor FY 2024, we started with a pipeline of $142 million, consisting largely of U.S. government agency contracts. The opportunities that make up this pipeline include\nopportunities for expansion within existing agencies as well as new opportunities within the agency and/or new agencies themselves. While many of these opportunities are\nmulti-year engagements which are expected to be highly competitive, they represent years of work of developing the opportunity around our unique value proposition and\ndifferentiators in support of a sole source award or to position Airship AI as the company to beat.\nWhile this pipeline represents the path for substantial growth over the next 12-18 months, we are executing a number of strategies which we believe will bring our value\nproposition to a broader audience in the United States and abroad.\n• Embrace Existing Direct Routes to Market While Building a Channel Program :Our focus in the near term is to continue building and expanding relationships\nwith existing customers who we enjoy direct relationships with, while we build partnerships with global integrators who bring capabilities outside our core\ncompetencies along with access and placement to customers and verticals which we do not currently enjoy. We believe that these strategies can not only co-exist\nbut be mutually beneficial.\n• Expand Our Technology Partnerships and Integrations: Our focus remains on providing a best of breed “single pane of glass” solution for our customers data\nmanagement challenges, which entails expanding our existing technology partnership ecosystem within our existing customer framework, as well as adjacent\nverticals. We believe this will drive new customer acquisitions as well as help expand our distribution capability into spaces our partners already participate.\n• Commercial Expansion: Based on our existing lighthouse customers and the rapid acceleration of AI in solving public safety and operational challenges, we see\nsignificant opportunities for expansion of our platform in the broader commercial marketplace. While we see opportunities across multiple industry verticals, our\nfocus in the short term will be on those verticals that can immediately benefit from the work already done, significantly reducing additional development efforts\nalong with shortening the sales cycle. These verticals include infrastructure, transportation, logistics, and retail.\n• Strategic M&A Activities: As part of our commercial landing and government expansion strategies, we plan to focus on strategic acquisition targets with\ncomplementary technologies that can rapidly accelerate existing development efforts or add new capabilities to our platform that are supportive of our existing\ntechnology partnerships and routes to market strategies.\nEmployees\nWe employed forty seven employees as of December 31, 2023. The employees are headquartered in Redmond, WA and are supported by a growing team at our Customer\nCenter of Excellence located in Charlotte, NC. We employed eight research and development personnel in Taiwan as of December 31, 2023.\nIntellectual Property\nWe do not have any patents and instead rely on trade secrets and know-how in the development of our business. Although large technology companies use patent portfolios as a\nmeans of strategic and legal deterrence, we believe it is more advantageous not to disclose our proprietary know-how.\n10\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business,\nprospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not known to us or that we consider immaterial as of the date of\nthis annual report. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. The following\ndiscussion should be read in conjunction with Airship AI’s financial statements and notes thereto included herein. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in\naddition to the other information included in this annual report.\nRisks Related to Airship AI’s Business and Industry\nThe market for Airship AI’s edge AI services and products is relatively new, and may decline or experience limited growth, and Airship AI’s business is dependent on its\nclients’ continuing adoption and use its services and products.\nThe edge AI market is relatively new and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Airship AI has developed an edge AI platform system. Through this platform, we\ndeliver our edge AI services to our clients, which include law enforcement, military, and commercial enterprise organizations. Airship AI believes that our future success will\nsignificantly depend on the growth, if any, of this market and the use of our services and products, including our Nexus real-time analytics technology.\nThe use of edge AI is still relatively new, and consumers may not recognize the need for or benefits of our services and products. If consumers do not recognize the need for\nand benefits of our services and products, then they may decide to adopt alternative services to satisfy some portion of their business needs. In order to grow our business and\nextend our market position, Airship AI intends to focus on educating potential customers about the benefits of our services and products, expanding the range of Airship AI’s\nservices and bringing new technologies to market to increase market acceptance and use of our platform. Airship AI’s ability to expand the market that our services and products\naddress depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our services and products. The market for our services and\nproducts could fail to grow significantly or there could be a reduction in demand for our services and/or products as a result of a lack of acceptance, technological challenges,\ncompeting services, a decrease in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. If the edge AI market does not experience\nsignificant growth, or demand for its services and/or products decreases, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf Airship AI does not develop enhancements to its services and introduce new services that achieve market acceptance, its growth, business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nAirship AI’s ability to attract new clients and increase revenue from existing clients depends, in part, on its ability to enhance and improve its existing services, increase\nadoption and usage of its services, and introduce new services. The success of any enhancements or new services depends on several factors, including timely completion,\nadequate quality testing, actual performance quality, market accepted pricing levels and overall market acceptance.\nEnhancements, such as additional technology features, and new services, such as software licenses and data services, that Airship AI develops may not be introduced in a timely\nor cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, may have interoperability difficulties with its platform or other services or may not achieve the broad market acceptance\nnecessary to generate significant revenue. Furthermore, Airship AI’s ability to increase the usage of its services depends, in part, on the development of new uses for its services,\nwhich may be outside of its control. Its ability to generate usage of additional services by its data consumers may also require increasingly sophisticated and more costly sales\nefforts and result in a longer sales cycle. If Airship AI is unable to successfully enhance its existing services to meet evolving data consumer requirements, increase adoption\nand usage of its services, develop new services, or if its efforts to increase the usage of its services are more expensive than Airship AI expects, then its business, results of\noperations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAirship AI has experienced moderate growth in the past several years, and if Airship AI fails to effectively manage its growth, then its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nAirship AI has experienced moderate growth in its business since 2016 when Airship AI developed its edge AI capabilities in video analytics and cyber analytics. For example,\nAirship AI has also experienced significant growth in the number of data consumers, usage and amount of data that its platform and associated infrastructure support. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on its corporate culture, operational infrastructure and management. Any failure to manage Airship AI’s\nanticipated growth and organizational changes in a manner that preserves the key aspects of its culture and services could adversely affect Airship AI’s overall chance for future\nsuccess, including its ability to recruit and retain personnel, and effectively focus on and pursue its corporate objectives. This, in turn, could adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, Airship AI’s ability to manage its operations and future growth will require Airship AI to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls,\ncompliance programs with multiple and changing international laws and regulations and reporting systems. Airship AI is currently in the process of strengthening its\ncompliance programs, including its compliance programs related to data protection, privacy and cybersecurity and anti-corruption. Airship AI may not be able to implement\nimprovements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems and procedures, which could have an adverse effect on its\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nAirship AI’s sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and its sales cycle is often long and unpredictable.\nAirship AI’s results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle. As part of our\nsales efforts, we invest considerable time and expense evaluating the specific organizational needs of our potential customers and educating these potential customers about the\ntechnical capabilities and value of our platforms and services. We often also provide our platforms to potential customers at no or low cost initially to them for evaluation\npurposes through short-term pilot deployments of our platforms, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to convert customers from these short-term pilot deployments to\nfull revenue-generating contracts. In addition, we have a growing direct sales force, and our sales efforts have historically depended on the significant involvement of our senior\nmanagement team. The length of our sales cycle, from initial demonstration of our platforms to sale of our platforms and services, tends to be long and varies substantially from\ncustomer to customer. Our sales cycle often lasts six to nine months but can extend to a year or more for some customers. Because decisions to purchase our platforms involve\nsignificant financial commitments, potential customers generally evaluate our platforms at multiple levels within their organization, each of which often have specific\nrequirements, and typically involve their senior management.\nOur results of operations depend on sales to government and commercial enterprise organizations, which make product purchasing decisions based in part or entirely on factors,\nor perceived factors, not directly related to the features of the platforms, including, among others, that customer’s projections of business growth, uncertainty about\nmacroeconomic conditions (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and related economic sanctions, rising inflation and\ninterest rates, or monetary policy changes), capital budgets, anticipated cost savings from the implementation of our platforms, potential preference for such customer’s\ninternally-developed software solutions, perceptions about our business and platforms, more favorable terms offered by potential competitors, and previous technology\ninvestments. In addition, certain decision makers and other stakeholders within our potential customers tend to have vested interests in the continued use of internally developed\nor existing software, which may make it more difficult for us to sell our platforms and services. As a result of these and other factors, our sales efforts typically require an\nextensive effort throughout a customer’s organization, a significant investment of human resources, expense and time, including by our senior management, and there can be no\nassurances that we will be successful in making a sale to a potential customer. If our sales efforts to a potential customer do not result in sufficient revenue to justify our\ninvestments, including in our growing direct sales force, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, existing customers have expanded their relationships with Airship AI, which has resulted in a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial\nportion of its revenue. If existing customers do not make subsequent purchases from Airship AI or renew their contracts with Airship AI, or if its relationships with its\nlargest customers are impaired or terminated, Airship AI’s revenue could decline, and its results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from existing customers that expand their relationships with us. Increasing the size and number of the deployments of our\nexisting customers is a major part of our growth strategy. We may not be effective in executing this or any other aspect of our growth strategy.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, three customers represented 34%, 21% and 12% of total revenue from 58 customers, although such a high level of customer\nconcentration is not typical. We are not substantially dependent on these three customers or any one customer. The primary reason for the increase in reliance on a single\ncustomer for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the lag-time in delivering on a large order received in late 2022 from one division of a customer which was not\nfulfilled until 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers represented 28% and 17% of total revenue from 45 customers, which is more representative of our\ntypical customer concentration. Our top customers by revenue have been long term customers. From time to time, we may lose a major customer. It is not possible for us to\npredict the future level of demand from our larger customers for our platforms and applications.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe do not have any master service agreements with our customers. For our government agency customers, we must submit and complete standard bidding forms which contain\nall the applicable terms and conditions for our service offerings. In order to bid and secure government agency contracts, we either work directly with certain governmental\nagencies or work with and through the entity that has the prime bidding relationship with the government agencies. For our commercial customers, they submit detailed\npurchase orders which generally contain all the key terms and conditions, but such purchase orders may be supported by separate statements of work for particular projects.\nAirship AI’s customer awards, either through commercial or government customers, come in a variety of forms depending on if the relationship with the customer is a direct\nrelationship or if it is through a partner. For direct relationships, Airship AI receives the award directly from the commercial customer or government agency, either in the form\nof a purchase order or the requisite government form. For indirect or partner based awards, Airship AI receives the award in the form of a purchase order or task order against\nthe specific effort being awarded.\nRegardless of the form of the purchase order and/or the customer vertical, Airship AI has standard terms and conditions which are applied to all awards accepted. These include\nthe specific line items by quantity being acquired, the delivery period for which Airship AI has to deliver the products and services awarded, the support and maintenance\noffering desired, and the total period of performance for the award (single year or multi-year). Payment is due within 30 days of when the invoice is received irrespective of the\ntype of customer.\nWhile we generally offer contract terms up to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts, such as one-year subscriptions, which may not\nprovide for automatic renewal and may require the customer to opt-in to extend the term. Our customers have no obligation to renew, upgrade, or expand their agreements with\nus after the terms of their existing agreements have expired. In addition, many of our customer contracts permit the customer to terminate their contracts with us with notice\nperiods of varying lengths, generally three to six months. If one or more of our customers terminate their contracts with us, whether for convenience, for default in the event of a\nbreach by us, or for other reasons specified in our contracts, as applicable; if our customers elect not to renew their contracts with us; if our customers renew their contractual\narrangements with us for shorter contract lengths or for a reduced scope; or if our customers otherwise seek to renegotiate terms of their existing agreements on terms less\nfavorable to us, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. This adverse impact would be even more pronounced for customers that represent a material\nportion of our revenue or business operations.\nOur ability to renew or expand our customer relationships may decrease or vary as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with\nour platforms and services, the frequency and severity of software and implementation errors, our platforms’ reliability, our pricing, the effects of general economic conditions,\ncompetitive offerings or alternatives, or reductions in our customers’ spending levels. If our customers do not renew or expand their agreements with us or if they renew their\ncontracts for shorter lengths or on other terms less favorable to us, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our business could suffer. Our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would also be adversely affected if we face difficulty collecting our accounts receivable from our customers or if we are required\nto refund customer deposits.\nAchieving renewal or expansion of deployments may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales efforts that may not result in additional sales. In\naddition, our customers’ decisions to expand the deployment of our platforms depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the functioning of our\nplatforms, the ability of our forward-deployed engineers to assist our customers in identifying new use cases, modernizing their data architectures, and achieving success with\ndata-driven initiatives, and our customers’ satisfaction with our services. If our efforts to expand within our existing customer base are not successful, our business may suffer.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in Airship AI’s results of operations and financial position.\nHistorically, the first quarter of our year generally has relatively lower sales, and sales generally increase in each subsequent quarter with substantial increases during our third\nand fourth quarters ending September 30 and December 31, respectively. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\n• the fiscal year end procurement cycle of our government customers, and in particular U.S. government customers which have a fiscal year end of September 30;\n13\nTable of Contents\n• the fiscal year budgeting process for our commercial customers, many of which have a fiscal year end of December 31;\n• seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions; and\n• timing of projects and our customers’ evaluation of our work progress.\nThis seasonality has historically impacted and may in the future continue to impact the timing of collections and recognized revenue. Because a significant portion of our\ncustomer contracts are typically finalized near the end of the year, and we typically invoice customers shortly after entering into a contract, we may receive a portion of our\ncustomer payments near the end of the year and record such payment as an increase in deferred revenue or customer deposits (“contract liabilities”), while the revenue from our\ncustomer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. While we have historically billed and collected payments for multiple contract years from certain customers\nin advance, we have and may continue to shift to collecting payments on an annual or other basis.\nWhile this has been the historical seasonal pattern of our quarterly sales, we believe that our customers’ required timing for certain new government or commercial programs\nrequiring new software may outweigh the nature or magnitude of seasonal factors that might have influenced our business to date. As a result, we may experience future growth\nfrom additional government or commercial mandates that do not follow the seasonal purchasing and evaluation decisions by our customers that we have historically observed.\nFor example, increased government spending on technology aimed at national defense, financial or policy regulation, cybersecurity, or healthcare mandates may drive customer\ndemand at different times throughout our year, the timing of which we may not be able to anticipate and may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. The timing of our\nfiscal quarters and the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end also may impact sales to governmental agencies in the third quarter of our year, offsetting, at\nleast in part, the otherwise seasonal downturn we have historically observed in later summer months.\nOur recent growth may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. We expect that seasonality will\ncontinue to materially impact our business in the future and may become more pronounced over time. The seasonality of our business may cause continued or increased\nfluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, which may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of\nresearch analysts or investors, which in turn may cause a decline in the trading price of our securities.\nIf Airship AI does not successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of its customers, its business and results of operations could suffer.\nAirship AI’s success has been based on our ability to design software and products that enable the integration of data into a common operating environment to facilitate\nadvanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing new technologies and\nenhanced versions of existing features to meet our customers’ and potential customers’ rapidly evolving needs. There is no assurance that our enhancements to our platforms or\nour new product features, capabilities, or offerings, including new product modules, will be compelling to our customers or gain market acceptance. If our research and\ndevelopment investments do not accurately anticipate customer demand or if we fail to develop our platforms in a manner that satisfies customer preferences in a timely and\ncost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing customers or increase demand for our platforms.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our platforms obsolete\nor adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing that delay or\nprevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new platforms, features, or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release\ndates of new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new platforms, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result\nin adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by customers brought against us, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, the design and\ndevelopment of new platforms or new features and capabilities to our existing platforms may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments\nwill be successful. If customers do not widely adopt our new platforms, experiences, features, and capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOur new and existing platforms and changes to our existing platforms could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n• our failure to predict market demand accurately in terms of product functionality and to supply offerings that meet this demand in a timely fashion;\n• product defects, errors, or failures or our inability to satisfy customer service level requirements;\n• negative publicity or negative private statements about the security, performance, or effectiveness of our platforms or product enhancements;\n• delays in releasing to the market our new offerings or enhancements to our existing offerings, including new product modules;\n• introduction or anticipated introduction of competing platforms or functionalities by our competitors;\n• inability of our platforms or product enhancements to scale and perform to meet customer demands;\n• receiving qualified or adverse opinions in connection with security or penetration testing, certifications or audits, such as those related to IT controls and security\nstandards and frameworks or compliance;\n• poor business conditions for our customers, causing them to delay software purchases;\n• reluctance of customers to purchase proprietary software products;\n• reluctance of our customers to purchase products hosted by our vendors and/or service interruption from such providers; and\n• reluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating open source software.\nIf we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by our customers and develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platforms in a timely and cost-\neffective manner, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may suffer and our\nanticipated revenue growth may not be achieved. Because we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from customers purchasing our platforms\nand products, market acceptance of these platforms and products, and any enhancements or changes thereto, is critical to our success.\nAirship AI’s ability to sell its platforms and satisfy its customers is dependent on the quality of Airship AI’s services, and its failure to offer high quality services could have\na material adverse effect on its sales and results of operations.\nOnce Airship AI’s platforms are deployed and integrated with our customers’ existing information technology investments and data, our customers depend on our support and\nmaintenance services to resolve any issues relating to our platforms. Increasingly, our platforms have been deployed in large-scale, complex technology environments, and we\nbelieve our future success will depend on our ability to increase sales of our platforms for use in such deployments. Further, our ability to provide effective ongoing services, or\nto provide such services in a timely, efficient, or scalable manner, may depend in part on our customers’ environments and their upgrading to the latest versions of our platforms\nand participating in our centralized platform management and services.\nIn addition, our ability to provide effective services is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel with experience in supporting customers on\nplatforms such as ours. The number of our customers has grown significantly, and that growth has and may continue to put additional pressure on our services teams. We may\nbe unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for our support and maintenance services. We also may be unable to modify the\nfuture scope and delivery of our support and maintenance services to compete with changes in the services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for support,\nwithout corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and expand\noutside of the United States, we need to be able to provide efficient services that meet our customers’ needs globally at scale, and our services teams may face additional\nchallenges, including those associated with operating the platforms and delivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than English and providing services\nacross expanded time-zones. If we are unable to provide efficient support and maintenance services globally at scale, our ability to grow our operations may be harmed, and we\nmay need to hire additional services personnel, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOur customers typically need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our platforms to maximize the potential of our platforms. If we do\nnot effectively deploy, update, or upgrade our platforms, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing services, our\nability to sell additional products and services to existing customers could be adversely affected, we may face negative publicity, and our reputation with potential customers\ncould be damaged. Many enterprise and government customers require higher levels of service than smaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of the larger\ncustomers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger customers. As a result, our failure to maintain high quality services may\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIf Airship AI is not able to maintain and enhance its brand and reputation, Airship AI’s relationships with its customers, partners, and employees may be harmed, and its\nbusiness and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity and reputation is important to our relationships with, and to our ability to attract and retain customers, partners,\ninvestors, and employees. The successful promotion of our brand depends upon our ability to continue to offer high-quality software, maintain strong relationships with our\ncustomers, the community, and others, while successfully differentiating our platforms from those of our competitors. Unfavorable media coverage may adversely affect our\nbrand and reputation. We anticipate that as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and\nexpensive. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand identity and reputation, we may fail to attract and retain employees, customers, investors, or partners, grow\nour business, or sustain pricing power, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Additionally, despite\nour internal safeguards and efforts to the contrary, we cannot guarantee that our customers will not ultimately use our platforms for purposes inconsistent with our company\nvalues, and such uses may harm our brand and reputation.\nIf the market for Airship AI’s platforms and services develops more slowly than Airship AI expects, its growth may slow or stall, and its business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for Airship AI’s platforms is rapidly evolving. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth and expansion of this market, which is difficult to predict\nand relies on a number of factors, including customer adoption, customer demand, changing customer needs, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing\ncompetitive products, potential customers’ willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and processing and their willingness to invest in new software\nafter significant prior investments in legacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and assumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity\nare subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for\nour platforms and services at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasts, our\nbusiness could fail to grow at the levels we expect or at all for a variety of reasons outside our control, including competition in our industry. Further, if we or other data\nmanagement and analytics providers experience security breaches or incidents, loss, corruption, or unavailability of or unauthorized access to customer data, disruptions in\ndelivery, or other problems, this market as a whole, including our platforms, may be negatively affected. If software for the challenges that we address does not achieve\nwidespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions (including due to the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and related economic sanctions, rising inflation and interest rates, and monetary policy changes), security or\nprivacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, or otherwise, or, alternatively, if the market develops but we are unable to continue to\npenetrate it due to the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platforms, or other factors, it could result in decreased revenue and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIssues raised by the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in Airship AI’s platforms may result in reputational harm or liability.\nAI is enabled by or integrated into some of Airship AI’s technology platforms and is a significant and potentially growing element of our business. As with many developing\ntechnologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets in\nAI training, development, or operations may be insufficient, of poor quality, or reflect unwanted forms of bias. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by, or practices\nreflecting inherent biases of, data scientists, engineers, and end-users of our systems could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. If the recommendations, forecasts, or analyses\nthat AI applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, including under new proposed legislation\nregulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. Though our technologies and business\npractices are designed to mitigate many of these risks, if we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial or problematic because of their purported or real impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, as well as regulatory or legal scrutiny.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, defects, or bugs in Airship AI’s platforms could adversely affect its results of operations and growth prospects.\nBecause Airship AI offers very complex technology platforms, undetected errors, defects, failures, or bugs have occurred and may in the future occur, especially when platforms\nor capabilities are first introduced or when new versions or other product or infrastructure updates are released. Our platforms are often installed and used in large-scale\ncomputing environments with different operating systems, software products and equipment, and data source and network configurations, which may cause errors or failures in\nour platforms or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms. Despite testing by us, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new software or releases\nuntil after commencement of commercial shipments. In the past, errors have affected the performance of our platforms and can also delay the development or release of new\nplatforms or capabilities or new versions of platforms, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to buy platforms from us, and adversely affect market\nacceptance or perception of our platforms. Many of our customers use our platforms in applications that are critical to their businesses or missions and may have a lower risk\ntolerance to defects in our platforms than to defects in other, less critical, software products. Any errors or delays in releasing new software or new versions of platforms or\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance, errors, defects, or failures in released software could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to\nincur substantial costs in redesigning the software, cause us to lose significant customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one\nof which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our platforms could be perceived to be ineffective for a\nvariety of reasons outside of our control. Hackers or other malicious parties could circumvent our or our customers’ security measures, and customers may misuse our platforms\nresulting in a security breach or perceived product failure.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms and services, or dissatisfaction with our services and outcomes, could result in customer terminations and/or claims\nby customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or we may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in\norder to help correct any such errors, failures, or bugs. Although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard software licensing and service agreement terms and\nconditions, these provisions may not be enforceable in some circumstances, may vary in levels of protection across our agreements, or may not fully or effectively protect us\nfrom such claims and related liabilities and costs. We generally provide a warranty to our customers for our software products and services. In the event that there is a failure of\nwarranties in such agreements, we are generally obligated to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision as set forth in the applicable agreement, or, if we\nare unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). The sale and support of\nour products also entail the risk of product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance\ncoverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation\nand divert management’s time and other resources.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, our platforms integrate a wide variety of other elements, and our platforms must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors and our customers’\ninternally developed software. As a result, when problems occur for a customer using our platforms, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems, and we may\nreceive blame for a security, access control, or other compliance breach that was the result of the failure of one of the other elements in a customer’s or another vendor’s IT,\nsecurity, or compliance infrastructure. The occurrence of software or errors in data, whether or not caused by our platforms, could delay or reduce market acceptance of our\nplatforms and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance, and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any\nsuch problems could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If an actual or perceived breach of information correctness, auditability, integrity, or\navailability occurs in one of our customers’ systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our platforms, the market perception of the effectiveness of our platforms\ncould be harmed. Alleviating any of these problems could require additional significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or\ncessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and growth prospects.\nAirship AI may not be able to adequately protect or enforce its intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering its\nsolutions. Airship AI’s efforts to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from violating its rights may be costly.\nThe success of Airship AI’s services and its business depends, in part, on Airship AI’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for its\nproducts in the United States and other international jurisdictions. Airship AI does not have any patents. Airship AI relies on a combination of copyright, service mark, and trade\nsecret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual obligations, to establish and protect its proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. Airship\nAI cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent unauthorized use of its technology or the reverse engineering of its technology. Moreover, others may independently\ndevelop technologies that are competitive to Airship AI or infringe Airship AI’s intellectual property.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of Airship AI’s intellectual property, products and other proprietary rights is expensive and can be difficult, particularly with respect to\ninternational jurisdictions. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer Airship AI’s solutions or certain aspects of Airship AI’s solutions that are considered\nproprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend Airship AI’s intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse\nengineering its solutions, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to block the importation of infringing products into the U.S. Any such\nlitigation, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert the attention of management and may not ultimately be resolved in Airship AI’s favor.\nEffective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or applied for in every country in which Airship AI’s products are available and\ncompetitors based in other countries may sell infringing products in one or more markets. An inability to adequately protect and enforce Airship AI’s intellectual property and\nother proprietary rights or an inability to prevent authorized parties from copying or reverse engineering its technology solutions or certain aspects of its solutions that Airship\nAI considers proprietary could adversely affect its business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nAirship AI relies on its unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how.\nAirship AI relies on proprietary information (such as trade secrets, know-how and confidential information) to protect intellectual property that may not be patentable or subject\nto copyright, trademark, trade dress or service mark protection, or that Airship AI believes is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure.\nAirship AI generally seeks to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements, or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain\nnon-disclosure and non-use provisions with its employees, consultants, contractors and third parties. However, Airship AI may fail to enter into the necessary agreements and,\neven if entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary information,\nmay be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. Airship AI has limited control\nover the protection of trade secrets used by its current or future manufacturing partners and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure\nof such information occurs. In addition, Airship AI’s proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by its competitors or other third\nparties. To the extent that its employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and other third parties use intellectual property owned by others in their work for Airship AI, disputes\nmay arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of\nAirship AI’s proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection for its proprietary information could adversely affect its competitive business position. Furthermore,\nlaws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets where Airship AI operates may afford limited or no protection for its trade secrets.\n18\nTable of Contents\nAirship AI also relies on physical and electronic security measures to protect its proprietary information, but it cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be\nbreached or that these measures will provide adequate protection. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize Airship AI’s proprietary information to its\ncompetitive disadvantage. Airship AI may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce its\nintellectual property rights.\nAirship AI has not been profitable in the past and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe had net income and net loss of approximately $16,371,000 and $487,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There can be no assurance that\nAirship AI will ever achieve the level of revenues needed to be profitable in the future and if profitability is achieved, that it will be sustained. Airship AI’s revenues have\nfluctuated and may likely continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Airship AI will need to obtain additional capital and increase sales to\nbecome profitable.\nAirship AI requires substantial additional funding, which may not be available to Airship AI on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require Airship AI\nto delay, limit, reduce or cease its operations.\nAirship AI has limited financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funding will be available to us to fund our operating expenses and to further develop our\nbusiness. Unless we achieve substantial profitability, we anticipate that we will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our operations while we implement and execute our\nbusiness plan. We currently do not have any contracts or commitments for additional financing. In addition, any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to\nour existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on a timely basis or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Failure to obtain\nsuch additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of operations or the further development of our business. If adequate funds are not available or are not\navailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to further fund our business or the expansion thereof, take advantage of strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities or\nrespond to competitive pressures. Such inability to obtain additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash\nflow, financial condition and prospects.\nThere can be no assurance that Airship AI will be able to comply with the terms of its convertible note.\nAirship AI issued senior secured convertible promissory notes on June 22, 2023 and October 3, 2023 in principal amounts totaling $2,600,000. Pursuant to the terms of a senior\nsecured convertible promissory notes, $2,000,000 is due on June 22, 2024 and $600,000 is due on September 30, 2024. Failure to repay the principal amounts on the due date,\nan additional 10% and related interest or to convert these amounts into shares of Airship AI common stock in accordance with the promissory notes would result in a default.\nWe may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such outstanding amounts and the holder could foreclose upon critical assets. Any of these outcomes would have\nan adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAirship AI has a limited operating history. There can be no assurance that Airship AI will be successful in growing its business.\nWe have a limited history of operations. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our operations. Any potential for future growth will place additional\ndemands on our executive officers, and any increased scope of our operations will present challenges due to our current limited management resources. There can be no\nassurance that we will be successful in our efforts. Our inability to locate additional opportunities, to hire additional management and other personnel, or to enhance our\nmanagement systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that our operations will be profitable.\nAirship AI faces intense competition within its industry and is subject to the effects of technology change.\nThe industry in which we are engaged is subject to rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that Airship AI’s systems can be upgraded to meet\nfuture innovations in the industry or that new technologies will not emerge, or existing technologies will not be improved, which would render Airship AI’s offerings obsolete\nor non-competitive. Many of the companies we compete with enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition; greater financial, technical\nand service resources; established networks; additional product offerings; and greater resources for product development and sales and marketing. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that other established technology companies, any of which would likely have greater resources than Airship AI, will not enter the market. There can be no assurance\nthat Airship AI will be able to compete successfully against any of its competitors.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAirship AI’s proprietary products and services and service delivery may not operate properly, which could damage its reputation, give rise to claims against Airship AI, or\ndivert application of its resources from other purposes, any of which could harm its business and operating results.\nWe may encounter supply chain, human, or technical obstacles that prevent our products and services from operating profitably. If our offerings do not function reliably or fail\nto achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us or cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation\nand impair our ability to attract or maintain customers. We cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our products will not arise in the future. Errors\nmay result from receipt, entry, or interpretation of customer information or from interface of our services. These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address\nthem could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources,\ninjury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may\nbe substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf critical components used in Airship AI’s products become scarce or unavailable, Airship AI may incur delays in delivering its products and providing services, which\ncould damage its business. Airship AI relies on a sustainable supply chain. Any issues with this supply chain could adversely affect daily business operations and\nprofitability.\nWe depend on third party providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware, software and support necessary to provide some of our products and services. We\nobtain these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history, or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment,\nsupplies, and services we desire. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors represent our primary or sole source of supply or have, either through\ncontract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity or if these vendors experience operating or\nfinancial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to\nprovide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability\nto serve our customers. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations,\nbusiness, financial results and financial condition.\nUnavailability of materials or higher costs could adversely affect Airship AI’s financial results.\nWe depend on certain domestic and international suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates\nrisks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and\nsub-assemblies. Specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer\nparts for our products. Although we have and are implementing additional long-term agreements with strategic suppliers to mitigate the risk of supply continuity, there remains\nrisk across our supply chain while we extend our supplier contract program, and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted. Additionally, if our suppliers do not\naccurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or they decommit to us previously agreed to supply levels,\nit may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our\nactual needs, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\nSingle or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. Delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may\ntake weeks or months to resolve. In some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. These delays could cause\nsignificant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and could harm our\nreputation.\n20\nTable of Contents\nA significant number of our raw materials or components are comprised of petroleum-based products or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw\nmaterials or components to our facility. Our freight and import costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could\nreduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs; potential port closures; customs clearance issues; increased government regulation or regulatory changes\nfor imports of foreign products into the U.S.; delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages; and other matters. Any\ninterruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues,\nprofitability and financial condition. For example, there have been disruptions in the semi-conductor supply chain that could negatively impact our ability to make our products.\nWhile many of the COVID-19 driven supply chain issues have been resolved, challenges to the timely production and delivery of Taiwan based products we utilize for our edge\nAI platform due to geo-political factors is a concern looking forward. In the event that our suppliers are unable to provide timely delivery of those supplies it will significantly\nimpact our ability to meet delivery schedules for existing and anticipated edge AI hardware-based solutions.\nInternational or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials or\ncomponents and other government trade policies, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials or components, and could adversely impact our revenues,\nprofitability and financial condition. In particular, the implementation of tariffs and trade restrictions as well as changes in trade policies between the U.S. and China may have\nan adverse effect on our supply chain from a sourcing and cost perspective. We source certain raw materials from China, as do some of our suppliers. We may be unable to\ntransition away from China to other jurisdictions or obtain secondary source s for raw materials which could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and\nfinancial condition.\nIf Airship AI’s security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our service may be perceived as insecure, the attractiveness\nof its services to current or potential customers may be reduced, and Airship AI may incur significant liabilities.\nAirship AI services involve the web-based and data storage and transmission of customers’ information. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software,\ntools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of such information. Because of the sensitivity of this information\nand due to requirements under applicable laws and regulations, the effectiveness of our security efforts is very important. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result\nof third-party action, acts of terror, social unrest, employee error, malfeasance or for any other reasons, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to customer data.\nImproper activities by third-parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may\nfacilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our security systems. Our security measures may not be effective in preventing unauthorized access to the customer data stored\non our servers. If a breach of our security occurs, we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, possible lawsuits by\nindividuals affected by the breach and significant remediation costs and efforts to prevent future occurrences. In addition, whether there is an actual or a perceived breach of our\nsecurity, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose current or potential customers.\nThe loss of one or more of Airship AI’s significant customers, or any other reduction in the amount of revenue Airship AI derives from any such customer, would adversely\naffect its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAirship AI sells its product to commercial and government customers under agreements that are normally paid within 30 days of contract completion. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, three customers represented 34%, 21% and 12% of total revenue from 58 customers, although such a high level of customer concentration is not typical.\nThe primary reason for the increase in reliance on a single customer for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the lag-time in delivering on a large order received in late\n2022 from one division of a customer which was not fulfilled until 2023. As of December 31, 2023, three customers represented approximately 51%, 26% and 17% of\noutstanding account receivables. Due to the customers and timely payments, customer concentration in account receivables is minimal.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers represented 28% and 17% of total revenue from 45 customers, which is more representative of our typical customer\nconcentration. As of December 31, 2022, four customers represent approximately 42%, 19%, 14% and 10% of outstanding account receivables. Due to the customers and\ntimely payments, customer concentration in account receivables is minimal.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers in the future and, in some cases, the portion of our revenue attributable\nto individual customers may increase. The loss of one or more significant customers or a reduction in the amount of revenue we derive from any such customer could\nsignificantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers may choose not to renew their contracts or may otherwise reduce the\nbreadth of the offerings which they purchase for any number of reasons. We are also subject to the risk that any such customer will experience financial difficulties that prevent\nthem from making payments to us on a timely basis or at all.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAirship AI depends on key information systems and third party service providers.\nWe depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business. These systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting\nfrom, among other things, pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software or equipment failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or\nsupplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure\nof these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or\nother business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties’ intent on extracting\nconfidential information, disrupting business processes or corrupting information. These risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service\nprovider personnel. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure\nto retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to Airship AI’s competitive position.\nIncreased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks have resulted in an increase in information security risks in recent years. Hackers develop and deploy\nviruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack products and services and gain access to networks and data centers. If we experience difficulties maintaining\nexisting systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary\nand confidential information and may contain personal data of our customers. A security breach could result in disruptions of our internal systems and business applications,\nharm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. As cyber threats\ncontinue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any\ninformation security vulnerabilities. Any of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nClaims by others that Airship AI infringes their intellectual property could force Airship AI to incur significant costs or revise the way Airship AI conducts its business.\nOur competitors protect their proprietary rights by means of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. We have not conducted an\nindependent review of patents and other intellectual property issued to third-parties, who may have patents or patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We\nmay receive letters from third parties alleging, or inquiring about, possible infringement, misappropriation or violation of their intellectual property rights. Any party asserting\nthat we infringe, misappropriate or violate proprietary rights may force us to defend ourselves, and potentially our customers, against the alleged claim. These claims and any\nresulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and/or invalidation of our proprietary rights or interruption or cessation of our operations.\nAny such claims or lawsuit could:\n• be time-consuming and expensive to defend, whether meritorious or not;\n• require us to stop providing products or services that use the technology that allegedly infringes the other party’s intellectual property;\n• divert the attention of our technical and managerial resources;\n• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third-parties, which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable;\n22\nTable of Contents\n• prevent us from operating all or a portion of our business or force us to redesign our products, services or technology platforms, which could be difficult and\nexpensive and may make the performance or value of our product or service offerings less attractive;\n• subject us to significant liability for damages or result in significant settlement payments; or\n• require us to indemnify our customers.\nFurthermore, during the course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests,\ndepositions or trial testimony. Disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In\naddition, any litigation could significantly harm our relationships with current and prospective customers. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAirship AI’s success depends upon the continued protection of its intellectual property rights and Airship AI may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend,\nprotect and enforce its intellectual property rights.\nWe do not have any patents and instead rely on trade secrets and know-how in the development of our business, which are of material importance to Airship AI and its future\nprospects. Competitors may attempt to challenge our IP and IP systems, or may be able to design alternative techniques or devices that develop products with functionalities\nthat are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor infringes upon our intellectual property, enforcing those rights, even if successful, could be expensive, uncertain, difficult\nand time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that Airship AI’s products will not infringe\non others. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our IP against challenges from others.\nAirship AI depends on its management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled\nemployees could adversely affect its business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to\nattract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Although we have entered into employment or consulting agreements with our personnel, their employment is generally for no specific\nduration.\nOur future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management team, which include Victor Huang, our co-Founder and\nChief Executive Officer, and Derek Xu, our co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product\ninnovations. The loss of services of our senior management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Technology Officer, could\nsignificantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAirship AI’s management team has limited experience managing a public company and regulatory compliance may divert their attention from the day-to-day management\nof Airship AI’s business.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public\ncompanies. These obligations typically require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness.\nAirship AI’s business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations\ncould have an adverse effect on Airship AI’s business and operating results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur future depends, in part, on continuing sales to government organizations. Demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, subject to budgetary uncertainty\nand typically involves long sales cycles. We have made significant investments to address the government sector, but we cannot assure you that these investments will be\nsuccessful, or that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the government sector. Although we anticipate that they may increase in the future, sales to\ngovernmental organizations have not accounted for, and may never account for, a significant portion of our revenue. Sales to governmental organizations are subject to a\nnumber of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business. Sales to such government entities include the following risks:\n• selling to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any\nassurance that such efforts will generate a sale;\n• government certification requirements applicable to our platform may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the governmental sector until we\nhave attained the revised certification;\n• government demand and payment for our platform may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or\ndelays adversely affecting public sector demand for our platform; and\n• governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing\nto continue buying our platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and operating results.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governmental organizations to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse\neffect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, products, or technologies may require significant management attention and could disrupt Airship AI’s business, dilute\nstockholder value, and adversely affect its operating results.\nOur business strategy may include acquiring other complementary products, technologies or businesses. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and\nexpensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control.\nConsequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions once undertaken and announced, will close.\nIf we merge with or acquire another company following the Business Combination, it is reasonably expected that there will be increased operating expenses and costs associated\nwith the merger that could negatively impact operating profits in the future periods immediately following the M&A event. The extent and longevity of those impacts is not\npossible to quantify.\nThese kinds of acquisitions or investments may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. If we acquire businesses or technologies, we may not be able to\nintegrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the\nanticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n• inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies, products, personnel or services in a profitable manner;\n• unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition, including potential liabilities due to litigation and potential identified or unknown security\nvulnerabilities in acquired technologies that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our offerings or recognize the\nbenefits of our investment;\n• differences between our values and those of an acquired company, as well as potential disruptions to our workplace culture;\n• incurrence of acquisition-related costs, including costs related to integration activities;\n24\nTable of Contents\n• difficulty integrating the accounting and information systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n• augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation;\n• difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n• challenges converting the acquired company’s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including subscription-based revenues and\nsoftware license revenues;\n• potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n• difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms;\n• diversion of management’s attention and other company resources;\n• harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n• the potential loss of key employees;\n• use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n• use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nWe cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities or risks.\nIntegrating an acquired technology, asset or business into our operations can be challenging, complex and costly and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that the\nanticipated benefits of the acquisitions that we complete will be realized or outweigh their costs. If our integration and development efforts are not successful and the anticipated\nbenefits of the acquisitions that we complete are not achieved, our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders, use cash that we may need in the future to operate\nour business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business\ncultures and values, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges. These challenges could adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nMaterial adverse developments in domestic and global economic conditions, or the occurrence of other world events, could materially adversely affect Airship AI’s revenue\nand results of operations.\nVarious factors contribute to the uncertain economic environment, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the increase in, and volatility of, interest rates, high inflation, an\nactual recession or fears of a recession, trade policies and tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Our inability to offset price inflation in our materials, components, shipping, or labor\nthrough increased prices to customers with long-term fixed contracts and formula-based or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Global supply chain and labor market challenges could also negatively affect our performance as well as the performance of our\nsuppliers. Interest rate increases have also created financial market volatility and could further negatively impact financial markets, lead to an economic downturn or recession\nor have an adverse effect on our operating results. Economic slowdowns can also negatively impact municipal and state tax collections and put pressure on law enforcement\nbudgets which may increase the risk that our customers will be unable to appropriate funds for existing or future contracts with us. In addition, geopolitical risks could affect our\ncustomers’ budgets and policies. These and other factors may adversely affect customer demand and ability to pay, cause decrease in sales, and negatively impact the\nrealizability of our accounts and notes receivable and contract assets.\n25\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophic events could materially adversely affect Airship AI’s business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident,\nutility failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, public health crisis, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing\nother mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm\nour ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.\nIf our backup and mitigation plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected. We are continuously monitoring our\noperations and intend to take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks arising from catastrophic events, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so.\nIf Airship AI fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting, Airship AI’s ability to report its financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner could be adversely affected, investor\nconfidence in Airship AI company could diminish, and the value of its stock may decline.\nPreparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and\nrequire significant management judgment. One or more of these processes may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement or other\nerrors of our consolidated financial statements. Such errors may be more likely to occur when implementing new systems and processes, particularly when implementing\nevolving and complex accounting rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires, among other things, that as a publicly-traded company we\ndisclose whether our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we continually undertake steps to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as our business changes, we may not be successful in making the improvements and changes necessary to be able to identify and remediate\ncontrol deficiencies or material weaknesses on a timely basis. If we are unable to successfully remediate any current or future material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness\nmay be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements and debt instruments covenants regarding the\ntimely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; we may suffer defaults\nunder our debt instruments; and our stock price may decline.\nChanges in accounting principles or their application to Airship AI could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, which could adversely affect its results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In particular, we make certain estimates and assumptions related to the adoption and interpretation\nof these principles including the recognition of our revenue and the accounting for our provision for income taxes. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, our financial\nresults and position could materially differ from our expectations and could be materially adversely affected. A change in any of these principles or guidance, or in their\ninterpretations or application to us, may have a significant effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously\nreported results or our forecasts, which may negatively impact our financial statements.\nIf Airship AI’s judgments or estimates relating to its critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, Airship AI’s results of\noperations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in its stock price.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Airship AI”\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions,\nwhich could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of the combined\ncompany’s securities. Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, or may in the future include, those\nrelated to revenue recognition and income taxes.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAirship AI has limited insurance which may not cover claims by third parties against Airship AI or its officers and directors.\nWe have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and commercial liability insurance policies. Claims, however, by third parties against us may exceed policy amounts and we\nmay not have amounts to cover these claims. Any significant claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In\naddition, our limited directors’ and officers’ liability insurance may affect our ability to attract and retain directors and officers.\nAirship AI could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining our provision for income taxes requires significant\nmanagement judgment, and the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain. In addition, our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by\nmany factors, including, among other things, changes to our operating or holding structure, changes in the amounts of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates,\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws. Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns\nby tax authorities in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which may disagree with our calculation of research and development tax credits, cross-jurisdictional\ntransfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes, interest or penalties. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes and we believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover any such contingencies, there can be no assurance\nthat the outcomes of such examinations will not have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax\nlaws, our overall taxes could increase, and our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nUnder the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and benefits from, net operating losses may be limited in certain circumstances, including a change in control. Section 382\nof the Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a\ncorporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards in\nthe future.\nProvisions enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, all U.S. and non-U.S. based R&E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five years and 15 years, respectively.\nCosts incurred in the development of software programs for Airship AI’s products are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility of the software has been\nestablished. Generally, technological feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary functions described in its original specifications, contains features\nrequired for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete. After technological feasibility is\nestablished, any additional costs are capitalized. Capitalization of software costs ceases when the software is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use. No\nsoftware development costs have been capitalized during the years ended or as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nCurrently, our Common Stock and Public Warrants are listed on Nasdaq. However, there may not be enough liquidity in such market to enable stockholders to sell their\nsecurities.\n27\nTable of Contents\nCurrently, our Common Stock and Public Warrants are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market, respectively. If a public market for our securities\ndoes not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell their Common Stock or Warrants, rendering their securities illiquid and possibly resulting in a complete loss of their\ninvestment. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. The trading price of and demand for the\nCommon Stock and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the Common Stock will depend on a number of conditions, including the\ndevelopment of a market following, including by analysts and other investment professionals, the businesses, operations, results, and prospects of the Company, general market\nand economic conditions, governmental actions, regulatory considerations, legal proceedings, and developments or other factors. These and other factors may impair the\ndevelopment of a liquid market and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the Common\nStock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the price and liquidity of the\nCommon Stock. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of the Company or the stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors exercise significant control over us, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in\ncorporate control.\nVictor Huang, Airship AI’s co-Founder and our Chief Executive Officer, and Derek Xu, Airship AI’s co-Founder and our Chief Operating Officer, beneficially own (including\nshares underlying outstanding warrants, stock options and SARs) approximately 70.5% of our combined voting power. As a result, these stockholders will be able to influence\nour management and affairs and control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese stockholders may have interests, with respect to their Common Stock, which are different from those of the public investors and the concentration of voting power among\none or more of these stockholders may have an adverse effect on the price of the Common Stock.\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock by: (1) delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control; (2)\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or (3) discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of us.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain the Company’s resources and distract management and we will incur substantial costs as a result of being a public\ncompany.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the\nSecurities Act. These rules, regulations and requirements are extensive. We will incur significant costs associated with our public company corporate governance and reporting\nrequirements. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-\nOxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if\nrequired, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight\nmay be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may\nneed to hire more corporate employees to comply with these requirements or engage outside consultants, which would increase our costs and expenses. This may divert\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These\napplicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and it may be required to accept reduced\npolicy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified\nindividuals to serve on the Board or as executive officers.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to\ntheir lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in\ncontinuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to\ncomply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time\nand attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by\nregulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may\nbe adversely affected.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this annual report and in the filings that we are required to make as a public company, our business, operating results and financial\ncondition have become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If any such claims are successful, our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the\ntime and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of a substantial amount of Common Stock in the public market, particularly sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders, or the perception\nthat these sales could occur, could cause the market price of Common Stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock in the public market, particularly sales by our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, or the\nperception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of Common Stock to decline. Some of our executive officers, directors and the holders of a substantial\nnumber of shares of Common Stock are subject to lock-up provisions in our Bylaws in that, for a period of at least six months from the date of closing of the Business\nCombination, subject to certain exceptions, prohibit them from offering for sale, selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of, transferring or otherwise\ndisposing of any shares of Common Stock and of any securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, unless waived, amended, or repealed by the Board.\nWhen the applicable lock-up periods expire, our security holders subject to lock-up provisions will be able to sell shares of Common Stock in the public market. In addition, the\nBoard may, in its discretion, permit our security holders to sell shares prior to the expiration of the restrictive provisions contained in the Bylaws. Sales of a substantial number\nof such shares upon expiration of the lock-up provisions, the perception that such sales may occur or early release of these provisions could cause our market price to fall or\nmake it more difficult for you to sell your shares of Common Stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nIn addition, we may file a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nvesting requirements and expiration of the lock-up provisions referred to above, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options would be available for immediate\nresale in the open market.\nA decline in the price of Common Stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of Common Stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of the Common Stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in\nthe price of Common Stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity, operations and strategic plans. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned\nuses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and services and continue current operations.\nIf our Common Stock’s price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our\nobligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business, our Common Stock price and trading\nvolume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and\nindustry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our Common\nStock would likely be negatively affected. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or\npublish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish\nreports on us, demand for our Common Stock could decrease, which might cause the share price and trading volume to decline.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our capital stock must come from increases in the fair\nmarket value and trading price of the capital stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on Common Stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future\nearnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Any credit agreements which we may enter into with institutional lenders, may restrict our\nability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of\noperations, capital requirements and any other factors that the Board decides is relevant. Therefore, any return on your investment in our capital stock must come from increases\nin the fair market value and trading price of the capital stock.\nThe market price of our equity securities may be volatile, and you could lose a significant part of your investment.\nThe stock markets, including the Nasdaq, on which certain of our securities are listed, have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Even if an\nactive, liquid and orderly trading market develops and is sustained for the Common Stock and our Public Warrants, the market price of the Common Stock and our Public\nWarrants may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nOn March 29, 2024, the last reported sales price of our Common Stock was $6.45. The exercise price of the Public Warrants is higher than the current market price of our\nCommon Stock and accordingly, Public Warrant holders may not be able to exercise their Public Warrants at this time. Cash proceeds associated with the exercises of the\nPublic Warrants (and our other outstanding warrants) are dependent on our stock price and given the recent price volatility of our Common Stock and relative lack of liquidity\nin our stock, we may not receive any cash proceeds in relation to our outstanding warrants. In addition, the trading volume in our Common Stock and our Public Warrants may\nfluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of the Common Stock and our Public Warrants will not fluctuate widely or\ndecline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, among others, the following:\n• the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this annual report;\n• the concentration of the ownership of our shares by a limited number of affiliated stockholders may limit interest in our securities;\n• limited “public float” with a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for the\nCommon Stock;\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• loss of a strategic relationship;\n• variations in operating results from the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n• announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n• reductions in the market share of our products;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n• investor perception of our industry or prospects;\n• insider selling or buying;\n• investors entering into short sale contracts;\n• regulatory developments affecting our industry;\n• changes in our industry;\n• competitive pricing pressures;\n30\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n• our ability to execute our business plan;\n• operating results that fall below expectations;\n• revisions in securities analysts’ estimates or reductions in security analysts’ coverage; and\n• economic and other external factors.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of the Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any\npredictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for the Common Stock will be at any time, including as to whether the Common Stock will sustain current\nmarket prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of the Common Stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price. In addition, the\nsecurities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These\nmarket fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this\ntype of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could\nseriously harm our business.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less\nthan $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current\nprice and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If our common stock is no longer listed on a national\nsecurities exchange such as Nasdaq and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock may be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a\nbroker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special\nwritten determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure\nstatement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may\nhave the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” and “emerging growth company” under the U.S. federal securities laws, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to\nsmaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” and an “emerging growth company” under U.S. federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we\nmay take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Furthermore, as an emerging growth company, we may take\nadvantage of exemptions from certain reporting requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. Investors may not find our common stock attractive\nbecause we may rely on these exemptions and reduced disclosures. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market\nfor our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million\nas of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates\nexceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, (b) in which we\nhave total annual gross revenue of at least $1.23 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that\nis held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in\nnon-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Charter and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable,\nincluding:\n• the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting\nrights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n• the right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a\ndirector, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors or the chairman of the board of directors, which could delay\nthe ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\nWe are also subject other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. Any of the foregoing\nprovisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of\nCommon Stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain\nstockholder litigation matters, which could limit stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or\nstockholders.\nOur Charter requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary\nduty and other similar actions may be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another federal or state court\nsituated in the State of Delaware. These provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other\nclaim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed\nto have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the Charter. In addition, our Charter and bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, claims made\nunder the Securities Act must be brought in federal district court.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers,\nother employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. Alternatively, if a court\nwere to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving\nsuch action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY.\nAirship’s cybersecurity and risk management program is intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical information systems and the data\nresided on them. Due to the nature of our business and our customers, we face various cybersecurity challenges and threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to\nour codebase, proprietary or confidential information, denial-of-service attacks, attacks from foreign nations, as well as threats to our identity and personnel. We have designed\nour IT systems and processes with the intention that our solutions should defend against the ever-evolving threat landscape while remaining agile to keep up with such threats.\nAirship leverages a combination of the NIST Cyber Security Framework alongside the CMMC framework to protect its assets and secure our supply chain for our customers.\nWe use the controls from these frameworks as well as guidelines and best practices from the industry to develop our cybersecurity plan. Our cybersecurity plan and its elements\nare reviewed regularly to ensure they meet the requirements and expectations of our security needs.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAirship’s cybersecurity program is spearheaded by their cybersecurity department with approval from executive management. The stakeholders have been identified and know\ntheir roles within the cyber security process as well as having all roles be documented.\nRisk is assessed based on multiple factors. First, our IT team updates and maintains our asset inventory to ensure all assets are included in our risk management process. From\nthere, key assets are identified, and risk is assessed based on business impact, availability of information, and attack feasibility. After the risks have been identified, they are\nreviewed with the stakeholders for action plans or sign-off on the acceptance of risk.\nAirship leverages third party applications and software to help identify vulnerabilities within our system’s boundaries. These vulnerability lists are used to create remediation\nplans and are prioritized based on severity and attack feasibility.\nThe Company performs security awareness training with its employees. Our security policy is also provided to employees upon employment providing them with the rules and\npolicies to follow so that proper security practices are understood and performed.\nAn incident response plan has been established which provides detailed information on actions to take in the event of an incident. The incident response plan includes the scope\nof the plan, establishes the incident response team, details the incident response lifecycle, and provides templates to make the process easier to document and follow. Timelines,\ncommunication methods, and notification information are included in the plan to ensure the process can be followed in high pressure situations which can occur during\nincidents.\nBusiness continuity and disaster recovery plans are also a part of our cybersecurity process. Ensuring data continuity in times of disaster or other incidents is important so that\nproper security is followed in times of impact to our business. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plan includes a list of items that are essential to our business along\nwith RTO and RPO information. The plan lists what each employee in the plan is responsible for and provides contact information.\nSensitive and confidential data is a part of business. Airship leverages an encryption and signing policy that identifies the type of information Airship stores and what level of\nencryption and signing is required for the data. This document also details the overarching requirements for encryption such as allowed cyphers, encryption methods, and key\nstorage.\nAirship has had one cybersecurity incident in the last decade. The Company was the victim of a ransomware virus that encrypted several machines on Airship’s corporate\nnetwork. The threat was quickly identified and isolated before significant damage could be done. The attack did not affect business operations and did not have a significant\nfinancial impact on the Company. Most files affected had backup and Airship was able to remove affected files and restore them from backup.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOn July 13, 2023, we entered into a lease in Redmond, WA for 15,567 square feet of office and warehouse space which started on October 1, 2023. The monthly payment is\n$25,000 per month.

The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nSee Item 12 “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.”\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 532,945 shares of common stock to Roth Capital Partners LLC, in\nsatisfaction of fees payable to Roth Capital Partners LLC for financial services and placement agent duties provided to Airship AI in connection with the Business Combination.\nThis issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2).\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company issued in a private placement the Platinum Convertible Note to Platinum in the principal amount of $2,000,000 (the “Platinum Convertible\nNote”). At the option of Platinum, the principal amount of the Platinum Convertible Note plus any accrued but unpaid interest is convertible into shares of Common Stock at a\nconversion price per share equal to the lower of (i) $3.69717, subject to appropriate adjustment as provided in the Platinum Convertible Note, and (ii) 65% of the VWAP for the\nCommon Stock for the preceding five trading days immediately prior to any conversion, but in no event below $2.27518, subject to appropriate adjustment as provided in the\nPlatinum Convertible Note.

The term of the Platinum Warrant expires on June 22, 2028. These securities were offered and sold in\nreliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements under Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.\nDescription of Securities\nAuthorized and Outstanding Stock\nWe are a Delaware company and our affairs are governed by our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the\n“DGCL” or “Delaware Law” below, and the common law of the State of Delaware. The Charter authorizes the issuance of 205,000,000 shares, consisting of 200,000,000 shares\nof Common Stock 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).\n34\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 22,812,048 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nVoting rights. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders\ngenerally are entitled to vote. The holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Generally, all matters to be voted on by\nstockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders present in person or\nrepresented by proxy, voting together as a single class.\nDividend Rights. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such\ndividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board out of funds legally available for such purposes.\nLiquidation Rights. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to\nshare ratably in all assets remaining after payment of the Company’s debts and other liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of Preferred Stock or any class or series of\nstock having a preference over the Common Stock, then outstanding, if any.\nOther rights. The holders of Common Stock have no pre-emptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions\napplicable to the Common Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of the Common Stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of the Preferred\nStock that the Company may issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nThere are no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Charter authorizes the Board to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock. Unless required by law or any\nstock exchange, the authorized shares of Preferred Stock will be available for issuance without further action by the holders of Common Stock. The Board has the discretion to\ndetermine the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges\nand liquidation preferences, of each series of Preferred Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of\nthe Company without further action by the stockholders. Additionally, the issuance of Preferred Stock may adversely affect the holders of Common Stock by restricting\ndividends on the Common Stock, diluting the voting power of the Common Stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of the Common Stock. As a result of these or other\nfactors, the issuance of Preferred Stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of the Common Stock, restricting dividends on the Company’s capital stock, diluting\nthe voting power of Common Stock, impairing the liquidation rights of the Company’s capital stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. At present,\nthere are no plans to issue any Preferred Stock.\nWarrants\nPublic Warrants\nEach whole Public Warrant will entitle the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at\nany time commencing 30 days after the Closing, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on\na cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the Warrant Agreement) and such shares of Common Stock are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the\nsecurities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its Public Warrants only for a whole\nnumber of shares of Common Stock. This means only a whole Public Warrants may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. The Public Warrants will expire five years\nafter the Closing, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant\nexercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus\nrelating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No Public Warrants will be exercisable and the Company will\nnot be obligated to issue a share of Common Stock upon exercise of a Public Warrant unless the Common Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered,\nqualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two\nimmediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public Warrant, the holder of such Public Warrant will not be entitled to exercise such Public Warrant and\nsuch Public Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any Public Warrant.\nThe Company is registering the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants in a registration statement on Form S-1. In order to comply with the requirements\nof Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act following the Closing, under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event\nlater than 15 business days, after the Closing, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a new registration statement covering the\nregistration under the Securities Act of the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and thereafter the Company will use its best efforts to cause the same\nto become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment or registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration\nor redemption of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement. If such post-effective amendment or registration statement covering the\nCommon Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the Closing, warrant holders may, until such time as there\nis an effective post-effective amendment or registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,\nexercise Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Common Stock\nis at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of\nthe Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)\n(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the\nCompany does not so elect, the Company will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In\nsuch event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Public Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) over the exercise price of the Public Warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361. The “fair market value” as used in this paragraph shall mean the average\nreported closing price of the Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and\n• if, and only if, the closing price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20\ntrading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (which we refer to as the\n“Reference Value”).\nThe Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Common Stock\nissuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption\nperiod. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying\nsecurities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant\nexercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its\nPublic Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Common Stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for\nadjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the\n$11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.10 per warrant;\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, provided that holders will be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis prior to\nredemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table below, based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) of Common Stock except as otherwise described below;\n• if, and only if, the Reference Value equals or exceeds $10.00 per Public Share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise) or the\nexercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”; and\n• if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share, the Private Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding\nPublic Warrants, as described above.\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the Public Warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless\nbasis. The numbers in the table below represent the number of shares of Common Stock that a warrant holder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, based on the “fair market value” of Common Stock on the corresponding redemption date (assuming holders elect to\nexercise their Public Warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on the volume weighted average price of the\nCommon Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, and the number of months that\nthe corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the warrants, each as set forth in the table below. the Company will provide warrant holders with the final fair\nmarket value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\nThe share prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Public Warrant or\nthe exercise price of a Public Warrant is adjusted as set forth under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below. If the number of shares issuable upon exercise of Public\nWarrants is adjusted, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator\nof which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a Public Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the number of shares\ndeliverable upon exercise of a Public Warrant as so adjusted. The number of shares in the table below shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the number\nof shares issuable upon exercise of a Public Warrant. If the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted, (a) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the fifth paragraph under the\nheading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the unadjusted share price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price as set forth under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” and the denominator of which is $10.00 and\n(b) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the second paragraph under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will\nequal the unadjusted share price less the decrease in the exercise price of a warrant pursuant to such exercise price adjustment.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRedemption Date (period to expiration of Fair Market Value of Common Stock\nwarrants) ≤10.00 11.00 12.00 13.00 14.00 15.00 16.00 17.00 ≥18.00\n60 months 0.261 0.281 0.297 0.311 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n57 months 0.257 0.277 0.294 0.310 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n54 months 0.252 0.272 0.291 0.307 0.322 0.335 0.347 0.357 0.361\n51 months 0.246 0.268 0.287 0.304 0.320 0.333 0.346 0.357 0.361\n48 months 0.241 0.263 0.283 0.301 0.317 0.332 0.344 0.356 0.361\n45 months 0.235 0.258 0.279 0.298 0.315 0.330 0.343 0.356 0.361\n42 months 0.228 0.252 0.274 0.294 0.312 0.328 0.342 0.355 0.361\n39 months 0.221 0.246 0.269 0.290 0.309 0.325 0.340 0.354 0.361\n36 months 0.213 0.239 0.263 0.285 0.305 0.323 0.339 0.353 0.361\n33 months 0.205 0.232 0.257 0.280 0.301 0.320 0.337 0.352 0.361\n30 months 0.196 0.224 0.250 0.274 0.297 0.316 0.335 0.351 0.361\n27 months 0.185 0.214 0.242 0.268 0.291 0.313 0.332 0.350 0.361\n24 months 0.173 0.204 0.233 0.260 0.285 0.308 0.329 0.348 0.361\n21 months 0.161 0.193 0.223 0.252 0.279 0.304 0.326 0.347 0.361\n18 months 0.146 0.179 0.211 0.242 0.271 0.298 0.322 0.345 0.361\n15 months 0.130 0.164 0.197 0.230 0.262 0.291 0.317 0.342 0.361\n12 months 0.111 0.146 0.181 0.216 0.250 0.282 0.312 0.339 0.361\n9 months 0.090 0.125 0.162 0.199 0.237 0.272 0.305 0.336 0.361\n6 months 0.065 0.099 0.137 0.178 0.219 0.259 0.296 0.331 0.361\n3 months 0.034 0.065 0.104 0.150 0.197 0.243 0.286 0.326 0.361\n0 months — — 0.042 0.115 0.179 0.233 0.281 0.323 0.361\nThe exact fair market value and redemption date may not be set forth in the table above, in which case, if the fair market value is between two values in the table or the\nredemption date is between two redemption dates in the table, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued for each Public Warrant exercised will be determined by a\nstraight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower fair market values and the earlier and later redemption dates, as applicable, based on a\n365 or 366-day year, as applicable. For example, if the volume weighted average price of Common Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which\nthe notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $11.00 per share, and at such time there are 57 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose\nto, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.277 shares of Common Stock for each whole warrant. For an example where the exact fair market\nvalue and redemption date are not as set forth in the table above, if the volume weighted average price of Common Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the\ndate on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $13.50 per share, and at such time there are 38 months until the expiration of the warrants,\nholders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.298 shares of Common Stock for each whole warrant. In no event will the Public\nWarrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 shares of Common Stock per warrant (subject to adjustment).\nFinally, as reflected in the table above, if the Public Warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they cannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for any shares of Common Stock.\nThis redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding Public Warrants to be redeemed when the Common Stock is trading at or above $10.00 per share, which\nmay be at a time when the trading price of the Common Stock is below the exercise price of the Public Warrants. We have established this redemption feature to provide us with\nthe flexibility to redeem the Public Warrants without the Public Warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under “— Redemption of Public\nWarrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to exercise their Public Warrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to\nthis feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input as of the date of the prospectus. This\nredemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and therefore have certainty as to our capital structure as the\nwarrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed and we will be required to pay the applicable redemption price to warrant holders if we\nchoose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the Public Warrants if we determine it is in our best interest to do so. As\nsuch, we would redeem the Public Warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the warrants and pay the applicable\nredemption price to the warrant holders.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAs stated above, we can redeem the Public Warrants when the Common Stock is trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below the exercise price of $11.50, because it will\nprovide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing warrant holders with the opportunity to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless\nbasis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to redeem the Public Warrants when the Common Stock is trading at a price below the exercise price of the Public\nWarrants, this could result in the warrant holders receiving fewer shares than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to exercise their warrants for shares of\nCommon Stock if and when the Common Stock was trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.\nNo fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down\nto the nearest whole number of the number of shares to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the Public Warrants are exercisable for a security other than shares\nof Common Stock pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the Public Warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as the Public Warrants become exercisable for a\nsecurity other than Common Stock, Airship Pubco (or the surviving company) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act the security\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants.\nRedemption Procedures\nIn the event that the Company determines to redeem the Public Warrants when the closing price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share or $10.00\nper share, pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of the Warrant Agreement, respectively, the Company will fix a date for the redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed\nby first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date to the registered holders of the Public Warrants to be redeemed at\ntheir last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or\nnot the registered holder received such notice.\nBeneficial Ownership Limitations\nA holder of a Public Warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the\nextent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of\n4.9% or 9.8% (as specified by the holder) of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.\nAnti-dilution Adjustments. If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased by a share capitalization payable in shares of Common Stock, or by a sub-\ndivision of shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization, sub-division or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable\non exercise of each Public Warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of\nsecurities entitling holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a share capitalization of a number of shares equal to\nthe product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are\nconvertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) and (ii) the quotient of (x) the price per share of Common Stock paid in such rights offering and (y) the fair market value.\nFor these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, in determining the price payable for Common Stock, there will be\ntaken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume\nweighted average price of Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Common\nStock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\nIn addition, if the Company, at any time while the Public Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to all\nor substantially all of the holders of the Common Stock on account of such Common Stock (or other securities into which the Public Warrants are convertible), other than (a) as\ndescribed above or (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid on the\nCommon Stock during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution does not exceed $0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any other\nadjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price or to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on\nexercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, then the warrant\nexercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets\npaid on each share of Common Stock in respect of such event.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share sub-division or reclassification of Common Stock or other\nsimilar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share sub-division, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Common\nStock issuable on exercise of each Public Warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nWhenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be\nadjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares purchasable upon\nthe exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such\nshares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and\nthat does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another\ncorporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the Public\nWarrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Public Warrants and in lieu of the Common\nStock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares or other securities or property\n(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the\nPublic Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their Public Warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a\nright of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other\nassets for which each Public Warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such\nconsolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders under\ncircumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)\n(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the\nExchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the\nExchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, the holder of a Public Warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or\nother property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrant holder had exercised the Public Warrant prior to the expiration of such\ntender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Common Stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to\nadjustment (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the Warrant Agreement. If\nless than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Common Stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of shares in the successor entity that is listed for\ntrading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and\nif the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced\nas specified in the Warrant Agreement based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price\nreduction is to provide additional value to holders of the Public Warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the Public Warrants pursuant to\nwhich the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the Public Warrants.\nThe Public Warrants are issued in registered form under a Warrant Agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and BYTS. The\nWarrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or to correct\nany defective provision or mistake, including to conform the provisions of the Warrant Agreement to the description of the terms of the Public Warrants and the Warrant\nAgreement, (ii) adjusting the provisions relating to cash dividends on shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the Warrant Agreement or (iii) adding or changing any\nprovisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Warrant Agreement as the parties to the Warrant Agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the\nparties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the Public Warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-\noutstanding Public Warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of Public Warrants, and, solely with respect to any\namendment to the terms of the Private Warrants, 50% of the then outstanding Private Warrants. You should review a copy of the Warrant Agreement, which is filed as an\nexhibit to the annual report, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the Public Warrants.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe Public Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on\nthe reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by\ncertified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of shares of\nCommon Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Common Stock. After the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of\nthe Public Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. If, upon exercise of the Public Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a\nshare, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the warrant holder.\nExclusive Forum\nThe Warrant Agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement,\nincluding under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any\nobjection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the Warrant Agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any\ninterest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of\nwhich is within the scope the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction\nof the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement\naction”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as\nagent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes, which may discourage such lawsuits\nand result in increased costs to warrant holders to bring a lawsuit. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Warrant Agreement inapplicable or unenforceable\nwith respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and\nboard.\nPrivate Warrants\nThe Private Warrants (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the Closing\n(except, among other limited exceptions, to BYTS’ officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor) and they will not be redeemable by the\nCompany so long as they are held by the Sponsor, members of the Sponsor or their permitted transferees (except as set forth under “— Warrants — Public\nWarrants — Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00”). The Sponsor or its permitted transferees have the option to\nexercise the Private Warrants on a cashless basis. Except as described below, the Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as\npart of the Units in BYTS’ IPO. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the\nCompany and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in BYTS’s IPO.\n41\nTable of Contents\nExcept as described above under “— Public Warrants — Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00,” if holders of the\nPrivate Warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Common\nStock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the Private Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of\nthe Common Stock (as defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” means the average reported closing price of\nthe Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that\nwe have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees is because it was not known at the\ntime of the IPO whether the Sponsor would be affiliated with us following a business combination. If the Sponsor remains affiliated with the Company, its ability to sell the\nCompany’s securities in the open market will be significantly limited. The Company has policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling securities except during specific\nperiods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell the Company’s securities, an insider cannot trade in the Company’s securities if he or\nshe is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their Public Warrants and sell the shares received upon such\nexercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on Common Stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future\nearnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Board and will\nbe dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and any other factors that the Board decides is relevant. If we incur any indebtedness, our\nability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nOur Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent\nThe transfer agent for the Common Stock and warrant agent for the Warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Its address is 1 State Street, 30th Floor, New\nYork, New York 10004, and its telephone number is (212) 509-4000.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Charter, the Bylaws and Certain Provisions of Delaware Law\nThe Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL contain provisions, which are summarized in the following paragraphs, which are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and\nstability in the composition of the Board and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of the Company. These provisions\nare intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce the Company’s vulnerability to a hostile change of control or other unsolicited acquisition proposal, and enhance the ability\nof the Board to maximize stockholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire the Company. However, these provisions may have the effect of delaying,\ndeterring or preventing a merger or acquisition of the Company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its\nbest interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of Common Stock. The Charter provides that, from and after the\ndate the Company ceases to qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq listing standards, any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company’s\nstockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders, except that any\naction required or permitted to be taken by holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such series, may\nbe taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, to the extent expressly permitted to do so by the certificate of designation relating to one or more series of\nPreferred Stock, if a consent or consents, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant class or series having not less than the\nminimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and are\ndelivered to the Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. See also “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Securities — Anti-takeover provisions\ncontained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair a takeover attempt”.\nAuthorized but Unissued Capital Stock\nDelaware law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. However, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, which would apply if and so long as the\nCommon Stock remains listed on Nasdaq, require stockholder approval of certain issuances equal to or exceeding 20% of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding\nnumber of shares of Common Stock. Additional shares that may be issued in the future may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings, to\nraise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions. One of the effects of the existence of unissued and unreserved capital stock may be to enable the Board to issue shares to\npersons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender\noffer, proxy contest or otherwise and thereby protect the continuity of management and possibly deprive stockholders of opportunities to sell their shares of Common Stock at\nprices higher than prevailing market prices.\n42\nTable of Contents\nElection of Directors and Vacancies\nThe Charter provides that the Board will determine the number of directors who will serve on the board. The exact number of directors will be fixed from time to time by a\nmajority of the Board. The Board is declassified and consists of one class of directors only, and all directors will be elected annually and will be elected for one year terms\nexpiring at the next annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders. There will be no limit on the number of terms a director may serve on the Board.\nIn addition, the Charter provides that any vacancy on the Board, including a vacancy that results from an increase in the number of directors or a vacancy that results from the\nremoval of a director with cause, may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, subject to any rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.\nQuorum\nThe Bylaws provide that at any meeting of the Board, a majority of the total number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nUnder Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation expressly authorizes cumulative voting. The Charter does not authorize\ncumulative voting.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nThe Charter provides that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive\nOfficer or President, in each case, in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Meetings, Nominations and Proposals\nThe Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made\nby or at the direction of the Board or a committee of the Board. For any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice\nrequirements and provide the Company with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received at the Company’s principal executive offices\nnot less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The Bylaws allow the Board to\nadopt rules and regulations for the conduct of a meeting of the stockholders as it deems appropriate, which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a\nmeeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may also defer, delay or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect\nthe acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to influence or obtain control of the Company.\nSupermajority Provisions\nThe Charter and the Bylaws provide that the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, the Bylaws without a stockholder vote in any matter\nnot inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or the Charter. The Company’s stockholders also will have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in an election of\ndirectors, voting together as a single class, subject to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company required by applicable law or by the Charter\n(including any certificate of designation in respect of any series of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws.\nThe DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, is required to amend a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation, unless the certificate of incorporation requires a greater percentage. The Charter provides that the following provisions therein may be\namended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 and 2/3% in voting power all the then outstanding shares of the Company’s\nstock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class:\n43\nTable of Contents\n• the provision regarding the Board being authorized to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock with such powers, preferences and relative, participating,\noptional and other special rights, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences as the Board may\ndetermine;\n• the provisions regarding removal of directors;\n• the provisions regarding filling vacancies on the Board and newly created directorships;\n• the provision regarding the Board being authorized to amend the Bylaws without a stockholder vote;\n• the provisions regarding calling special meetings of stockholders;\n• the provisions regarding stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of other business proposed to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of\nthe stockholders;\n• the provisions regarding limitation on liability and indemnification of the Company’s directors and officers;\n• the provisions regarding the Company electing not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL;\n• the provisions adopting Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation and adopting the federal district courts of the United States as the\nexclusive forum for resolving complaints asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act;\n• the provisions regarding the Company renouncing its interest or expectancy in any corporate opportunity offered to any of its non-employee directors or principal\nstockholders and their affiliates; and\n• the amendment provision requiring that the above provisions be amended only with a 66 and 2/3% supermajority vote.\nThese provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of the Company or its management, such as a merger,\nreorganization or tender offer. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of the Board and its policies and to discourage\ncertain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of the Company. These provisions are designed to reduce the Company’s vulnerability to an\nunsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect\nof discouraging others from making tender offers for Common Stock and, as a consequence, may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of Common Stock that could result\nfrom actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in management.\nExclusive Forum\nThe Charter provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the\nCourt of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the\nfederal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following\nclaims or causes of action under the Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action, suit or\nproceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s\nstockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the DGCL or the Charter or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), (iv) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or\ndetermine the validity of the Charter or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder), (v) any action, suit or\nproceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Chancery Court, or (vi) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or\nformer director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine or otherwise related to the Company’s internal affairs, in all cases to the\nfullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. To the fullest extent permitted by law,\nany person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the\nforum provisions in the Charter. The Charter further provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted\nby law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThis provision in the Charter will not apply to any claim or action arising under the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have\nexclusive jurisdiction; however, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nExchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. However, it is possible that a court could find the Company’s forum selection provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. Although the Company believes this provision will benefit the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of\nlawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company’s directors and officers.\n44\nTable of Contents\nConflicts of Interest\nDelaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented to the corporation or its officers,\ndirectors or stockholders. The Charter, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Delaware law, renounces any interest or expectancy that the Company has in, or\nright to be offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities that are from time to time presented to a member of the Board who is not an employee of the\nCompany or its subsidiaries, or the principal stockholders of the Company and their affiliates. The Charter does not renounce the Company’s interest in any business\nopportunity that is expressly offered to a non-employee director solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’\nfiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. The Charter includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors and officers for monetary damages for any\nbreach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of these\nprovisions is to eliminate the rights of the Company and its stockholders, through stockholders’ derivative suits on the Company’s behalf, to recover monetary damages from a\ndirector or officer for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any\ndirector or officer if the director or officer has acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an improper\nbenefit from his or her actions as a director or officer.\nThe limitation of liability provision in the Charter and the Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors or officers for breach of their fiduciary\nduty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might\notherwise benefit the Company and its stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent the Company pays the costs of settlement and damage\nawards against directors and officers pursuant to any indemnity agreements that may be entered into. The Company believes that this provision, liability insurance and any\nindemnity agreements that may be entered into are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced directors and officers.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to the Company’s directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is,\ntherefore, unenforceable.\nThere is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of the Company’s respective directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.\n45\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6. Reserved\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement which is summarized in Note 13— Reverse Recapitalization, of the audited consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition,\nliquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the\nrelated notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions\nmade by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a\nresult of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements.”\nOverview\nWe are a robust AI-driven data management platform that solves complex data challenges for large institutions operating in dynamic and mission-critical environments with\nrapidly increasing volumes of data being ingested from a similarly rapidly growing number of data sources.\nWe solve these challenges by structuring “dark” or unstructured data at the edge, the location at which the data is generated and collected, and leveraging purpose-built AI\nmodels. Unstructured, or “dark” data, which is typically categorized as qualitative data, cannot be processed and analyzed via conventional data tools and methods. Conversely,\nstructured data, typically categorized as quantitative data, is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms.\nStructuring and then analyzing data using AI models at the edge, versus transmitting the data from the edge back to a central processing location for structuring and analysis,\nenables real-time decision making and data-driven operational efficiency.\nWe specialize in ingesting all available metadata from edge-based sensors used by government and law enforcement agencies around the world, including surveillance cameras\n(video), audio, telemetry, acoustic, seismic, and autonomous devices, along with large commercial corporations with fundamentally similar capabilities and requirements.\nData generated by these edge-based sensors, including video, can then be run through our trained AI models to detect objects present within the video frame. Once an object is\ndetected, for example an automobile, additional identifying characteristics of the object can be extracted from the image including the license plate characters and the make,\nmodel, and color of the automobile. This process of analyzing, logging and categorizing ingested data is referred to as “structuring” the data.\nAirship AI’s software allows customers to view structured data both in real-time as well as to conduct searches on the structured data at a later point in time. Real-time\nstructured data use includes, for example, alarms on a specific license plate or a specific make, model or color of automobile. Non-real-time structured data use includes, for\nexample, searching a database of video data that has been previously ingested and stored to find instances of a particular license plate being visible, along with other logged\nvehicle characteristics such as make, model and color of an automobile.\nAdditional edge deployed AI models enable similar object detection and recognition of common and custom trained objects, such as an aircraft, boat, person, animal, bag, or\nweapon. Airship AI’s models provide similar data points for these object types allowing analysts the ability to be notified in real-time of the detection of a specified object and\nsimilarly search for historically detected objects. Examples include detecting aircrafts and boats along with their respective tail numbers and hull registration numbers.\nOur AI modelling process starts with pre-trained AI models from our technology ecosystem partners which we then customize using proprietary datasets tailored towards our\ncustomers unique workflow requirements. Where customers have pre-existing AI models or engines, we integrate those models or engines into our edge platform allowing\ncustomers to leverage proprietary models within the Airship AI software ecosystem.\nOur primary offerings include Outpost AI, Acropolis, and Airship Command. Our offerings allow customers to manage their data across the full data lifecycle, when and where\nthey need it, using a highly secure permissioned based architecture.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\nOn June 27, 2023, BYTS entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among BYTS, Merger Sub, and Airship AI. The Merger Agreement was amended on September 22, 2023.\nOn December 21, 2023, the Merger with BYTS closed. Airship AI Holdings, Inc. became the accounting acquiror and the combined entity became the successor SEC registrant\nunder the ticker symbol “AISP”.\nKey Performance Indicators\nHistorically, a majority of our product revenue has consisted primarily of a bundled hardware and software product and to date we have sold or licensed a minimal amount of\nstandalone software. In the future, we expect to see more delivery of our products using a cloud based software solution which will allow us to create additional subscription\nrevenue.\nWe have historically evaluated our business solely based on revenue generated from customers and we have not tracked any other customer-related metrics. As we grow and\nincrease our product offerings and customer base, we intend to modify and develop more advanced performance indicators. We believe the following key performance\nindicators apply to us in the future:\n· Growth within existing government customers. While we currently have a strong footprint across multiple large U.S. government agencies, growing our business\nwithin these agencies outside of the investigation focused departments is a fundamental area of our projected growth. Our ability to expand our footprint by\nimplementing AI based solutions that leverage our core existing competencies within the agencies will be a critical indicator of the success of this strategy. We\nwill measure progress against this objective through the disclosure of awards for new business within these agencies during the affected timeframe, providing\ntangible evidence of the success of our strategy to both management and investors alike.\n· Greater penetration into the commercial marketplace. While we have several existing customers in the commercial marketplace, our ability to build on the\nsolutions we provide those customers and expand that base will be critical to our projected growth objectives. We will measure progress against this objective\nthrough the disclosure of the number of new commercial customers added during the affected timeframe, providing tangible evidence of the success of our\nstrategy to both management and investors alike.\n· Expansion of our edge AI based solutions. We began to sell AI based solutions in late 2022. Our current strategy is highly focused on the transition of data\nmanagement and analysis workloads to the edge, driving efficiency and cost savings for our customers. This strategy also includes new models being trained to\nextract data at the edge which enables real-time intelligent decision making for our customers. We will measure progress against this objective through the\ndisclosure of the numbers of edge AI hardware devices we are selling as well as the growth of our edge AI analytic capabilities, providing tangible evidence of the\nsuccess of our strategy to both management and investors alike.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nWe believe the following factors and trends may cause previously reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial\nconditions:\n· Increase in the sales of lower margin solutions as we expand our operational footprint. While our current focus remains on expanding our AI driven software\napplication portfolio, opportunities will continue to present themselves to provide those software-based solutions as part of a larger hardware-based turn-key\nsolutions where Airship AI can provide a unique value-add to the customer. While these solutions will positively affect revenue we anticipate our operating profits\nin future periods may be adversely affected as compared to previous years due to the lower operating margin for hardware versus software applications.\n· Challenges due to geo-political driven supply-chain constraints. While many of the COVID-19 driven supply chain issues have been resolved, challenges to the\ntimely production and delivery of Taiwan based products we utilize for our edge AI platform due to geo-political factors is a concern looking forward. In the event\nthat our suppliers are unable to provide timely delivery of those supplies it will significantly impact our ability to meet delivery schedules for existing and\nanticipated edge AI hardware-based solutions.\n· Near-term impacts due to merger and acquisition activity. If Airship AI merges with or acquires another company following the Business Combination, it is\nreasonably expected that there will be increased operating expenses and costs associated with the merger that could negatively impact operating profits in the future\nperiods immediately following the M&A event. The extent and longevity of those impacts is not possible to quantify.\n47\nTable of Contents\nSegment Reporting\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected\ninformation about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and\nservices the Company offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is\ndeveloped each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss to the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Variance % Variance\nNet revenues $ 12,300 $ 14,549 $ (2,249) -15.5%\nCost of net revenues 6,536 6,128 (408) -6.7%\nGross profit 5,764 8,421 (2,657) -31.6%\nResearch and development expenses 2,729 3,615 886 24.5%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,675 7,630 (2,045) -26.8%\nTotal operating expenses 12,404 11,245 (1,159) -10.3%\nOperating loss (6,640) (2,824) (3,816) -135.1%\nOther income (expense):\nGain from change in fair value of warrants 1,341 - 1,341 100.0%\nGain from change in fair value of earnout liability 21,977 - 21,977 100.0%\nLoss from change in fair value of convertible debt (241) - (241) -100.0%\nInterest income - 43 (43) -100.0%\nInterest expense (56) (75) 19 25.3%\nOther expense (10) - (10) -100.0%\nOther income- PPP loan forgiveness - 1,146 (1,146) -100.0%\nOther income- Employee retention tax credit - 1,233 (1,233) -100.0%\nTotal other income, net 23,011 2,347 20,664 880.4%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 16,371 (477) 16,848 3532.1%\nIncome tax benefit (expense) - (10) 10 100.0%\nNet income (loss) $ 16,371 $ (487) $ 16,858 3461.6%\nNet Revenues — Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $2,249,000 to $12,300,000 as compared to $14,549,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as a\nresult of lower product sales. We have also recently received purchase orders from various government agency customers totaling over $13 million from which we expect to\nstart receiving cash in the first quarter of 2024. As a result of supply chain issues that existed at December 31, 2021, we were unable to fulfill many orders and had a backlog of\nnew orders of $6.8 million that shipped during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCost of Net Revenues — Cost of net revenues primarily consists of product costs and post customer support. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales increased\n$408,000 to $6,536,000 as compared to $6,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to higher product costs and increased post contract support\ncosts.\nResearch and Development Expenses — Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $886,000 to $2,729,000 as compared to\n$3,615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to reduced personnel (17 personnel as compared to 18 personnel) and reduced funding of $694,000 of\nthe AI expenses in Taiwan.\n48\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses — Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $2,045,000 to $9,675,000 as\ncompared to $7,630,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to (i) increased stock based compensation of $2,305,000; and offset by (iii) reduced other\nexpenses of $260,000. The stock based compensation increase includes $2,100,000 for warrants to purchase 1,344,951 shares of common stock issued to each of Victor Huang\nand Derek Xu.\nOther Income — Other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $23,011,000 as compared to other income of $2,347,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of (i) gain from change in fair value of warrant liability of $1,341,000; (ii) gain from change in fair value of\nearnout liability of $21,977,000; and offset by (iii) unrealized loss for increase in fair value of convertible promissory note of $241,000 and (iv) noncash interest and other, net\nof $66,000.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to (i) gain on forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1,146,000 and (ii) $1,233,000 income\nfrom employee retention tax credit.\nNet Income (Loss) — Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $16,371,000 as compared to net loss of $487,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nchange was the result of $2.7 million lower gross profit in 2023 from decreased revenue and higher cost of revenue, higher operating expenses in 2023 of $1.2 million due\nmostly to increased stock based compensation offset by $20.6 million increase in other income as discussed in other income above. The net income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 included noncash income of $19,627,000. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 included net noncash expenses of $50,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant\nfactors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. We formally evaluated\nour liquidity and cash position most recently in March 2024 when preparing our December 31, 2023 audited financial statements. During this process we concluded, based upon\nexisting assets and liabilities, our order backlog and projections, plus the ability to borrow up to $2.5 million in short term loans from our founder, that we would be able to\noperate at least for the next twelve months. We have also recently received purchase orders from various government agency customers totaling over $13 million from which\nwe expect to start receiving cash in the first quarter of 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $3,124,000 and net capital deficit of approximately $6,174,000. The net working capital deficit includes a couple of\nitems that are expected to require limited future cash outlays including current portion of deferred revenue totaling $4,009,000 and convertible debt totaling $2,825,000 which\nwe expect to be converted to equity. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $16,582,000. On December 21, 2023, the merger with BYTS closed from\nwhich we received $2.8 million in net proceeds. Airship AI Holdings, Inc. became the accounting acquiror.\na. Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,291,000. This amount was primarily related to (i) net income of $16,371,000; (ii)\ndepreciation of $15,000; (iii) stock based compensation of $2,852,000; (iv) net amortization of operating lease right of use asset of $597,000; (v) unrealized loss for increase in\nfair value of convertible promissory note of $240,000; (vi) non cash interest, net of $65,000; offset by (vii) gain from change in fair value of warrant liability of $1,341,000;\n(viii) gain from change in fair value of earnout liability of $21,976,000; and (ix) working capital changes of $36,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2,903,000. This amount was primarily related to (i) a net loss of $487,000; (ii) working capital\nchanges of $2,365,000; (iii) gain on forgiveness of note payable — PPP of $1,146,000; offset by (iv) depreciation of $15,000; (v) stock based compensation of $546,000; (vi)\namortization of operating lease right of use asset of $517,000; and (vii) other of $17,000.\nb. Financing Activities\n49\nTable of Contents\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6,120,000 and consisted of (i) issuance of a senior secured convertible promissory note of\n$2,585,000; (ii) net advances provided by the founders of $1,150,000; (iii) proceeds from reverse capitalization of $2,800,000; and offset by (iv) the payoff of small business\nloan and line of credit of $425,000.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,866,000 and consisted of (i) $565,000 from a small business loan and a line of credit;\n(ii) proceeds from notes receivable — related parties of $842,000; (iii) the founders advances of $1,900,000 and repayment of advances to the founders of $1,300,000; and\n(iv) repayment of small business loan and line of credit of $140,000.\nOur contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2023 (excluding debt financing arrangements below) are summarized in the table below:\nLess Than\nContractual Cash Obligations Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years\nOperating lease cash payments $ 1,291,754 $ 245,051 $ 729,919 $ 316,784\nDebt Financing Arrangements\nOn June 22, 2023, we entered into a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Platinum Capital Partners Inc. and received $2,000,000. As a condition of funding, we\npaid off three small notes and accounts payable totaling $374,000. At the option of the holder, the note is convertible into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and\nstock. We expect the convertible debt to be converted to equity.\nOn November 2 2023, we issued senior secured convertible promissory notes for $600,000 to two private investors. At the option of the holders, the notes are convertible into\ncash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. On March 5, 2024, the two private investors converted the debt to equity.\nMr. Huang has committed to providing $2.5 million in additional temporary funding if it is necessary.\n50\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that our cash on hand, funding from the completion of the business combination, results of operations and financing transactions will be sufficient to fund our\noperations for the next twelve months.\nEquity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing\nis not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our\noperations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOn July 13, 2023, we entered into a lease in Redmond, WA for 15,567 square feet of office and warehouse space which started October 1, 2023. The monthly payment is\n$25,000 per month. The lease expires October 31, 2027 and the monthly payment increases 3% on July 31, 2024 and each year thereafter. There is a one three year option to\nextend based on the fair market rate on October 31, 2027.\nOn February 29, 2024, we extended a lease in Moorestown, North Carolina. The Company leases 3,621 square feet and the net monthly payment is $6,488. The lease expires on\nJuly 29, 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect\non our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could\ndiffer materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be affected.\n51\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the significant accounting policies described in “Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements are\naccurate and complete. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are\ndescribed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and post contract support (“PCS”) services. Our products and PCS offerings\nhave significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, the products are distinct from our PCS services as customers can benefit from the products without the\nPCS services and such PCS services are separately identifiable within the contracts. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the\ncontractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount of\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nWe establish the standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past\ntransactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and offering type (products or PCS services). As our business offerings evolve over time, we\nmay be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for all future benefits including, but not\nlimited to, net operating losses, research and development credit carryforwards, and basis differences with certain assets and liabilities.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all\navailable evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our\ndetermination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision or benefit for\nincome taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of\navailable evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The\nsecond step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We do not believe that\nwe currently have any material uncertain tax positions and no reserves are currently required given our deferred tax asset has a 100% valuation allowance.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options, warrants, SARs, unvested earnout shares and other equity-based compensation using\nthe Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation and Monte Carlo valuation models for estimating fair value of such equity instruments. The fair value of such equity instruments is\ndetermined at the date of grant and such value is recognized as an expense over the service period of the recipient. The Black Scholes and Monte Carlo pricing model uses\nvarious inputs and assumptions, including the estimated fair value of the common stock, stock volatility, risk free interest rate over the expected term of the instrument,\nestimated life of the award, and forfeiture rates of such awards. All of these estimates impact stock based compensation which is a non-cash expense. Changes in the\nassumptions used in the calculation would impact the recorded stock based compensation. The fair value of the equity instrument is usually calculated at issuance and is not\nrequired to be remeasured in the future. Management uses third party experts to assist with certain elements of the fair value calculation and it constantly adjusts the variables\nused in estimating the fair value of equity instruments issued as compensation.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on\nobservable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an\nentity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\n52\nTable of Contents\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 —Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 —Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and\naccrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and\nliabilities. The Company recorded its Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note, earnout liability, Private Warrants and the warrants that were issued with this Note at fair\nvalue, remeasured on a recurring basis.\nThe Company classifies as liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net- cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event\nis outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information on recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded herein.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe full text of our audited consolidated financial statements begins on page F-1 of this annual report and is included herein by reference.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nThere is no information to report pursuant to Item 304(b) of Regulation S-K. That information required by Item 304(b) of Regulation S-K was previously reported under Item\n4.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 28, 2023.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange\nAct”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers concluded as of December 31, 2023 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we completed the Business Combination on December 21, 2023. Prior to the Business Combination, our predecessor, Byte\nAcquisition Corp., was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,\nreorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. As a result, Byte’s previously existing internal controls are no longer applicable or\ncomprehensive enough as of the assessment date as Byte’s liabilities and operations prior to the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated\nentity post-Business Combination. The design of our internal controls over financial reporting post-Business Combination has required and will continue to require significant\ntime and resources from management and other personnel. As a result, management was unable, without incurring unreasonable effort or expense, to conduct an assessment of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we are excluding management’s report on internal control over financial reporting pursuant\nto Section 215.02 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance’s Regulation S-K Compliance & Disclosure Interpretations.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nSince the Merger and until December 31, 2023, there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, which were identified in connection with our\nmanagement’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material effect\non our internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified\nabove. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain\njudgments and assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Rover have been detected\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.\nWe have no information to disclose that was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 but was not reported.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 10.

Officers serve at the discretion of the Board.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no family relationships among any of our officers or directors.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, except as described below, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:\n· been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);\n· had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a\ngeneral partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;\n· been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority,\npermanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities,\ninvestment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;\n· been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to\nhave violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n· been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated\n(not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or\nregulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order\nof disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation\nprohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n· been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section\n3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or\nany equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe Board’s Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Company’s business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of five directors, including three independent directors, namely Amit\nMital, Peeyush Ranjan and Louis Lebedin. A director is not required to hold any shares in the Company to qualify as a director.\nThe Board has extensive involvement in the oversight of risk management related to the Company and its business and will accomplish this oversight through the regular\nreporting to the Board by the audit committee. The audit committee represents the Board by periodically reviewing the Company’s accounting, reporting and financial practices,\nincluding the integrity of its financial statements, the surveillance of administrative and financial controls and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Through\nits regular meetings with management, including the finance, legal, internal audit and information technology functions, the audit committee reviews and discusses all\nsignificant areas of the Company’s business and summarize for the Board all areas of risk and the appropriate mitigating factors. In addition, the Board receives periodic\ndetailed operating performance reviews from management.\nControlled Company Exemption\nVictor Huang, Airship AI’s co-Founder and our Chief Executive Officer, and Derek Xu, Airship AI’s co-Founder and our Chief Operating Officer, beneficially own (including\nshares underlying warrants, stock options and SARs) approximately 70.5% of the combined voting power for the election of directors to the Board, and, as a result, the\nCompany is considered a “controlled company” for the purposes of Nasdaq listing rules. For so long as the Company remains as a controlled company under that definition, it is\npermitted to elect to rely on certain exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including that a majority of the Company consist of “independent directors,” as\ndefined under Nasdaq listing rules. In addition, the Company is not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee or compensation committee that is\ncomposed entirely of independent directors with written charters addressing the committees’ purposes and responsibilities and an annual performance evaluation of these\ncommittees.\nIf at any time the Company ceases to be a “controlled company” under Nasdaq listing rules, the Board intends to take any action that may be necessary to comply with Nasdaq\nlisting rules, subject to a permitted “phase-in” period.\nBoard Meetings and Committees\nDuring our last fiscal year, each of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of Board meetings and (ii) the total number of meetings of the\ncommittees on which the director served.\nIndependent Directors\nNasdaq rules generally require that independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors. Based upon information requested from and\nprovided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, the Company has determined that Peeyush Ranjan,\nLouis Lebedin, and Amit Mital, representing three of the Company’s five directors, are “independent” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, which have the responsibilities and authority\nnecessary to comply with applicable Nasdaq and SEC rules. The Board may from time to time establish other committees.\nThe Company’s chief executive officer and other executive officers will regularly report to the non-executive directors and the audit, the compensation and the nominating and\ncorporate governance committees to ensure effective and efficient oversight of the Company’s activities and to assist in proper risk management and the ongoing evaluation of\nmanagement controls. We believe that the leadership structure of the Board will provide appropriate risk oversight of the Company’s activities.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAudit Committee\nAmit Mital, Peeyush Ranjan and Louis Lebedin serve as members of the audit committee of the Company (the “Audit Committee”), with Mr. Mital serving as the chairperson.\nEach of the members of the Audit Committee satisfies all independence requirements under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. Our Board has\ndetermined that Louis Lebedin possesses accounting or related financial management experience that qualifies him as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the\nrules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq.\nThe Audit Committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements. The Audit Committee is generally responsible for,\namong other things:\n• appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;\n• reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;\n• discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;\n• reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken to monitor and control major\nfinancial risk exposures;\n• reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions as defined by applicable law or Nasdaq listing requirements;\n• meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors; and\n• monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our procedures to ensure proper\ncompliance.\nCompensation Committee\nPeeyush Ranjan and Amit Mital serve as members of the compensation committee of the Company (the “Compensation Committee”), with Mr. Ranjan serving as the\nchairperson.

The Compensation\nCommittee is generally responsible for, among other things:\n• reviewing and approving the corporate goals and objectives applicable to the compensation of the chief executive officer, evaluating the chief executive officer’s\nperformance, and determining and approving the chief executive officer’s compensation level based on this evaluation;\n• reviewing and approving the compensation of all other Executive Officers;\n• reviewing, approving and recommending incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans to the Board and stockholders of the Company for approval, and\nadministering the Company’s incentive compensation plans, equity-based plans and the clawback policy;\n• reviewing, approving and recommending employment agreements and severance arrangements or plans to the Board for approval;\n• reviewing all Director compensation and benefits for service on the Board and Board committees, and recommending any changes to the Board as necessary; and\n• overseeing, in conjunction with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, engagement with stockholders and proxy advisory firms on executive\ncompensation matters.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nPeeyush Ranjan and Amit Mital serve as members of the nominating and governance committee of the Company (the “Nominating and Governance Committee”), with Mr.\nRanjan serving as the chairperson.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee is generally responsible for identifying and proposing new potential director nominees to the Board for consideration and for\nreviewing our corporate governance policies. The Nominating and Governance Committee is generally responsible for, among other things:\n• determining the qualifications, qualities, skills, and other expertise required to be a director, and developing and recommending to the Board the criteria to be\nconsidered in selecting director nominees for the Board’s approval;\n• identifying and screening individuals qualified to become members of the Board, and considering any director candidates recommended by the Company’s\nstockholders;\n• selecting and approving the director nominees to be submitted to a stockholder vote at the stockholders’ annual meeting, subject to approval by the Board;\n• developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company, reviewing these principles and recommending\nany changes to the Board;\n• overseeing the Company’s corporate governance practices and procedures, including identifying best practices, and reviewing and recommending to the Board for\napproval any changes to the documents, policies and procedures in the Company’s corporate governance framework;\n• reviewing the Board’s committee structure and composition and to make recommendations to the Board annually regarding the appointment of directors to serve\nas members of each committee and committee chairmen;\n• if a vacancy on the Board and/or any Board committee occurs, identifying and making recommendations to the Board regarding the selection and approval of\ncandidates to fill such vacancy either by election by stockholders or appointment by the Board;\n• developing and overseeing a Company orientation program for new Directors and a continuing education program for current Directors, periodically reviewing\nthese programs and updating them as necessary;\n• reviewing and discussing with management disclosure of the Company’s corporate governance practices;\n• developing and recommending to the Board for approval an officer succession plan, to review such succession plan periodically with the chief executive officer,\ndeveloping and evaluating potential candidates for executive positions, and recommending to the Board any changes to and any candidates for succession under\nthe succession plan.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Company has adopted code of business conduct that applies to all of its directors, officers and employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial\nofficer and principal accounting officer. The Company’s code of business conduct is a “code of ethics,” as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. Please note that the\nCompany’s Internet website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The Company will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or\nwaivers of, provisions of its code of ethics on its Internet website.\nCommunication with our Board of Directors\nOur stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with our Board of Directors by sending written communication in an envelope addressed to “Board of\nDirectors” in care of the Secretary, 8210 154th Avenue NE, Suite 120,\nRedmond WA 98052.\n59\nTable of Contents\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nOur executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders are required under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the\nSEC. Copies of these reports must also be furnished to us.\nBased solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, and on written representations by our officers and directors regarding their compliance with the\napplicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, we believe that, with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all such reports were filed\ntimely.\nITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.\nThis section discusses the material components of the executive compensation program for (i) the individual who served as our principal executive officer during fiscal years\n2023 and 2022; and (ii) our next two most highly compensated executive officers who earned more than $100,000 during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and were serving as\nexecutive officers as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. We refer to these individuals as our “named executive officers.”\nThis discussion may contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation\nprograms. Actual compensation programs that we adopt following the Business Combination may differ materially from the currently planned programs summarized in this\ndiscussion.

As of December\n31, 2023, 1,758,105 shares were vested. These shares were valued at $0.11 per share, or $190,000, as of the date of grant. On January 16, 2018, Mr. Huang received\n1,758,105 stock appreciation rights for past service.

Of these options,\n467,528 vested immediately, 233,765 vested on December 31, 2022 and 233,765 vested on December 31, 2023. These options were valued at grant date Black-Scholes\nvalue of $1.35 per share, or $1,270,078.\nExecutive Compensation Arrangements\nOther than the annual compensation, bonus and equity incentive awards described above and below, the Company has no other executive compensation, change in control or\nsimilar agreements or arrangements.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mark E. Scott, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, which provides for a base salary of\n$250,000 annually. Mr. Scott is also eligible to participate in annual performance-based bonus programs established by the Board or Compensation Committee, subject to the\nachievement of applicable performance criteria established by the Board or Compensation Committee, which shall be determined in good faith by the Board or Compensation\nCommittee. Mr. Scott was also granted options to purchase up to Twenty Five Thousand (25,000) shares of Common Stock with an exercise price equal to $1.49, which options\nvested in full on the date of issuance.\n2022 Combined Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan\nRelated to the Share Exchange Agreement with Super Simple AI, Inc., on February 17, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Combined Incentive and\nNon-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the “2022 Plan”) to issue options to acquire a maximum of 3,000,000 common stock shares. Effective upon the Closing, the 2022 Plan will no\nlonger be available for use for the grant of future awards. The 2022 Plan will continue to govern the terms of awards that have been granted under the 2022 Plan before, and that\nare still outstanding following, the Merger.\nThe 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including options that are intended to qualify as “incentive stock options” under Section 422 of the Code, as well as non-\nqualified stock options. Each award is set forth in a separate agreement with the person who received the award which indicates the type, terms and conditions of the award.\n61\nTable of Contents\nCertain Transactions\nIf as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in our capital stock, the outstanding shares of\ncommon stock are increased or decreased or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company without the receipt of consideration by\nthe Company, or, if, as a result of any merger or consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the outstanding shares are converted into or\nexchanged for other securities of the Company. or any successor entity, the administrator shall make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of\nshares reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan, (ii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding awards under the 2022 Plan, (iii) the\nrepurchase price, if any, per share subject to each outstanding award, and (iv) the exercise price for each share subject to any then outstanding options under the 2022 Plan.\nAmendment and Termination\nOur board of directors may terminate or amend the 2022 Plan at any time, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding award without the holder’s\nconsent. However, we must generally obtain stockholder approval for any such amendments to the extent required by applicable law. The administrator may exercise its\ndiscretion to reduce the exercise price of outstanding stock options to the then current fair market value if the fair market value of the common stock covered by such option has\ndeclined since the date the option was granted, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, each outstanding option under the 2022 Plan that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into (i) an option\n(each, a “Converted Stock Option”), on substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, to\npurchase the number of shares of Common Stock, determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock subject to such award as of immediately prior to the\nEffective Time by the Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to (A) the exercise price per share of common stock of such award divided by\n(B) the Conversion Ratio, and (ii) the right to receive a number of Earnout Shares in accordance with, and subject to, the contingencies set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nStock Appreciation Rights Plan\nRelated to the Share Exchange Agreement with Super Simple AI, Inc., on February 17, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Stock Appreciation Rights\nPlan (the “SAR Plan”) to issue a maximum of 1,500,000, which was later adjusted to 2,637,150 stock appreciation rights (“SAR”) after the Merger.\nAs of December 31, 2023, after adjusting for the Merger, there were 1,758,105 SARs outstanding with a base value of $0.12 and January 2028 expiration.\nPayment of Appreciation Amount\nThe appreciation distribution in respect to a SAR may be paid in cash, in common stock of the Company, in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration,\nas determined by the Board and contained in the stock appreciation rights agreement evidencing such SAR.\nAmendment and Termination\nOur board of directors may terminate or amend the SAR Plan at any time, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding award without the holder’s\nconsent.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, each SAR granted under the SAR Plan that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into a stock appreciation\nright denominated in shares of Common Stock (each, a “Converted SAR”). Each Converted SAR will continue to have and be subject to substantially the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Converted SAR will cover that number of shares of Common Stock\nequal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of common stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Conversion Ratio and (B) a\nnumber of Earnout Shares in accordance with, and subject to, the contingencies set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the per share base value for each share of Common\nStock covered by the Converted SAR will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the base value per share of common stock of such SAR immediately prior to the\nEffective Time by (B) the Conversion Ratio.\n62\nTable of Contents\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company has adopted the Equity Incentive Plan, which plan was approved by stockholders at the extraordinary general meeting. This section summarizes certain principal\nfeatures of the Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe Equity Incentive Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which the Company can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to its officers,\nemployees, directors, consultants and advisers. The purpose of the Equity Incentive Plan is to help the Company attract, motivate and retain such persons with awards under the\nEquity Incentive Plan and thereby enhance shareholder value.\nAdministration. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Board, and upon consummation of the Merger will be administered by the compensation committee of the\nBoard, which shall consist of three members of the Board, each of whom is a “non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act\nand “independent” for purposes of any applicable listing requirements. If a member of the compensation committee is eligible to receive an award under the Equity Incentive\nPlan, such compensation committee member shall have no authority under the plan with respect to his or her own award. Among other things, the compensation committee has\ncomplete discretion, subject to the express limits of the Equity Incentive Plan, to determine the directors, employees and nonemployee consultants to be granted an award, the\ntype of award to be granted the terms and conditions of the award, the form of payment to be made and/or the number of shares of common stock subject to each award, the\nexercise price of each option and base price of each stock appreciation right (“SAR”), the term of each award, the vesting schedule for an award, whether to accelerate vesting,\nthe value of the common stock underlying the award, and the required withholding, if any. The compensation committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding\naward, provided that the participant’s consent to such action is required if the action would impair the participant’s rights or entitlements with respect to that award. The\ncompensation committee is also authorized to construe the award agreements, and may prescribe rules relating to the Equity Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\ncompensation committee does not have any authority to grant or modify an award under the Equity Incentive Plan with terms or conditions that would cause the grant, vesting\nor exercise thereof to be considered nonqualified “deferred compensation” subject to Code Section 409A, unless such award is structured to be exempt from or comply with all\nrequirements of Code Section 409A.\nGrant of Awards; Shares Available for Awards. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, SARs, performance share awards, performance unit awards,\ndistribution equivalent right awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and unrestricted stock awards to non-employee directors, officers, employees and\nnonemployee consultants of the Company or its affiliates. The aggregate number of shares of common stock initially reserved and available for grant and issuance under the\nEquity Incentive Plan is 4,000,000. Such aggregate number of shares of stock will automatically increase on January 1 of each year for a period of ten years commencing on\nJanuary 1, 2024 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2033, in an amount equal to 2.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the\npreceding year; provided, however, that the Board may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of\ncommon stock. No more than 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan in connection with incentive stock options.\nShares shall be deemed to have been issued under the Equity Incentive Plan solely to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an award. If any award granted under\nthe Equity Incentive Plan expires, is cancelled, or terminates unexercised or is forfeited, the number of shares subject thereto is again available for grant under the Equity\nIncentive Plan, other than any shares tendered or withheld in order to exercise or satisfy withholding obligation in respect of any award. The Equity Incentive Plan shall\ncontinue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board.\nFollowing the Closing, it is expected that all of our employees, consultants, advisors and service providers and all of our non-executive officer directors will be eligible to\nparticipate in the Equity Incentive Plan. Future new hires and additional non-employee directors and/or consultants would be eligible to participate in the Equity Incentive Plan\nas well. The number of stock options and/or shares of restricted stock to be granted to executives and directors cannot be determined at this time as the grant of stock options\nand/or shares of restricted stock is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation Limit. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for a limit on non-employee director compensation. The maximum number of shares of stock\nthat may be subject to an award granted under the Equity Incentive Plan during any single fiscal year to any non-employee director, when taken together with any cash fees paid\nto such non-employee director during such year in respect of his or her service as a non-employee director (including service as a member or chair of any committee of the\nboard), shall not exceed $250,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such award based on the fair market value on the date of grant of such award for financial reporting\npurposes).\n63\nTable of Contents\nStock Options. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of either “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”), which are intended to meet the requirements for special federal\nincome tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, or “nonqualified stock options” (“NQSOs”). Stock options may be granted on such terms and conditions as the\ncompensation committee may determine, which shall be specified in the option agreement; provided, however, that the per share exercise price under a stock option may not be\nless than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of the stock option may not exceed 10 years (110% of such value and five years in\nthe case of an ISO granted to an employee who owns (or is deemed to own) more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of our company or\na parent or subsidiary of our company). ISOs may only be granted to employees. In addition, the aggregate fair market value of common stock covered by one or more ISOs\n(determined at the time of grant), which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Any excess is treated as a NQSO.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A SAR entitles the participant, upon exercise, to receive an amount, in cash or stock or a combination thereof, equal to the increase in the fair market\nvalue of the underlying common stock between the date of grant and the date of exercise. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable SAR award agreement\nthe terms and conditions of the SAR, including the base value for the SAR (which shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date of grant), the number of\nshares subject to the SAR and the period during which the SAR may be exercised and any other special rules and/or requirements which the compensation committee imposes\non the SAR. No SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of grant. SARs may be granted in tandem with, or independently of, stock options\ngranted under the Equity Incentive Plan. A SAR granted in tandem with a stock option (i) is exercisable only at such times, and to the extent, that the related stock option is\nexercisable in accordance with the procedure for exercise of the related stock option; (ii) terminates upon termination or exercise of the related stock option (likewise, the\ncommon stock option granted in tandem with a SAR terminates upon exercise of the SAR); (iii) is transferable only with the related stock option; and (iv) if the related stock\noption is an ISO, may be exercised only when the value of the stock subject to the stock option exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. A SAR that is not granted in\ntandem with a stock option is exercisable at such times as the compensation committee may specify.\nPerformance Shares and Performance Unit Awards. Performance share and performance unit awards entitle the participant to receive cash or shares of common stock upon the\nattainment of specified performance goals. In the case of performance units, the right to acquire the units is denominated in cash values. The compensation committee shall set\nforth in the applicable award agreement the performance goals and objectives and the period of time to which such goals and objectives shall apply. If such goals and objectives\nare achieved, such distribution of shares, or payment in cash, as the case may be, shall be made no later than by the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month next\nfollowing the end of the company’s fiscal year to which such performance goals and objectives relate, unless otherwise structured to comply with Code Section 409A.\nDistribution Equivalent Right Awards. A distribution equivalent right award entitles the participant to receive bookkeeping credits, cash payments and/or common stock\ndistributions equal in amount to the distributions that would have been made to the participant had the participant held a specified number of shares of common stock during the\nperiod the participant held the distribution equivalent right. A distribution equivalent right may be awarded as a component of another award (but not an option or SAR award)\nunder the Equity Incentive Plan, where, if so awarded, such distribution equivalent right will expire or be forfeited by the participant under the same conditions as under such\nother award. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable distribution equivalent rights award agreement the terms and conditions, if any, including whether the\nholder is to receive credits currently in cash, is to have such credits reinvested (at fair market value determined as of the date of reinvestment) in additional shares of common\nstock, or is to be entitled to choose among such alternatives.\nRestricted Stock Awards. A restricted stock award is a grant or sale of common stock to the holder, subject to such restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other\nrestrictions, if any, as the compensation committee or the board of directors may impose, which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such\ncircumstances (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), in such instalments or otherwise, as the compensation committee or\nthe board of directors may determine at the date of grant or purchase or thereafter. If provided for under the restricted stock award agreement, a participant who is granted or\nhas purchased restricted stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the restricted stock and the right to receive dividends thereon (subject to\nany mandatory reinvestment or other requirement imposed by the compensation committee or the board of directors or in the award agreement). During the restricted period\napplicable to the restricted stock, subject to certain exceptions, the restricted stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of by\nthe participant.\n64\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards. A restricted stock unit award provides for a grant of shares or a cash payment to be made to the holder upon the satisfaction of predetermined\nindividual service-related vesting requirements, based on the number of units awarded to the holder. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable restricted\nstock unit award agreement the individual service-based vesting requirements which the holder would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled to payment\nand the number of units awarded to the holder. The holder of a restricted stock unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of\ncommon stock, or one share of common stock, as determined in the sole discretion of the compensation committee and as set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement,\nfor each restricted stock unit subject to such restricted stock unit award, if and to the extent the holder satisfies the applicable vesting requirements. Such payment or distribution\nshall be made no later than by the fifteenth (15th ) day of the third (3rd) calendar month next following the end of the calendar year in which the restricted stock unit first\nbecomes vested, unless otherwise structured to comply with Code Section 409A. A restricted stock unit shall not constitute an equity interest in the company and shall not\nentitle the holder to voting rights, dividends or any other rights associated with ownership of shares prior to the time the holder shall receive a distribution of shares.\nUnrestricted Stock Awards. An unrestricted stock award is a grant or sale of shares of common stock to the employees, non-employee directors or non-employee consultants\nthat are not subject to transfer, forfeiture or other restrictions, in consideration for past services rendered to the company or an affiliate or for other valid consideration.\nAdjustment to Shares. Subject to any required action by shareholders of the company, the number of shares of common stock covered by each outstanding award shall be\nproportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares, including, but not limited to, a stock\nsplit, reverse stock split, recapitalization, continuation or reclassification, or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the stock) or any other increase or decrease in the\nnumber of such shares effected without receipt of consideration by the company.\nChange-in-Control Provisions. The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, at the time an award is granted or at any time prior to, coincident with or after the time\nof a change in control, cause any award either (i) to be cancelled in consideration of a payment in cash or other consideration in amount per share equal to the excess, if any, of\nthe price or implied price per share of common stock in the change in control over the per share exercise, base or purchase price of such award, which may be paid immediately\nor over the vesting schedule of the award; (ii) to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such surviving\ncorporation following such change in control; (iii) accelerate any time periods, or waive any other conditions, relating to the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an\naward so that any award to a holder whose employment has been terminated as a result of a change in control may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a\ndate fixed by the compensation committee; (iv) to be purchased from a holder whose employment has been terminated as a result of a change of control, upon the holder’s\nrequest, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such award been currently\nexercisable or payable; or (v) terminate any then outstanding award or make any other adjustment to the awards then outstanding as the compensation committee deems\nnecessary or appropriate to reflect such transaction or change. The number of shares subject to any award shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nTransferability. No award may be assigned, transferred, sold, exchanged, encumbered, pledged or otherwise hypothecated or disposed of by a holder except by will or by the\nlaws of descent and distribution, or by gift to any immediate family member of the holder, subject to compliance with applicable laws.\nAmendment and Termination. The compensation committee may adopt, amend and rescind rules relating to the administration of the Equity Incentive Plan, and amend, suspend\nor terminate the Equity Incentive Plan, but no such amendment or termination will be made that materially and adversely impairs the rights of any participant with respect to\nany award received thereby under the Equity Incentive Plan without the participant’s consent, other than amendments that are necessary to permit the granting of awards in\ncompliance with applicable laws. In addition, no amendment that results (directly or indirectly ) in the reduction of the exercise price of an option or SAR or that otherwise\nrequires shareholder approval under applicable law will be made without shareholder approval.\nDirector Compensation\nWe primarily use monthly fees and stock option grants to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. This compensation reflected the financial condition of the\nCompany. In setting director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill-\nlevel required by our members of the Board. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Victor Huang and Derek Xu did not receive any compensation for their services as\ndirectors. The compensation disclosed in the “Summary Compensation Table” above represents the total compensation for Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu.\n65\nTable of Contents\nOur independent non-employee directors are compensated in cash and stock option grants.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 3, 2023 regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our Common Stock by:\n● each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of our voting securities;\n● each of our current executive officers and directors; and\n● all executive officers and directors of the Company as a group.\nPercentage of beneficial ownership of Common Stock is based on 22,812,048 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this report.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect to, or the power to receive the economic\nbenefit of ownership of, the securities.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged\nto perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Organization\nOn March 7, 2023, the Company changed its name to Airship AI Holdings, Inc. from Super Simple AI, Inc. Airship AI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Airship”) is a\nholding company that executes business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Airship AI, Inc. Prior to the formation of Super Simple AI, Inc. in 2022, the Company operated as\nAirship AI, Inc. (formerly known as JDL Digital Systems, Inc.) Super Simple AI, Inc. was formed in January 2022 through a share exchange with JDL Digital System. JDL\nDigital Systems, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on June 30, 2003.\nThe Company has historically enabled government and commercial customers, through a combination of hardware, software, including artificial intelligence (“AI”) and service\nofferings to manage existing and emerging physical security challenges through a secure single-pane-of-glass Common Operational Picture (COP), connecting a wide range of\nsensors and edge Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices across disparate networks, environments, and geographic locations to a single consolidated location.\nThe Company employed forty seven employees as of December 31, 2023. The employees are headquartered in Redmond, WA and are supported by a growing team at our\nCustomer Center of Excellence located in Charlotte, NC. The Company employed eight research and development personnel in Taiwan as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s products appeal to customers whose business operations are geographically diverse, providing essential goods and services, requiring physical security solutions\nthat are tailored to their unique physical security requirements. Airship further appeals to customers who want to choose the right tool for the job (or tailor the tool to fit the job),\nrather than have to operate based on the tools that are commercially available to them.\nThe Company has historically promoted its goods and services through very select marketing and advertising channels, most of which are closed to the general public and or are\nlimited in their focus to customers specifically looking for solutions in the physical security and video surveillance arena.\nThe Company’s initial software application is now further evolving into an enterprise grade solution addressing a broadened data management lifecycle, starting at the edge.\nEdge Cloud Computing is being increasingly viewed as a key enabler and technology necessity.\nIn 2020, the Company’s two main owners started a new business, Zeppelin Worldwide, Inc. and its subsidiary, Zeppelin Taiwan, Ltd. (together “Zeppelin”). Zeppelin’s focus is\non the development of cloud-based products. Zeppelin was considered a variable interest entity (VIE) and was consolidated with the Company. On February 28, 2023, the\nFounders transferred their interest in Zeppelin to the Company and Zeppelin became a wholly-owned subsidiary. The transaction had no impact on the consolidated financial\nstatements, other than $1.1 million Advance to Founders and the $1.1 million Payable to Founders are now eliminated.\nMerger with BYTE Acquisition Corp. (“BYTE”)\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company completed the merger (the “Merger”) contemplated by the Merger Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2023 (as amended on September 22,\n2023 and as may be further amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among BYTS, BYTE Merger Sub, Inc., a Washington corporation and\na direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BYTS (“Merger Sub”), and Airship AI.\nEffective December 21, 2023, following the filing of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington, Merger Sub merged with and into Airship AI\nwith Airship AI as the surviving corporation. Thus, Airship AI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, Airship AI changed its name\nto “Airship AI, Inc.” See Note 13 —Reverse Recapitalization for additional information.\n81\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred losses from operations the past few years and had an accumulated deficit of $16,582,038 as of December 31, 2023. The Company also has at\nDecember 31, 2023 a working capital deficit of approximately $6,174,000. The net working capital deficit includes a couple of items that are expected to require limited cash\noutlays in the future including the current deferred revenue totaling $4,009,000 and convertible debt totaling $2,825,000, which we expect to be converted to equity. The\nCompany has primarily funded its operations with proceeds from debt borrowings, advances from founders, and proceeds from the Merger.\nThe Company has recently received purchase orders from various government agency customers totaling over $13 million from which we expect to start receiving cash in the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\nMr. Huang has committed to providing $2.5 million in additional temporary funding if it is necessary.\nBased on the Company’s actions undertaken during 2023 and 2024 to close customer deals, manage operating expenses and opportunities to raise additional capital after the\nMerger, Management believes that the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of\nthese consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s assessment of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement and involves\nrisks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could vary as a result of its near and long-term future capital requirements that will depend on many factors.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nFor periods prior to the Merger, the reported share and per share amounts have been retroactively converted by the applicable exchange ratio with the exception of the\nauthorized shares and shares reserved for issuance. See Note 13—Reverse Recapitalization for additional information.\nFunctional Currency\nThe Company’s consolidated functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The operations of Zeppelin use the Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. At each period end, Zeppelin’s\nbalance sheet is translated into U.S. Dollars based upon the period end exchange rate, while their statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows\nare translated into U.S. Dollars based upon an average exchange rate during the period.\nConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a legal entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity\ninvestors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The Company’s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity,\nwhich change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity’s net assets.\nA VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and\nthe obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary. The Company assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022\nthe Company was considered to be the primary beneficiary of Zeppelin. On February 28, 2023, the Founders transferred their interest in Zeppelin to the Company and Zeppelin\nbecame a wholly owned subsidiary.\n82\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains\ncash balances at various financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company has not\nexperienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk for cash on deposit.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nThe Company primarily generates revenue from sales of systems and products and the related post contract support to customers. The Company’s primary systems and products\ninclude Outpost AI, Acropolis and Airship Command. To date, the majority of the Company’s product revenue that has been recognized consists primarily of a bundled offering\nof hardware and software which delivers on premise solutions to its customers. Separate limited software subscription services have been delivered to customers including those\ncustomers that are able to operate in a cloud based environment. The transaction price recognized as revenue represents the amount the Company expects to be entitled to and is\nprimarily comprised of product revenue, net of returns and variable consideration, including sales incentives provided to customers. Payment is typically due within 30 to 90\ncalendar days of the invoice date.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to\nbe entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the\ncontract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further\ndescribed below.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of the Company’s system offerings, Outpost AI, Acropolis and Airship Command. The Company recognizes product revenue at\na point in time when title transfers, when the products are shipped, or when control of the system is transferred to the customer, which usually is upon delivery of the system and\nwhen contractual performance obligations have been satisfied.\nPost Contract Support Revenue\nPost Contract Support (“PCS”) revenue is derived primarily from the Company’s support and software maintenance agreements (“SMA”). The Company’s PCS includes the\nright to receive, on a when and if available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features as well as bug fixes, and email and telephone support. The Company\nallocates a portion of the transaction price to the PCS performance obligation based on a cost-plus methodology and recognizes the associated revenue on a straight-line basis\nover the estimated term of the support period. The Company’s support contracts are typically one to five years with an average of four years, payment is due within 30 to 90\ncalendars days of the invoice date and may include options to renew. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $196,739\nand $80,929, respectively, related to one-year support contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $4,495,748 and\n$4,912,258, respectively, related to multi-year support contracts.\nOther Services\nThe Company earns other service revenues from installation services, training and licensing which are short-term in nature and revenue for these services are recognized at the\ntime of performance when the service is provided.\n83\nTable of Contents\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s contracts with customers often contain multiple performance obligations that can include three separate obligations: (i) a hardware component (which may be\nbundled with hardware accessories) and the embedded firmware essential to the functionality of the hardware component delivered at the time of sale; (ii) the right to the\nCompany’s downloadable free application and software solutions, and (iii) the right for the customer to receive post contract support (“PCS”) after the initial sale. The\nCompany’s products and PCS offerings have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, the products are distinct from the Company’s PCS services as\ncustomers can benefit from the products without the PCS services and such PCS services are separately identifiable within the contracts. The Company accounts for multiple\nagreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in\neffect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance\nobligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nThe Company establishes the standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through\npast transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price based on its pricing model and offering type (products or PCS services).\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component as the Company’s standard payment terms are less than\none year.\nThe Company sells its products primarily through a direct sales force. The Company considers revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met:\n· The Company has a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,\n· Promised performance obligations are identified,\n· The transaction price, or the amount the Company expects to receive, is determinable and\n· The Company has satisfied the performance obligations to the customer.\nTransfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless the Company is required to provide additional services.\nThe Company’s short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances totaled $4,008,654 and $4,962,126 as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s short-term and long-term\ndeferred revenue balances totaled $4,168,016 and $4,805,431 as of December 31, 2022. Of the deferred revenue balance of $8,973,447 and $9,888,275 as of January 1, 2023\nand 2022, the Company recognized approximately $4,168,016 and $4,593,794 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAccounts Receivable and Provision for Credit Losses\nThe Company generally sells its products to large governmental entities and large corporations in the United States. Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and\nare non-interest bearing.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (codified as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\n326) on January 1, 2023. ASC 326 adds to U.S. GAAP the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, a measurement model based on expected losses rather than incurred\nlosses. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, the Company evaluated receivables regularly and adjusted the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. The Company determined\nestimates of uncollectible accounts receivable based primarily on actual historical bad debt and sales return trends, customers financial condition and general economic\nconditions. Under the application of ASC 326, the Company’s historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as current\neconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. In developing its expected credit loss estimate, the Company\nevaluated the appropriate grouping of financial assets based upon its evaluation of risk characteristics, including consideration of the types of products and services sold.\nAccount balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered\nremote.\nOccasionally certain long-standing customers, who routinely place large orders, will have unusually large receivables balances relative to the total gross receivables.\nManagement monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices before shipping new sales orders. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company did not have a reserve for credit losses as all accounts receivable are considered collectible. Accounts receivable balances as of January 1, 2022,\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31 2023 were $831,353, 705,752 and $1,648,904, respectively.\n84\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Credit and Sales Risk\nThe Company sells its product to commercial and government customers under agreements that are normally paid within 30 days of contract completion. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, three customers represented 34%, 21% and 12% of total revenue from 58 customers, although such a high level of 50% customer concentration is not\ntypical. The primary reason for the increase in reliance on a single customer for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the lag-time in delivering on a large order\nreceived in late 2022 from one division of a customer which was not fulfilled until 2023. As of December 31, 2023, three customers represent approximately 51%, 26% and\n17% of outstanding account receivables. Due to the nature of the customers and timely payment history, customer concentration and credit risk in account receivables is\nminimal.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers represented 28% and 17% of total revenue from 45 customers, which is more representative of our typical customer\nconcentration. As of December 31, 2022, four customers represent approximately 42%, 19%, 14% and 10% of outstanding account receivables. Due to the nature of the\ncustomers and timely payment history, customer concentration and credit risk in account receivables is minimal.\nInventory\nThe Company’s purchase of inventory, primarily computer servers, is undertaken to match purchase orders received from customers. Upon receipt of inventory, the Company\ngenerally configures the servers and loads proprietary software onto the servers before shipping out. The Company holds inventory for a short period of time and as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, it had no inventory in stock. Inventory value is primarily material costs and is valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net\nrealizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and Equipment consists of vehicles, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset. Computer equipment is expensed to research and development or selling, general and administrative expense and\nany furniture and computer equipment is either fully depreciated or immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nLong-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future\nservice potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying\nvalues exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results. The Company recorded impairment losses of $0 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as\nmaterials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.\nThe Company’s current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving the Company’s products. The Company is also actively involved in identifying\nnew applications. The Company’s current internal team along with outside consultants has considerable experience working with the application of the Company’s technologies\nand their applications. The Company engages third party experts as required to supplement the Company’s internal team. The Company believes that continued development of\nnew and enhanced technologies is essential to the Company’s future success. The Company incurred expenses of $2,729,492 and $3,614,814 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, on development activities.\n85\nTable of Contents\nSoftware Development Costs\nCosts incurred in the development of software programs for the Company’s products are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility of the software has been\nestablished. Generally, technological feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary functions described in its original specifications, contains features\nrequired for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete. After technological feasibility is\nestablished, any additional costs are capitalized. Capitalization of software costs ceases when the software is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use. No\nsoftware development costs have been capitalized as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCost of Net Revenues\nCost of net revenues for products includes components and freight. Cost of net revenues for post contract support and other services includes primarily the cost of personnel and\npersonnel-related expenses to conduct implementations and ongoing client support.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwere $94,272 and $69,975, respectively.\nShipping and Handling of Products\nAmounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are included in net revenues. Costs incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost\nof revenues.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on\nobservable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an\nentity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 —Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 —Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and\naccrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and\nliabilities. The Company recorded its Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note, earnout liability, Private Warrants and the warrants that were issued with this Note at fair\nvalue, remeasured on a recurring basis and considered them as Level 3 instruments. The method of determining the fair value of the Senior Secured Convertible Promissory\nNote and warrants are described below.\nThe Company classifies as liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net- cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event\nis outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\n86\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes at Fair Value\nThe Company has elected the fair value option to account for the Senior Secured Convertible Note that was issued on June 22, 2023 and the convertible notes that were issued\nin October and November 2023 and record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As a\nresult of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible notes are recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred. Values are based on prices\nor valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a\nparticular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the liability. Considerable judgment is\nnecessary to interpret market data and determine an estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methods may have a material effect on the\nestimated fair values. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has used a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model that factors in potential outcomes being consummated, such as\nthe convertible notes being repaid in cash and the convertible notes being converted to common stock. All of these scenarios take into consideration the terms and conditions of\nthe underlying convertible notes plus potential changes in the underlying value of the common stock. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nrecognized an unrealized loss of $240,784 for the change in fair value of the notes and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The\nCompany believes accounting for the convertible notes at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings\nvolatility.\nDerivative Liabilities and Earnout Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments,\nincluding issued share purchase warrants and earnout shares to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant\nto ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be\nrecorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company classifies as liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement\n(including a requirement to net- cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-\ncash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nAt Closing, the Company assumed 515,000 private placement warrants (“Private Warrants”) and 16,184,612 Public Warrants (together the “BYTE Warrants”).\nUpon consummation of the Merger, the Company evaluated the BYTE Warrants and concluded that they did not meet the criteria to be classified within the stockholders’\ndeficit. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The initial\nestimated fair value of the warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The subsequent estimated fair value of the Public Warrants is based on the listed price in an\nactive market for such warrants while the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants continues to be measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with the key inputs being\ndirectly or indirectly observable from the Public Warrants listed price. Since the Public and Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative, the Company recorded the\nPublic and Private Warrants as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value upon the Closing, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognized in the\nconsolidated statements of operations at each reporting date.\nAt Closing, the Airship AI security holders that hold shares of common stock of Airship AI (“Airship Common Stock”), Airship Options, Airship Earnout Warrants or Airship\nSARs (the “Airship Earnout Holders”) have the contingent right to receive up to 5.0 million additional shares of Airship Pubco Common Stock (the “Earnout Shares”), subject\nto certain contingencies. These earnout shares have been categorized into two components: (i) the “Vested Shares” - those associated with stockholders with vested equity at\nthe closing of the Merger that will be earned upon achievement of the Earnout Milestones and (ii) the “Unvested Shares” - those associated with stockholders with unvested\nequity at the closing of the Merger that will be earned over the remaining service period with the Company on their unvested equity shares and upon achievement of the Earnout\nMilestones.\nThe earnout shares associated with vested shares are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40, as the events that determine the number of Earnout\nShares required to be released or issued, as the case may be, include events that were not solely indexed to the fair value of common stock of the Company. The Earnout Shares\nwere measured at Closing and subsequently measured at each reporting date until settled or when they met the criteria for equity classification. Accordingly, the Company\nrecognizes the earnout shares as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The Earnout shares were valued using a Monte Carlo\nanalysis.\n87\nTable of Contents\nAt closing, the unvested earnout shares were considered to be equity instruments and valued at approximately $2,675,000. This amount will be recognized as stock-based\ncompensation going forward over the five-year vesting period.\nDerivative warrant and earnout shares liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of significant current\nassets or require the creation of current liabilities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, stock appreciation rights,\nincentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, unvested earnout shares and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of\ngrant. Stock-based compensation cost is measured by the Company at the grant date and the fair value of the award is recognized as an expense, over the requisite service period\nwhich is generally the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The\nCompany’s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends upon future taxable income, as well as the limitations discussed below. For financial reporting purposes, a deferred tax\nasset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration. The\nCompany considers historical and future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, and ongoing tax\nplanning strategies in assessing the need for valuation.\nAdvances due to Founders and Advances due from Founders\nThe Company accounts for advances made to founders as a contra equity balance unless payment has been received subsequent to period end or such amounts can be offset with\namounts due to the Founders. As of December 31, 2022 the Company has $1,100,000 of advances due from the Founders and advances due to the Founders. The transactions\nwere entered into separately by Airship and Zeppelin and thus are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In February 2023, these balances were\neliminated in a transaction involving the shareholders. See Notes 3 and 10.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI $1,900,000 and were repaid $1,300,000, with $600,000 recorded as advances from\nfounders as of December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI $1,350,000 and were repaid $200,000, with $1,750,000\nrecorded as advances from founders as of December 31, 2023.The advances are non-interest bearing and Airship AI expects to pay the balance off within a one year period.\nDuring 2024, Mr. Huang advanced Airship AI $900,000 and was repaid $900,000, with $1,750,000 recorded as advances from founders as of March 29, 2024. The advances\nare non-interest bearing and Airship AI expects to pay the balance off within a one year period.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. There was other comprehensive loss of $2,702 and $10,106 related\nforeign exchange translation for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 (“ASC 205-40”), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\nwhich the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern\nuncertainties in their consolidated financial statements. ASC 205-40 requires management to perform assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within\none year of the date of issuance of the entity’s consolidated financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the consolidated financial statements are available to\nbe issued, when applicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is “substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” and\nmanagement plans to alleviate the going concern.\n88\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements relate to the calculation of revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, valuation of common stock, valuation of Senior Secured Convertible Notes,\nwarrant liability, earnout share liabilities, accruals for potential liabilities including income taxes, valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation assumptions related to share-\nbased compensation.\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is based upon the net income (loss) for the year divided by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income per\nshare is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, warrants, convertible\nnotes payable and stock appreciation rights) outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2022\nare not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share given the Company incurred a loss and they are anti-dilutive.\nReportable Segments\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected\ninformation about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and\nservices the Company offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is\ndeveloped each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s\nDisclosure Update and Simplification Initiative, which clarifies and improves disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics. ASU 2023-06 aligns\ndisclosure and presentation requirements under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”)\nregulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K\nbecomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years after the date of such removal. Future adoption of the new\nstandard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves segment disclosure requirements primarily through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within reported measures\nof segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, how the CODM assesses segment performance, and additional detail\naround other segment items. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Future adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n89\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which addresses investor requests for more transparency around income tax\ninformation. ASU 2023-09 requires additional information within the disclosures related to income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Future adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAll other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not\nor are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.\n3. Advances due to and from Founders and Transactions with Zeppelin Worldwide LLC\nIn 2020, Victor Huang and Derek Xu, the Founders, officers and directors of the Company, borrowed $3,000,000 (“shareholder advances”) from Airship. As of December 31,\n2022 the Company was owed $1,100,000 by the Founders. Due to the lack of certainty over the payment of interest, the Company will record when received. Due to the\nuncertainty of the timing of payment, the advances will be treated as a long-term asset. The shareholders advances bear interest at 5% and during the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 no interest was paid. On February 28, 2023, the Founders transferred their interest in Zeppelin to the Company and the $1,100,000 and related interest owed by\nthe Founders to the Company was eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Zeppelin had received from the Company $1,095,000 in cash advances to fund operations which commenced in 2021. These advances between the\ncompanies are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022 Zeppelin owes the Founders $1,100,000 for funds they have provided for the\ncommencement of operations in 2021. The balance was not expected to be paid in the next year and was treated as long-term liabilities. On February 28, 2023, in connection\nwith the transfer of the Zeppelin ownership from the shareholders to the Company, the $1,100,000 Payable to the founders was eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Zeppelin had approximately $73,000 in assets which is primarily cash, and accrued liabilities of approximately $60,000. As of December 31, 2022,\nZeppelin's liability to the Company and shareholders for advances totals $2,254,000. Zeppelin advances from the Company at December 31, 2022 totaling approximately\n$1,150,000 are eliminated in consolidation. As of December 31, 2022 the Zeppelin stockholder’s deficit totaled approximately $2,181,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI $1,900,000 and were repaid $1,300,000, with $600,000 recorded as advances from\nfounders as of December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu advanced Airship AI $1,350,000 and were repaid $200,000, with $1,750,000\nrecorded as advances from founders as of December 31, 2023. The advances are non-interest bearing and Airship AI expects to pay the balance off within a one year period.\nDuring 2024, Mr. Huang advanced Airship AI $900,000 and was repaid $900,000, with $1,750,000 recorded as advances from founders as of March 29, 2024. The advances\nare non-interest bearing and Airship AI expects to pay the balance off within a one year period.\nMr. Huang and Mr. Xu originally owned all the Zeppelin membership units. When Zeppelin started, their intent was exploring the technology in-development and determine\nvalue for external customers by providing cloud based back-end products. After a period of time for Zeppelin’s development it became apparent these efforts would be of value\nand accretive to the Company. In 2022, the Company began utilizing Zeppelin’s research and development personnel to develop the Company’s products. On February 28,\n2023, the Founders transferred their interest in Zeppelin to the Company.\n4. Property and Equipment, Net\n90\nTable of Contents\nProperty and equipment, net as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the following:\nEstimated\nDecember 31, December 31,\nUseful Lives 2023 2022\nVehicles 5 years $ 74,398 $ 199,502\nLess: accumulated depreciation (72,537) (182,762)\n$ 1,861 $ 16,740\nTotal depreciation expense was $14,879 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company retired fully depreciated\nassets with a cost basis of $125,104. All equipment is used for selling, general and administrative purposes and accordingly all depreciation is classified in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses.\n5. Revenues\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company’s net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of approximately $7.4 million and $9.4 million of hardware and software bundled\nsystems for which revenue is transferred at a point in time. The Company’s remaining net revenue of approximately $4.9 million and $5.2 million relates to PCS revenue and\nother services which are transferred over time. Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing, and\nuncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flow are substantially similar.\nContract Balances\nA receivable is recognized in the period the Company delivers goods or provides services or when the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. The Company usually\ndoes not record contract assets because the Company has an unconditional right to payment upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, and therefore, a receivable is more\ncommonly recorded than a contract asset. Receivables are generally paid within thirty days and there is no financing element to the customer contracts. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, there are no unbilled receivable balances.\nThe Company’s short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances totaled $4,008,654 and $4,962,126 as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s short-term and long-term\ndeferred revenue balances totaled $4,168,016 and $4,805,431 as of December 31, 2022. Of the deferred revenue balance of $8,973,447 and $9,888,275 as of January 1, 2023\nand 2022, the Company recognized approximately $4,168,016 and $4,593,794 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $9.0 million of remaining performance obligations, which were comprised of deferred service contracts not yet\ndelivered. The Company expects to recognize approximately 45% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2024 and the remaining 55% in fiscal 2025\nand years thereafter.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company does not pay any material variable compensation to obtain a customer contract. Additionally, the majority of the Company’s cost of fulfillment as a seller of\nproducts is classified as inventory and then cost of revenue when the product is sold. Other costs of contract fulfillment such as software maintenance are expensed in the period\nincurred and align with when the revenue is amortized.\n6. Notes Payable, Line of Credit and Convertible Notes Payable\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company received $1,131,878 under the Paycheck Protection Program of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7(a) Loan Program\npursuant to the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Pub. Law 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020). The Note Payable bears interest at 1% and is due\nJanuary 23, 2026. The Company accrued interest of $9,845 as of December 31, 2021. The Company has used the funds in accordance with the legal requirements and has\napplied for forgiveness. No payments are due unless the Company receives notification that their application for forgiveness is not approved at which time monthly payments\nthrough January 2026 would be required to repay the balance. In May 2022, the entire unpaid balance was forgiven and approximately $1,146,000 recognized as other income.\n91\nTable of Contents\nOn July 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Business Loan with Funding Circle of Denver, Colorado for $500,000. The Company received $480,050. The $500,000 plus\ninterest at 6.99% is being repaid at $22,384 per month over twenty-four months. The Business Loan is secured by the assets of the Company and is guaranteed by the founders.\nThe balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0 and $424,540, respectively. As of December 31 2022, $292,932 was due in 2023 and $131,608 in 2024. The Company\nrecorded interest expense of $5,064 and $0 during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. On June 21, 2023, the Company paid the remaining balance of $256,541 to pay\noff the Loan.\nThe Company had an $85,000 revolving line of credit agreement with no stated expiration date. The Company owed $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The line of credit\ntotaling $85,300 was paid off on June 20, 2023 and was terminated.\nOn June 22, 2023, the Company issued a $2,000,000 senior secured convertible promissory note to Platinum Capital Partner, Inc. As a condition of funding, the Company paid\noff three small notes and accounts payable totaling $374,000. At the option of the holder, the note is convertible into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock.\nThe conversion into the Company’s common stock was $6.50 per share as of December 31, 2023. The repayment amount of the note is1 10% ($2,200,000) and matures on June\n22, 2024. The number of common shares issuable equals 452,240 if fully converted into common stock, including accrued interest. Interest on the note is6 % per annum\ncalculated on 360 days.\nIf, at any time while the note is outstanding, the effective time of the merger between BYTE and the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated on June 22, 2023\noccurs, then, any subsequent conversion of the note, the holder has the right to receive, for each conversion share that would had been issuable upon conversion immediately\nprior to the BYTE merger, at the option of the holder, the same kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive on the occurrence of the BYTE\nmerger if it had been, immediately prior to the BYTE merger, the holder of one share of common stock (“BYTE alternate consideration”). The BYTE alternate consideration\nconversion price for purposes of any conversion following the BYTE merger, the conversion price is the lower of (A) $6.50 for each unit and (B) 65% of the volume weighted\naverage price for the BYTE alternate consideration for the preceding five trading days immediately prior to any conversion by the holder, but (C) in no event will the conversion\nprice be below $4.00, subject to anti-dilution provisions. The note was amended and restated on February 2, 2024. See Note 18 – Subsequent Events.\nOn October 3, 2023, the Company issued senior secured convertible promissory notes for $600,000 to two private investors. At the option of the holders, the notes are\nconvertible into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and stock. The Conversion Price shall be the lower of (A) $6.50 for each unit or share of BYTE Alternate\nConsideration, subject to appropriate adjustment and (B) 65% of the VWAP for the BYTE Alternate consideration for the preceding five (5) Trading Days immediately prior to\nany conversion by the Holder, but (C) in no event shall the Conversion Price be below $4.00, subject to appropriate adjustment. The repayment amount of the notes is 110%\n($660,000) and mature on September 30, 2024. Interest on the notes is 6% per annum calculated on 360 days.\nThe Company accounts for the notes under the fair value method of accounting and as of December 31, 2023 the notes are recorded at 2$,825,366. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase in the fair value of the convertible note payable totaling $240,784 which was recorded as loss from change in fair value\nof convertible debt on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. In connection with the convertible notes transaction, the Company issued warrants to purchase\n53,800 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.50 upon the conclusion of the BYTE merger. The value of the warrants totaled $15,418 and reduced the fair value\nof the convertible promissory notes. See Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements for more information.\n7.

Generally, all matters to be voted on by\nstockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders present in person or\nrepresented by proxy, voting together as a single class.\nDividend Rights. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such\ndividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board out of funds legally available for such purposes.\nLiquidation Rights. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to\nshare ratably in all assets remaining after payment of the Company’s debts and other liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of Preferred Stock or any class or series of\nstock having a preference over the Common Stock, then outstanding, if any.\nOther rights. The holders of Common Stock have no pre-emptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions\napplicable to the Common Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of the Common Stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of the Preferred\nStock that the Company may issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nThere are no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Charter authorizes the Board to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock. Unless required by law or any\nstock exchange, the authorized shares of Preferred Stock will be available for issuance without further action by the holders of Common Stock. The Board has the discretion to\ndetermine the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges\nand liquidation preferences, of each series of Preferred Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of\nthe Company without further action by the stockholders. Additionally, the issuance of Preferred Stock may adversely affect the holders of Common Stock by restricting\ndividends on the Common Stock, diluting the voting power of the Common Stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of the Common Stock. As a result of these or other\nfactors, the issuance of Preferred Stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of the Common Stock, restricting dividends on the Company’s capital stock, diluting\nthe voting power of Common Stock, impairing the liquidation rights of the Company’s capital stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. At present,\nthere are no plans to issue any Preferred Stock.\n2022 Combined Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan\nRelated to the Share Exchange Agreement with Super Simple AI, Inc., on February 17, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Combined Incentive and\nNon-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the “2022 Plan”) to issue options to acquire a maximum of 3,000,000 common stock shares. Effective upon the Closing, the 2022 Plan will no\nlonger be available for use for the grant of future awards. The 2022 Plan will continue to govern the terms of awards that have been granted under the 2022 Plan before, and that\nare still outstanding following, the Merger.\nThe 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including options that are intended to qualify as “incentive stock options” under Section 422 of the Code, as well as non-\nqualified stock options. Each award is set forth in a separate agreement with the person who received the award which indicates the type, terms and conditions of the award.\n93\nTable of Contents\nCertain Transactions\nIf as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in our capital stock, the outstanding shares of\ncommon stock are increased or decreased or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company without the receipt of consideration by\nthe Company, or, if, as a result of any merger or consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the outstanding shares are converted into or\nexchanged for other securities of the Company. or any successor entity, the administrator shall make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of\nshares reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan, (ii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding awards under the 2022 Plan, (iii) the\nrepurchase price, if any, per share subject to each outstanding award, and (iv) the exercise price for each share subject to any then outstanding options under the 2022 Plan.\nAmendment and Termination\nOur board of directors may terminate or amend the 2022 Plan at any time, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding award without the holder’s\nconsent. However, we must generally obtain stockholder approval for any such amendments to the extent required by applicable law. The administrator may exercise its\ndiscretion to reduce the exercise price of outstanding stock options to the then current fair market value if the fair market value of the common stock covered by such option has\ndeclined since the date the option was granted, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, each outstanding option under the 2022 Plan that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into (i) an option\n(each, a “Converted Stock Option”), on substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, to\npurchase the number of shares of Common Stock, determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock subject to such award as of immediately prior to the\nEffective Time by the Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to (A) the exercise price per share of common stock of such award divided by\n(B) the Conversion Ratio, and (ii) the right to receive a number of Earnout Shares in accordance with, and subject to, the contingencies set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nStock Appreciation Rights Plan\nRelated to the Share Exchange Agreement with Super Simple AI, Inc., on February 17, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Stock Appreciation Rights\nPlan (the “SAR Plan”) to issue a maximum of 1,500,000, which was later adjusted to 2,637,150 stock appreciation rights (“SAR”) after the Merger closed.\nAs of December 31, 2023, after adjusting for the Merger, there were one 1,758,100 SARs outstanding with a base value of $0.12 and January 2028 expiration. The SARs were\nfully vested and expensed at the grant date on January 16, 2018.\nPayment of Appreciation Amount\nThe appreciation distribution in respect to a SAR may be paid in cash, in common stock of the Company, in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration,\nas determined by the Board and contained in the stock appreciation rights agreement evidencing such SAR.\nAmendment and Termination\n94\nTable of Contents\nOur board of directors may terminate or amend the SAR Plan at any time, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding award without the holder’s\nconsent.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, each SAR granted under the SAR Plan that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into a stock appreciation\nright denominated in shares of Common Stock (each, a “Converted SAR”). Each Converted SAR will continue to have and be subject to substantially the same terms and\nconditions as were applicable to such SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Converted SAR will cover that number of shares of Common Stock\nequal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of common stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Conversion Ratio and (B) a\nnumber of Earnout Shares in accordance with, and subject to, the contingencies set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the per share base value for each share of Common\nStock covered by the Converted SAR will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the base value per share of common stock of such SAR immediately prior to the\nEffective Time by (B) the Conversion Ratio.\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company has adopted the Equity Incentive Plan, which plan was approved by stockholders at the extraordinary general meeting. This section summarizes certain principal\nfeatures of the Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe Equity Incentive Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which the Company can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to its officers,\nemployees, directors, consultants and advisers. The purpose of the Equity Incentive Plan is to help the Company attract, motivate and retain such persons with awards under the\nEquity Incentive Plan and thereby enhance shareholder value.\nAdministration. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Board, and upon consummation of the Merger will be administered by the compensation committee of the\nBoard, which shall consist of three members of the Board, each of whom is a “non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act\nand “independent” for purposes of any applicable listing requirements. If a member of the compensation committee is eligible to receive an award under the Equity Incentive\nPlan, such compensation committee member shall have no authority under the plan with respect to his or her own award. Among other things, the compensation committee has\ncomplete discretion, subject to the express limits of the Equity Incentive Plan, to determine the directors, employees and nonemployee consultants to be granted an award, the\ntype of award to be granted the terms and conditions of the award, the form of payment to be made and/or the number of shares of common stock subject to each award, the\nexercise price of each option and base price of each stock appreciation right (“SAR”), the term of each award, the vesting schedule for an award, whether to accelerate vesting,\nthe value of the common stock underlying the award, and the required withholding, if any. The compensation committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding\naward, provided that the participant’s consent to such action is required if the action would impair the participant’s rights or entitlements with respect to that award. The\ncompensation committee is also authorized to construe the award agreements, and may prescribe rules relating to the Equity Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\ncompensation committee does not have any authority to grant or modify an award under the Equity Incentive Plan with terms or conditions that would cause the grant, vesting\nor exercise thereof to be considered nonqualified “deferred compensation” subject to Code Section 409A, unless such award is structured to be exempt from or comply with all\nrequirements of Code Section 409A.\nGrant of Awards; Shares Available for Awards. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, SARs, performance share awards, performance unit awards,\ndistribution equivalent right awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and unrestricted stock awards to non-employee directors, officers, employees and\nnonemployee consultants of the Company or its affiliates. The aggregate number of shares of common stock initially reserved and available for grant and issuance under the\nEquity Incentive Plan is 4,000,000. Such aggregate number of shares of stock will automatically increase on January 1 of each year for a period of ten years commencing on\nJanuary 1, 2024 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2033, in an amount equal to 2.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the\npreceding year; provided, however, that the Board may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of\ncommon stock. No more than 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan in connection with incentive stock options.\nShares shall be deemed to have been issued under the Equity Incentive Plan solely to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an award. If any award granted under\nthe Equity Incentive Plan expires, is cancelled, or terminates unexercised or is forfeited, the number of shares subject thereto is again available for grant under the Equity\nIncentive Plan, other than any shares tendered or withheld in order to exercise or satisfy withholding obligation in respect of any award. The Equity Incentive Plan shall\ncontinue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board.\n95\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the Closing, it is expected that all of our employees, consultants, advisors and service providers and all of our non-executive officer directors will be eligible to\nparticipate in the Equity Incentive Plan. Future new hires and additional non-employee directors and/or consultants would be eligible to participate in the Equity Incentive Plan\nas well. The number of stock options and/or shares of restricted stock to be granted to executives and directors cannot be determined at this time as the grant of stock options\nand/or shares of restricted stock is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation Limit. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for a limit on non-employee director compensation. The maximum number of shares of stock\nthat may be subject to an award granted under the Equity Incentive Plan during any single fiscal year to any non-employee director, when taken together with any cash fees paid\nto such non-employee director during such year in respect of his or her service as a non-employee director (including service as a member or chair of any committee of the\nboard), shall not exceed $250,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such award based on the fair market value on the date of grant of such award for financial reporting\npurposes).\nStock Options. The Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of either “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”), which are intended to meet the requirements for special federal\nincome tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, or “nonqualified stock options” (“NQSOs”). Stock options may be granted on such terms and conditions as the\ncompensation committee may determine, which shall be specified in the option agreement; provided, however, that the per share exercise price under a stock option may not be\nless than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of the stock option may not exceed 10 years (110% of such value and five years in\nthe case of an ISO granted to an employee who owns (or is deemed to own) more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of our company or\na parent or subsidiary of our company). ISOs may only be granted to employees. In addition, the aggregate fair market value of common stock covered by one or more ISOs\n(determined at the time of grant), which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Any excess is treated as a NQSO.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A SAR entitles the participant, upon exercise, to receive an amount, in cash or stock or a combination thereof, equal to the increase in the fair market\nvalue of the underlying common stock between the date of grant and the date of exercise. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable SAR award agreement\nthe terms and conditions of the SAR, including the base value for the SAR (which shall not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date of grant), the number of\nshares subject to the SAR and the period during which the SAR may be exercised and any other special rules and/or requirements which the compensation committee imposes\non the SAR. No SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of grant. SARs may be granted in tandem with, or independently of, stock options\ngranted under the Equity Incentive Plan. A SAR granted in tandem with a stock option (i) is exercisable only at such times, and to the extent, that the related stock option is\nexercisable in accordance with the procedure for exercise of the related stock option; (ii) terminates upon termination or exercise of the related stock option (likewise, the\ncommon stock option granted in tandem with a SAR terminates upon exercise of the SAR); (iii) is transferable only with the related stock option; and (iv) if the related stock\noption is an ISO, may be exercised only when the value of the stock subject to the stock option exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. A SAR that is not granted in\ntandem with a stock option is exercisable at such times as the compensation committee may specify.\nPerformance Shares and Performance Unit Awards. Performance share and performance unit awards entitle the participant to receive cash or shares of common stock upon the\nattainment of specified performance goals. In the case of performance units, the right to acquire the units is denominated in cash values. The compensation committee shall set\nforth in the applicable award agreement the performance goals and objectives and the period of time to which such goals and objectives shall apply. If such goals and objectives\nare achieved, such distribution of shares, or payment in cash, as the case may be, shall be made no later than by the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month next\nfollowing the end of the company’s fiscal year to which such performance goals and objectives relate, unless otherwise structured to comply with Code Section 409A.\n96\nTable of Contents\nDistribution Equivalent Right Awards. A distribution equivalent right award entitles the participant to receive bookkeeping credits, cash payments and/or common stock\ndistributions equal in amount to the distributions that would have been made to the participant had the participant held a specified number of shares of common stock during the\nperiod the participant held the distribution equivalent right. A distribution equivalent right may be awarded as a component of another award (but not an option or SAR award)\nunder the Equity Incentive Plan, where, if so awarded, such distribution equivalent right will expire or be forfeited by the participant under the same conditions as under such\nother award. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable distribution equivalent rights award agreement the terms and conditions, if any, including whether the\nholder is to receive credits currently in cash, is to have such credits reinvested (at fair market value determined as of the date of reinvestment) in additional shares of common\nstock, or is to be entitled to choose among such alternatives.\nRestricted Stock Awards. A restricted stock award is a grant or sale of common stock to the holder, subject to such restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other\nrestrictions, if any, as the compensation committee or the board of directors may impose, which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such\ncircumstances (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), in such instalments or otherwise, as the compensation committee or\nthe board of directors may determine at the date of grant or purchase or thereafter. If provided for under the restricted stock award agreement, a participant who is granted or\nhas purchased restricted stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the restricted stock and the right to receive dividends thereon (subject to\nany mandatory reinvestment or other requirement imposed by the compensation committee or the board of directors or in the award agreement). During the restricted period\napplicable to the restricted stock, subject to certain exceptions, the restricted stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of by\nthe participant.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards. A restricted stock unit award provides for a grant of shares or a cash payment to be made to the holder upon the satisfaction of predetermined\nindividual service-related vesting requirements, based on the number of units awarded to the holder. The compensation committee shall set forth in the applicable restricted\nstock unit award agreement the individual service-based vesting requirements which the holder would be required to satisfy before the holder would become entitled to payment\nand the number of units awarded to the holder. The holder of a restricted stock unit shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of\ncommon stock, or one share of common stock, as determined in the sole discretion of the compensation committee and as set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement,\nfor each restricted stock unit subject to such restricted stock unit award, if and to the extent the holder satisfies the applicable vesting requirements. Such payment or distribution\nshall be made no later than by the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month next following the end of the calendar year in which the restricted stock unit first\nbecomes vested, unless otherwise structured to comply with Code Section 409A. A restricted stock unit shall not constitute an equity interest in the company and shall not\nentitle the holder to voting rights, dividends or any other rights associated with ownership of shares prior to the time the holder shall receive a distribution of shares.\nUnrestricted Stock Awards. An unrestricted stock award is a grant or sale of shares of common stock to the employees, non-employee directors or non-employee consultants\nthat are not subject to transfer, forfeiture or other restrictions, in consideration for past services rendered to the company or an affiliate or for other valid consideration.\nAdjustment to Shares. Subject to any required action by shareholders of the company, the number of shares of common stock covered by each outstanding award shall be\nproportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares, including, but not limited to, a stock\nsplit, reverse stock split, recapitalization, continuation or reclassification, or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the stock) or any other increase or decrease in the\nnumber of such shares effected without receipt of consideration by the company.\n97\nTable of Contents\nChange-in-Control Provisions. The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, at the time an award is granted or at any time prior to, coincident with or after the time\nof a change in control, cause any award either (i) to be cancelled in consideration of a payment in cash or other consideration in amount per share equal to the excess, if any, of\nthe price or implied price per share of common stock in the change in control over the per share exercise, base or purchase price of such award, which may be paid immediately\nor over the vesting schedule of the award; (ii) to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such surviving\ncorporation following such change in control; (iii) accelerate any time periods, or waive any other conditions, relating to the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an\naward so that any award to a holder whose employment has been terminated as a result of a change in control may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a\ndate fixed by the compensation committee; (iv) to be purchased from a holder whose employment has been terminated as a result of a change of control, upon the holder’s\nrequest, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such award been currently\nexercisable or payable; or (v) terminate any then outstanding award or make any other adjustment to the awards then outstanding as the compensation committee deems\nnecessary or appropriate to reflect such transaction or change. The number of shares subject to any award shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nTransferability. No award may be assigned, transferred, sold, exchanged, encumbered, pledged or otherwise hypothecated or disposed of by a holder except by will or by the\nlaws of descent and distribution, or by gift to any immediate family member of the holder, subject to compliance with applicable laws.\nAmendment and Termination. The compensation committee may adopt, amend and rescind rules relating to the administration of the Equity Incentive Plan, and amend, suspend\nor terminate the Equity Incentive Plan, but no such amendment or termination will be made that materially and adversely impairs the rights of any participant with respect to\nany award received thereby under the Equity Incentive Plan without the participant’s consent, other than amendments that are necessary to permit the granting of awards in\ncompliance with applicable laws. In addition, no amendment that results (directly or indirectly ) in the reduction of the exercise price of an option or SAR or that otherwise\nrequires shareholder approval under applicable law will be made without shareholder approval.\nDetermining Fair Value under ASC 718\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options, SAR’s and other equity-based compensation using the Black-Scholes-Merton option\nvaluation model for estimating fair value of stock options granted under the plan. The Company amortizes the fair value of stock options on a ratable basis over the requisite\nservice periods, which are generally the vesting periods. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The\nCompany estimates the volatility of its common stock based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies over the most recent period corresponding with the\nestimated expected life of the award. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black Scholes-Merton option valuation model on the implied yield currently\navailable on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award. The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its\ncommon stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-\nScholes-Merton valuation model and adjusts stock-based compensation for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience.\nThe effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The Company recorded stock-based compensation of $715,727 and\n$546,460 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nStock Incentive Plans Activity (Excluding SAR)\nAs of December 31, 2023, there are 4,664,589 options outstanding under various stock option plans to acquire common stock at an average exercise price of $0.55 per share.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there is $635,351 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to employee granted stock options that are not vested.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued stock option grants to employees for5 02,522 shares at an average exercise price of $1.67 per share. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued stock option grants to employees for 492,695 shares at an average exercise price of $1.64 per share. During the year\nended December 31, 2022, stock option grants to employees for 143,581 shares at an exercise price of $1.00 per share were forfeited. The stock option grants vest over various\nterms and expire in five to ten years. Activity in the stock incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n98\nTable of Contents\nWeighted\nOptions Average Potential\nShares Exercise Price Proceeds\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 3,812,953 $ 0.26 $ 982,326\nGranted 492,695 1.64 808,020\nForfeitures (143,581) (1.00) (81,668)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 4,162,067 0.411 1,708,677\nGranted 502,522 1.67 837,087\nExercised - - -\nForfeitures - - -\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 4,664,589 $ 0.55 $ 2,545,765\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nWeighted Weighted Life\nAverage Average\nRemaining Weighted Exercise In Years -\nRange of Number Life Average Number Price Vested\nExercise and\nExercise Prices Outstanding In Years Price Exercisable Exercisable Exercisable\n$0.12 2,646,410 4.38 $ 0.12 2,646,410 $ 0.12 4.38\n0.57 1,022,963 4.47 0.57 1,022,963 0.57 4.47\n1.64 945,403 9.08 1.64 386,806 1.64 9.08\n1.90 49,813 3.98 1.90 - 1.90 3.98\n4,664,589 5.35 $ 0.55 4,056,179 $ 0.38 5.35\nThe significant weighted-average assumptions relating to the valuation of the Company’s stock option grants for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nAssumptions 12/31/2023 12/31/2022\nEstimated stock price 1.89 1.64\nExercise price 1.64 1.64\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected life 5-10 years 5 years\nExpected volatility 39% 70%\nRisk free interest rate 0.00% 4.06%\nThere were stock incentive plan awards outstanding at December 31, 2023 totaling4 ,664,589 shares with an aggregate intrinsic value of $5,394,000.\nThere were no SAR grants in 2023.\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock\nSee Note 14 for Public Warrants and Private Warrants assumed after the Merger.\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company issued equity classified warrants to purchase common to Victor Huang and Derek Xu for1 ,344,951 shares to each of the founders. The warrants\nwere valued at $2,136,115 based on the exercise price of $1.77, the fair market stock price of $1.89, a five year term, a volatility of 39.4% and interest risk-free rate of 3.41%.\nThe warrants were recorded as stock-based compensation expense and as additional paid in capital. All warrants are fully vested as they were issued for services performed and.\nIn connection with the convertible notes transaction, the Company issued warrants to purchase5 3,800 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.50 upon the\nconclusion of the BYTE merger. The warrants were initially valued using a Black-Scholes Model at $15,418 based on the exercise price of $13.18, stock price per share of\n$1.77, a five-year expected term, volatility of 39.4% and risk-free rate of 3.41%. The warrants are classified as a liability, included in accrued expenses in the consolidated\nbalance sheet. There was no significant change in fair value of these warrants during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n99\nTable of Contents\nUnvested Earnout Shares\nA portion of the earnout shares may be issued to individuals with unvested equity awards. While the payout of these shares requires the achievement of the Earn-out Milestones,\nthe individuals must complete the remaining service period associated with these unvested equity awards to be eligible to receive the earnout shares. As a result, these unvested\nearn-out shares are equity-classified awards and have an aggregated grant date fair value of $2,675,223 (or $5.96 per share). During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany stock-based compensation expense for the vesting of earnout shares was immaterial. As of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\nearnout shares totaled $2,675,223. The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation cost is expected to be recognized is five years.\n9. Employee 401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) plan for its employees. The plan provides for a 3.5% match on up to 6% of deferred salary. The Company expensed $182,446 and $198,534 of\ncontributions during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n10. Related Party Transactions\nIn 2020, Victor Huang and Derek Xu, the Founders, officers and directors of the Company, borrowed $3,000,000 (“shareholder advances”) from Airship. As of December 31,\n2022, the Company was owed $1,100,000 by the Founders. Due to the lack of certainty over the payment of interest, the Company will record when received. Due to the\nuncertainty of the timing of payment, the advances will be treated as a long-term asset. The shareholders’ advances bear interest at 5% and during the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 no interest was paid. On February 28, 2023, the Founders transferred their interest in Zeppelin to the Company and the $1,100,000 and related interest owed by\nthe Founders to the Company was eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Zeppelin had received from the Company $1,095,000 in cash advances to fund operations which commenced in 2021. These advances between the\ncompanies are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, Zeppelin owes the Founders $1,100,000 for funds they have provided for the\ncommencement of operations in 2021. The balance was not expected to be paid in the next year and was treated as long term liabilities. On February 28, 2023 in connection with\nthe transfer of the Zeppelin ownership from the shareholders to the Company, the $1,100,000 Payable to the founders was eliminated.\nMr. Huang and Mr. Xu originally owned all the Zeppelin membership units. When Zeppelin started, their intent was exploring the technology in-development and determining\nvalue for external customers by providing cloud based back-end products. After a period of time for Zeppelin’s development it became apparent these efforts would be of value\nand accretive to the Company. In 2022, the Company began utilizing research and development personnel to further develop the Company’s products. On February 28, 2023,\nthe Founders transferred its interest in Zeppelin to the Company\nThe Company sold a vehicle to a founder on March 30, 2021 for a promissory note in the amount of $80,000. The note has a simple interest rate of4 %, compounded annually,\ncomputed daily based on a 360-day year with principal and interest due in March 2023. Interest payments are due annually. The promissory note and interest of $84,844 was\nrepaid during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA condominium in Juanita Beach, Washington was sold to a founder on May 5, 2021 for a secured promissory note in the amount of $750,000. The note has interest of 4% per\nannum, computed on the diminishing principal balance. Interest commenced on the closing with the first payment due on the first of each month after closing. The note is to be\npaid in full on or before 24 months from the date of the note. Interest payments are due annually. The promissory note and interest of $794,917 was repaid during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe Company sold the vehicle and the condominium to the founders and recorded a loss of $31,721 on the date of the sale. The Company recorded notes receivable-related\nparties of $830,000 and accrued interest at 4% of $24,585 as of December 31, 2021. The Company had previously acquired these assets for which the founders were using for a\ncombination of business and personal use.\n100\nTable of Contents\nAdvances due to Founders and Advances due from Founders\nThe Company accounted for advances made to founders as a contra equity balance unless payment has been received subsequent to period end or such amounts can be offset\nwith amounts due to the Founders. As of December 31, 2022 the Company has $1,100,000 of advances due from the Founders and advances due to the Founders. The\ntransactions were entered into separately by Airship and Zeppelin and thus are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In February, 2023 these\nbalances were eliminated in a transaction involving the shareholders. See Note 3.\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company issued equity classified warrants to purchase common to Victor Huang and Derek Xu for1 ,344,951 shares to each of the founders. The warrants\nwere valued at $2,136,115 based on the exercise price of $1.77, the fair market stock price of $1.89, a five year term, a volatility of 39.4% and interest of 3.41%. The warrants\nwere recorded as stock-based compensation expense and as additional paid in capital. All warrants are fully vested as they were issued for services performed.\n11. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is currently not a party to any\npending legal proceeding that is not ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.\nProperties and Operating Leases-Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability\nLease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842,L eases. Right of use lease assets and lease liabilities\nare recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The incremental borrowing taking into\nconsideration the Company’s credit quality and borrowing rate for similar assets is used in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense is recorded as\ngeneral and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2022 and the adoption did\nnot have any impact on previously reported stockholders’ deficit.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Company leased 31,765 square feet for its executive offices in Redmond, Washington. The Company’s net monthly payment was $44,440. The monthly\npayment increased approximately 3% each year and the lease was set to expire onA pril 30, 2024. The Company had two five-year renewal options. In April 2023, the Company\nand its landlord entered into an agreement whereby the Company’s office lease was terminated on September 30, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany recorded a net gain on lease termination of $78,963 as an offset to selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss. The gain is comprised of a $344,093 gain from lease liability termination and a loss of $265,130 for accelerated amortization of right-of-use asset.\nOn July 13, 2023, the Company entered into a new lease in Redmond, WA for 15,567 square feet of office and warehouse space which starts October 1, 2023. The monthly\npayment is $25,000 per month. The lease expires October 31, 2027 and the monthly payment increases 3% on July 31, 2024 and each year thereafter. There is a one three year\noption to extend based on the fair market rate on October 31, 2027.\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company leased offices located in Moorestown, North Carolina. The Company leases3 ,621 square feet and the net monthly payment is $4,828. The\nmonthly payment increases approximately 3%-6% annually thereafter. The lease expired on February 28, 2024 and can be extended for one three-year term.\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company extended a lease leased in Moorestown, North Carolina. The Company leases3 ,621 square feet and the net monthly payment is $6,488.\nThe lease expires on July 29, 2024.\n101\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for office and development facilities for four years and include options to renew. The Company determines whether an\narrangement is or contains a lease based upon the unique facts and circumstances at the inception of the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use\nasses are recorded based upon the present value of the lease payments over the expected lease term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, total operating lease liabilities was\napproximately $1,118,578 and $832,140, respectively. Right of use assets totaled approximately $1,104,804 and $804,338 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All of\nthe lease Current lease liabilities were $174,876 and $628,371 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nrecognized $591,442 and $649,655 in total lease costs for the leases, respectively. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its\nestimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for the operating leases was forty four months at December 31, 2023 and the weighted average discount rate was7 %.\nThe minimum future lease payments as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024 $ 245,051\n2025 359,563\n2026 370,357\n2027 316,785\nTotal remaining payments 1,291,756\nLess Imputed Interest (173,178)\nTotal lease liability $ 1,118,578\n12. Income Taxes and Employee Retention Tax Credits\nThe Company’s provision for income tax for 2023 and 2022 includes the results of operations for Zeppelin which was contributed to the Company on February 28, 2023. Prior\nto the contribution Zeppelin was structured as a limited liability corporation with the profits and losses flowing directly to the owners who were responsible for any taxes. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Zeppelin incurred losses of approximately $560,000 and $1,254,000, respectively.\nThe Company is subject to possible tax examination for the years 2014 through 2023.The Company is also subject to examination with respect to federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards generated and carried forward from those years. There are currently no federal or state income tax audits in process.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate principally due to research and development credit\ncarry-forward, research and experimental expenditures, deferred revenue and certain items such loan forgiveness, tax credits and stock-based compensation expense being\nexcluded from the determination of taxable income (loss).\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ 10,000\nState - -\nForeign - -\nTotal current provision - 10,000\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - -\nTotal deferred income taxes - -\nTotal provision for income taxes $ - $ 10,000\nA reconciliation of the United States Federal Statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2023 2022\nFederal statutory tax rate 21% 21%\nR&D credit, net impact 0% 30%\nNontaxable variable interest loss 0% (53)%\nShare based compensation 5% (23)%\nNontaxable revaluation of fair value instruments (32)% -%\nNontaxable PPP loan forgiveness 0% 48%\nNontaxable ERTC credits 0% 51%\nTrue-up to prior year valuation allowance 0% (50)%\nChange in valuation allowance 6% (26)%\nEffective tax rate 0% (2)%\n103\nTable of Contents\nThe components of net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nDeferred tax assets 2023 2022\nTax credit carryforward $ 1,286,195 $ 1,286,195\nDeferred revenue 1,009,141 1,112,003\nCapitalized research and development costs 951,497 620,791\nNet operating loss carryforward 898,302 318,302\nCapital loss carry-forward 52,560 52,560\nOperating lease liability 234,901 -\nProperty and equipment 4,920 29,971\n4,437,516 3,419,822\nValuation allowance (4,205,507) (3,419,822)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 232,009 $ -\nDeferred tax liabilities\nRight-of-use assets (232,009) -\nTotal net deferred tax $ - $ -\nDeferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income\ntax expense is the sum of the tax currently payable and the change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are established when, in the\nopinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax\nassets and the need for a valuation allowance based on all positive and negative evidence.\nThe Company has significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between the taxable income on our tax returns and GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry\nforwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements\nbecome deductible for income tax purposes, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. The Company assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets\nand the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other\nmatters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience\nwith loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, the Company first considered our history of\ncumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters,\nstatutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, the Company considered both its near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all\navailable evidence (both positive and negative), the Company concluded that recognition of a valuation allowance for all of its deferred tax assets was required at December 31,\n2023 and 2022. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $786,000 and $128,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase during the current year is primarily\nrelated to capitalized research and development expenditures and net operating losses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has a federal net operating loss\ncarryforward totaling approximately $3,800,000 and $1,500,000. The federal net operating loss carryforward generated from the years ended after December 31, 2017 may be\ncarried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, R&D tax credit carryforwards total approximately $1,513,000 and $1,513,000, respectively, and begin to\nexpire in 2036. Realization of the carryforwards is dependent on the Company generating sufficient taxable income and may also be subject to usage limitations to the extent\nthere are changes in the Company’s ownership.\nPursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, annual use of the Company's net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in the\nevent a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The amount of annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company\nimmediately prior to the ownership changes. The Company is in process of performing an assessment of whether a change in ownership has occurred or whether there have\nbeen multiple changes in ownership, within the meaning of Section 382. Based on preliminary assessment, these ownership changes are not expected to materially limit the net\noperating loss carryforward and research and development credits available to offset the Company’s tax liabilities. The Company expects to finalize this assessment in 2024.\n104\nTable of Contents\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions using the “more likely than not” threshold (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent). The recognition threshold\nis met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing\nauthority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are classified as a gross unrecognized tax benefit until they meet the more likely than not standard or are\nresolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. As of December 31, 2023, the unrecognized tax benefit totals\napproximately $227,000. As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized tax benefit totals approximately $227,000 which was an increase of approximately $11,000 from the\nbeginning of 2022.\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate as these unrecognized tax benefits would increase deferred tax assets that would be\nsubject to a full valuation allowance. No material changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits are expected over the next twelve months. Interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if any, will be recognized as a component of income tax expense..\nEmployee Retention Tax Credits\nThe CARES Act allowed eligible employers to claim employee retention tax credits (“ERTC”) for qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020 and before January 1, 2021. The\nERTC was extended to June 30, 2021 under the passage of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 (“ACT”) which was signed into law on December 27, 2020.\nWe qualified for credits under the provisions of the CARES Act for the entire period subsequent to March 12, 2020 through January 1, 2021 and for the entire period subsequent\nto January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021.\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company applied for ERTC credits for qualifying 2020 wages. The Company filed amended payroll tax returns to claim the credit it believed it was\nentitled to, $99,132 and $190,983, respectively. On April 4, 2022, the Company received $99,826 and $192,793, including interest.\nThe Company accounted for this in the year they believed collectability was assured. Considering the length of time after year-end and the lack of certainty over the\ngovernment’s handling of ERTC claims, the Company deemed it appropriate and conservative to not record this transaction in the year ended December 31, 2021 but rather in\n2022 when the cash received.\nOn May 25, 2022, the Company applied for ERTC credits for qualifying 2021 wages. The Company filed amended payroll tax returns to claim the credit it believed it was\nentitled to, $461,043 and $459,614, respectively. The Company received two refunds in January 2023 for $468,880 and $470,970, including interest. The Company recorded the\namounts in payroll tax receivable as of December 31, 2022.\n13. Reverse Recapitalization\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company completed the Merger and received net proceeds of $2.8 million, net of transaction costs of $6.6 million.\nThe Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, BYTS, who was the legal acquirer, was treated as the\n“acquired” company for accounting purposes and Airship AI was treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Airship AI issuing\nshares at the closing of the Merger for the net assets of BYTS as of the closing date, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BYTS was stated at historical cost,\nwith no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Airship AI was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances:\n· Airship AI’s stockholders have the majority voting interest in the combined company;\n· The Airship Pubco Board is composed of one (1) director designated by BYTS and four (4) directors designated by Airship AI;\n· Airship AI’s senior management is the senior management of Airship Pubco;\n· The business of Airship AI comprises the ongoing operations of Airship Pubco; and\n· Airship AI is the larger entity, in terms of substantive assets.\n105\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the shares of common stock issued immediately after the closing of the Merger as well as the impact on the consolidated statement of stockholders’\nequity as of December 21, 2023:\nAdditional Accumulated\nShares Par Amount Common Stock Paid in Capital Deficit\nSPAC Financing 8,891,718 $ 0.0001 $ 889 $ 8,315,186 $ -\nTransaction expenses 532,986 0.0001 53 (6,651,674) -\nEarnout liability (4,470,918) (22,638,859)\nWarrants liability (2,009,105) -\nReverse capitalization on December 21, 2023 9,424,704 $ 942 $ (4,816,511) $ (22,638,859)\n14. Warrants\nAt Closing on December 21, 2023, the Company assumed 515,000 Private Placement Warrants (“Private Warrants”) and 16,184,612 public warrants (“Public Warrants”). The\n515,000 Private Warrants and 16,184,626 Public Warrants were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nEach whole Public Warrant will entitle the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at\nany time commencing 30 days after the Closing, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on\na cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the Warrant Agreement) and such shares of Common Stock are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the\nsecurities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its Public Warrants only for a whole\nnumber of shares of Common Stock. This means only a whole Public Warrants may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. The Public Warrants will expire five years\nafter the Closing, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant\nexercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus\nrelating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No Public Warrants will be exercisable and the Company will\nnot be obligated to issue a share of Common Stock upon exercise of a Public Warrant unless the Common Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered,\nqualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two\nimmediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public Warrant, the holder of such Public Warrant will not be entitled to exercise such Public Warrant and\nsuch Public Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any Public Warrant.\n106\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is registering the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants in a registration statement on Form S-1. In order to comply with the requirements\nof Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act following the Closing, under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event\nlater than 15 business days, after the Closing, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a new registration statement covering the\nregistration under the Securities Act of the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and thereafter the Company will use its best efforts to cause the same\nto become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment or registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration\nor redemption of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement. If such post-effective amendment or registration statement covering the\nCommon Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the Closing, warrant holders may, until such time as there\nis an effective post-effective amendment or registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,\nexercise Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Common Stock\nis at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of\nthe Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)\n(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the\nCompany does not so elect, the Company will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In\nsuch event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Public Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) over the exercise price of the Public Warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361. The “fair market value” as used in this paragraph shall mean the average\nreported closing price of the Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:\n· in whole and not in part;\n· at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n· upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and\n· if, and only if, the closing price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any\n20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (which we refer to as\nthe “Reference Value”).\nThe Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Common Stock\nissuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption\nperiod. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying\nsecurities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n107\nTable of Contents\nWe have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant\nexercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its\nPublic Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Common Stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for\nadjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the\n$11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n· in whole and not in part;\n· at a price of $0.10 per warrant;\n· upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, provided that holders will be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis prior to\nredemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table below, based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) of Common Stock except as otherwise described below;\n· if, and only if, the Reference Value equals or exceeds $10.00 per Public Share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise) or the\nexercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”; and\n· if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share, the Private Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding\nPublic Warrants, as described above.\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the Public Warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless\nbasis. The numbers in the table below represent the number of shares of Common Stock that a warrant holder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, based on the “fair market value” of Common Stock on the corresponding redemption date (assuming holders elect to\nexercise their Public Warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on the volume weighted average price of the\nCommon Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, and the number of months that\nthe corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the warrants, each as set forth in the table below. the Company will provide warrant holders with the final fair\nmarket value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\nThe Private Warrants (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the Closing\n(except, among other limited exceptions, to BYTS’ officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor) and they will not be redeemable by the\nCompany so long as they are held by the Sponsor, members of the Sponsor or their permitted transferees (except as set forth under “— Warrants — Public Warrants —\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00”). The Sponsor or its permitted transferees have the option to exercise the\nPrivate Warrants on a cashless basis. Except as described below, the Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as part of the\nUnits in BYTS’ IPO. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company\nand exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in BYTS’s IPO.\nExcept as described above under “— Public Warrants — Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00,” if holders of\nthe Private Warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Common\nStock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the Private Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of\nthe Common Stock (as defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” means the average reported closing price of\nthe Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that\nwe have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees is because it was not known at the\ntime of the IPO whether the Sponsor would be affiliated with us following a business combination. If the Sponsor remains affiliated with the Company, its ability to sell the\nCompany’s securities in the open market will be significantly limited. The Company has policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling securities except during specific\nperiods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell the Company’s securities, an insider cannot trade in the Company’s securities if he or\nshe is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their Public Warrants and sell the shares received upon such\nexercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has reviewed the terms of the Public and Private Warrants to determine whether warrants should be classified as liabilities or stockholders’ equity in its\nconsolidated balance sheet. In order for a warrant to be classified in stockholders’ equity, the warrant must be (a)indexed to the Company’s equity and (b) meet the conditions\nfor equity classification in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. If a warrant does not meet the conditions for equity classification, it is\ncarried on the consolidated balance sheet as a warrant liability measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrant recorded in the statement of\noperations as change in fair value of warrants. The Company determined that all warrants are required to be carried as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value,\nwith changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. At the closing of the Merger on December 21, 2023, the warrants had an initial fair value of\n$2,009,105, which was recorded as liability and a reduction to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Private and Public\nWarrants had an aggregate fair value of $667,985, which resulted in a gain of $1,341,120 due to decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability subsequent to the closing date.\nSee Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements for more information.\nThe following table is a summary of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public and Private Warrants outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nExercise\nNumber of Expiration Initial Fair\nShares Price Date Value\nPublic Warrants December 21,\n16,184,612 $ 11.50 2028 1,942,153\nPrivate Warrants December 21,\n515,000 $ 11.50 2028 66,952\n15. Earnout Liability\nCertain of the Company’s stockholders are entitled to receive up to 5,000,000 Earnout Shares of the Company’s common stock if the following Earnout Milestones are met.\n(A) 25% of the Earnout Shares if, for the period starting on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the full calendar quarter immediately following the first\nanniversary of the Closing Date, (1) Company Revenue (as defined below) is at least $39 million, or (2) the aggregate value of new contract awards (including\nawards obtained through purchase orders) with federal law enforcement agencies (whether such awards are obtained directly or through intermediaries) has grown\nby at least 100% as compared to the year-over-year amount for the twelve-month period ending on the date of the Merger Agreement (the “First Operating\nPerformance Milestone”);\n(B) 75% of the Earnout Shares if, for the period starting on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the full calendar quarter immediately following the third\nanniversary of the Closing Date, Company Revenue is at least $100 million (the “Second Operating Performance Milestone”);\n(C) 50% of the Earnout Shares if, at any time during the period starting on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, over any twenty\n(20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Airship Pubco Common Stock is greater than or\nequal to $12.50 per share (the “First Share Price Performance Milestone”); and\n(D) 50% of the Earnout Shares if, at any time during the period starting on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, over any twenty\n(20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period the VWAP of the Airship Pubco Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share (the\n“Second Share Price Performance Milestone”).\n109\nTable of Contents\nFurther, the Earnout Milestones are also considered to be met if the Company undergoes a change of control. A change of control is defined as (i) any transaction or series of\nrelated transactions that results in any Person or “group” (within the\nmeaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) acquiring equity interests that represent more than 50% of the total voting power of Parent or (ii) a sale or disposition of all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nNotwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, any Earnout Shares issuable under the Merger Agreement to a Company Earnout Holder in respect of each\nCompany Option or Company SAR held by such Company Earnout Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be earned by such Company Earnout Holder on\nthe later of (i) the occurrence of the applicable Earnout Milestone, and (ii) the date on which the Converted Stock Option in respect of such Company Option or Converted SAR\nin respect of such Company SAR becomes vested pursuant to its applicable vesting schedule, but only if such Company Earnout Holder continues to provide services (whether\nas an employee, director or individual independent contractor) to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries through such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Earnout Shares that are\nnot earned by a Company Earnout Holder in respect of its Company Options or Company SARs on or before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date shall be forfeited without\nany consideration. Any Earnout Shares that are forfeited pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be reallocated to the other Company Earnout Holders who remain entitled to\nreceive Earnout Shares in accordance with their respective Earnout Pro Rata Shares.\nThese earnout shares have been categorized into two components: (i) the “Vested Shares” - those associated with Earnout Holders with vested equity at the closing of the\nMerger that will be earned upon achievement of the Earnout Milestones and (ii) the “Unvested Shares” - those associated with Earnout Holders with unvested equity at the\nclosing of the Merger that will be earned over the remaining service period with the Company on their unvested equity shares and upon achievement of the Earnout Milestones.\nThe Vested Shares, which represent 95% of the total Earnout Shares are classified as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations due to the variability in the number of Earnout Shares at settlement which could change upon a change of control event.\nThe Earnout arrangement contains a settlement provision that violates the indexation guidance under ASC 815-40. The Unvested Shares are equity-classified share-based\ncompensation to be recognized over time under ASC 718 due to the service component.\nAt the closing of the Merger on December 21, 2023, the earnout liability had an initial fair value of $27,109,777, which was recorded as a long-term liability and a reduction to\nadditional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the earnout liability had decreased to $5,133,428 as a result of the decline in our share\nprice since the closing of the Merger, which resulted in a gain due to the change in fair value of the earnout liability of $21,976,349 and is recorded on the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements for more information.\n110\nTable of Contents\n16. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table sets forth by level within the ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value hierarchy of the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities\nEarnout liability $ - $ - $ 5,133,428 $ 5,133,428\nSenior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes - - 2,825,366 2,825,366\nWarrant liability (Public Warrants) 646,428 - - 646,428\nWarrant liability (Private Warrants) - 21,557 - 21,557\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 646,428 $ 21,557 $ 7,958,794 $ 8,626,779\nThe estimated fair value of the earnout liability was determined using a Monte Carlo Model. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain\nstock price milestones including projected stock price, volatility, probability of meeting the federal law enforcement agency growth and risk-free rate. The following\nassumptions were used in the simulation at each valuation date:\nDecember 21, December 31,\n2023 2023\nStock price $ 6.49 $ 1.70\nRisk-free interest rate 3.87% 3.84%\nExpected term (in years) 5 5\nExpected volatility 76.40% 75.90%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nThe assumptions also included the probability of meeting the federal law enforcement agency growth milestone at 100%.\nThe initial estimated fair value of the Private Warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants is based on the listed price\nin an active market for such warrants while the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants continues to be measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with the key inputs being\ndirectly or indirectly observable from the Public Warrants listed price. The estimated fair value of the Private Warrants was determined using the following assumptions at each\nvaluation date:\nDecember 21, December 31,\n2023 2023\nStock price $ 6.49 $ 1.70\nRisk-free interest rate 3.87% 3.84%\nExpected term (in years) 5.01 4.98\nExpected volatility 13.90% 41.50%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nThe estimated fair value of the Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model that factors in potential outcomes\nbeing consummated, such as the convertible notes being repaid in cash and the convertible notes being converted to common stock. All of these scenarios take into\nconsideration the terms and conditions of the underlying convertible notes plus potential changes in the underlying value of the common stock. The following assumptions were\nused in the simulation:\n111\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n2023\nStock price $ 1.70\nEffective discount rate 12.95%\nExpected term (in years) 0.48 to 0.75\nExpected volatility 62.50%\nDividend yield 0%\nThere were no transfers of financial instruments between valuation levels during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n17. Earnings per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet Income (loss) $ 16,371,134 $ (487,493)\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic 13,671,376 13,387,344\nAdd: dilutive effect of stock options, SARs and Airship warrants 6,719,287 -\nDiluted 20,390,663 13,387,344\nIncome (loss) per share\nBasic $ 1.20 $ (0.04)\nDiluted $ 0.80 $ (0.04)\n112\nTable of Contents\nThe following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding for the periods presented as the effect would have been anti-dilutive:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nPublic Warrants 16,184,612 -\nPrivate Warrants 515,000 -\nConvertible debt 452,240 -\nWarrants 53,800 -\nOutstanding stock options - 4,162,067\nSARs - 1,758,100\n17,205,652 5,920,167\nThe 5,000,000 Earnout Shares are excluded from basic and diluted net loss per share as such shares are contingently issuable until the Company exceeds certain milestone\nthresholds that have not been achieved as of December 31, 2023.\nAs a result of the Merger, the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of net income (loss) per share have been retroactively converted by\napplying the conversion ratio.\n18. Subsequent Events\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company issued in a private placement an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note to Platinum Capital Partners Inc.\n(“Platinum”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000 (the “Platinum Convertible Note”). The Platinum Convertible Note amends and restates in its entirety the Senior Secured\nConvertible Promissory Note issued to Platinum in the principal amount of $2,000,000 on June 22, 2023. The repayment amount of the Platinum Convertible Note is1 10% of\nthe principal amount ($2,200,000) and matures in full on June 22, 2024. Interest accrues on the Platinum Convertible Note at the rate of 6% per annum calculated on the basis of\n360 days. At the option of Platinum, the principal amount of the Platinum Convertible Note plus any accrued but unpaid interest is convertible into shares of Common Stock at\na conversion price per share equal to the lower of (i) $3.69717, subject to appropriate adjustment as provided in the Platinum Convertible Note, and (ii) 65% of the VWAP for\nthe Common Stock for the preceding five trading days immediately prior to any conversion, but in no event below $2.27518, subject to appropriate adjustment as provided in the\nPlatinum Convertible Note. The Platinum Convertible Note contains “weighted average” anti-dilution protection for issuances of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock\nequivalents at a price less than the conversion price then in effect.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Platinum Convertible Note, the Company also issued to Platinum an Amended and Restated Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the\n“Platinum Warrant”) dated February 2, 2024 to purchase 189,334 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share of $3.69717. The term of the Platinum Warrant expires\non June 22, 2028. The Platinum Convertible Note may not be converted, and the Platinum Warrant may not be exercised, to the extent that after giving effect to such\nconversion and/or exercise, Platinum (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect\nto such conversion and/or exercise. On March 18, 2024, Platinum exercised the Platinum Warrant and received 137,367 shares of the Company’s common stock. Platinum\nforfeited 51,967 shares.\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company extended a lease in Moorestown, North Carolina. The Company leases3 ,621 square feet and the net monthly payment is $6,488. The lease\nexpires on July 29, 2024.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mark E. Scott, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, which provides for a base salary of\n$250,000 annually. Mr. Scott is also eligible to participate in annual performance-based bonus programs established by the Board or Compensation Committee, subject to the\nachievement of applicable performance criteria established by the Board or Compensation Committee, which shall be determined in good faith by the Board or Compensation\nCommittee. Mr. Scott was also granted options to purchase up to twenty five thousand (25,000) shares of Common Stock with an exercise price equal to $1.49, which options\nvested in full on the date of issuance.\nOn March 3, 2024, the Company granted a stock option to a director to purchase two hundred thousand shares 2(00,000) shares of Common Stock with an exercise price equal\nto $1.65, which options vest quarterly over four years and which expire on March 3, 2029.\nOn March 5, 2024, a private investor converted a senior secured convertible promissory note for $250,000 and interest into 70,502 shares of the Company’s common stock.\nOn March 5, 2024, a private investor converted a senior secured convertible promissory note for $350,000 and interest into 98,702 shares of the Company’s common stock.\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company issued 15,000 shares of common stock valued at $25,500 as of December 31, 2023 to MZHCI, LLC related to an investor relations\nconsulting agreement.\n113\nTable of Contents\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nDate: April 1, 2024 Airship AI Holdings, Inc.\n/s/ Victor Huang\nName: Victor Huang\nTitle: Chief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ Mark E.

Because the following is only a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. For a complete\ndescription, you should refer to the Charter and the Bylaws, copies of which are on file with the SEC. See \"Where You Can Find More Information”. Copies of these governing\ndocuments are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.5 is a part. Whenever we refer to particular sections or defined\nterms of the Charter or the Bylaws, such sections or defined terms are incorporated herein by reference and the statement in connection with such reference is made is qualified\nin its entirety by such reference. References to “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Airship AI Holdings, Inc., excluding, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context\nrequires, our subsidiaries.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Stock\nWe are a Delaware company and our affairs are governed by our Charter, our Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the “DGCL” or\n“Delaware Law” below, and the common law of the State of Delaware. The Charter authorizes the issuance of 205,000,000 shares, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of Common\nStock 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).\nCommon Stock\nVoting rights.Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders\ngenerally are entitled to vote. The holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Generally, all matters to be voted on by\nstockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders present in person or\nrepresented by proxy, voting together as a single class.\nDividend Rights.Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such\ndividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board out of funds legally available for such purposes.\nLiquidation Rights.In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to\nshare ratably in all assets remaining after payment of the Company’s debts and other liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of Preferred Stock or any class or series of\nstock having a preference over the Common Stock, then outstanding, if any.\nOther rights.The holders of Common Stock have no pre-emptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions\napplicable to the Common Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of the Common Stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of the Preferred\nStock that the Company may issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Charter authorizes the Board to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock. Unless required by law or any stock exchange, the authorized shares of Preferred Stock will\nbe available for issuance without further action by the holders of Common Stock. The Board has the discretion to determine the powers, preferences and relative, participating,\noptional and other special rights, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of Preferred Stock.\nThe issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders.\nAdditionally, the issuance of Preferred Stock may adversely affect the holders of Common Stock by restricting dividends on the Common Stock, diluting the voting power of\nthe Common Stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of the Common Stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of Preferred Stock could have an adverse\nimpact on the market price of the Common Stock, restricting dividends on the Company’s capital stock, diluting the voting power of Common Stock, impairing the liquidation\nrights of the Company’s capital stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. At present, there are no plans to issue any Preferred Stock.\nWarrants\n1\nPublic Warrants\nEach whole Public Warrant will entitle the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at\nany time commencing 30 days after the Closing, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on\na cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the Warrant Agreement) and such shares of Common Stock are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the\nsecurities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its Public Warrants only for a whole\nnumber of shares of Common Stock. This means only a whole Public Warrants may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. The Public Warrants will expire five years\nafter the Closing, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant\nexercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus\nrelating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No Public Warrants will be exercisable and the Company will\nnot be obligated to issue a share of Common Stock upon exercise of a Public Warrant unless the Common Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered,\nqualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two\nimmediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public Warrant, the holder of such Public Warrant will not be entitled to exercise such Public Warrant and\nsuch Public Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any Public Warrant.\nThe Company is registering the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants in a registration statement on Form S-1. In order to comply with the requirements\nof Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act following the Closing, under the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event\nlater than 15 business days, after the Closing, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a new registration statement covering the\nregistration under the Securities Act of the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and thereafter the Company will use its best efforts to cause the same\nto become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment or registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration\nor redemption of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement. If such post-effective amendment or registration statement covering the\nCommon Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the Closing, warrant holders may, until such time as there\nis an effective post-effective amendment or registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,\nexercise Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Common Stock\nis at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of\nthe Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)\n(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the\nCompany does not so elect, the Company will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In\nsuch event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Public Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) over the exercise price of the Public Warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361. The “fair market value” as used in this paragraph shall mean the average\nreported closing price of the Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.\n2\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:\n· in whole and not in part;\n· at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n· upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and\n· if, and only if, the closing price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20\ntrading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (which we refer to as the\n“Reference Value”).\nThe Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Common Stock\nissuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption\nperiod. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying\nsecurities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nWe have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant\nexercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its\nPublic Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Common Stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for\nadjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the\n$11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nRedemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n· in whole and not in part;\n· at a price of $0.10 per warrant;\n· upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, provided that holders will be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis prior to\nredemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table below, based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined\nbelow) of Common Stock except as otherwise described below;\n· if, and only if, the Reference Value equals or exceeds $10.00 per Public Share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise) or the\nexercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments”; and\n· if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share, the Private Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding\nPublic Warrants, as described above.\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the Public Warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless\nbasis. The numbers in the table below represent the number of shares of Common Stock that a warrant holder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, based on the “fair market value” of Common Stock on the corresponding redemption date (assuming holders elect to\nexercise their Public Warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on the volume weighted average price of the\nCommon Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, and the number of months that\nthe corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the warrants, each as set forth in the table below. the Company will provide warrant holders with the final fair\nmarket value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\n3\nThe share prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Public Warrant or\nthe exercise price of a Public Warrant is adjusted as set forth under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below.

For example, if the volume weighted average price of Common Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which\nthe notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $11.00 per share, and at such time there are 57 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose\nto, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.277 shares of Common Stock for each whole warrant. For an example where the exact fair market\nvalue and redemption date are not as set forth in the table above, if the volume weighted average price of Common Stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the\ndate on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $13.50 per share, and at such time there are 38 months until the expiration of the warrants,\nholders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.298 shares of Common Stock for each whole warrant. In no event will the Public\nWarrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 shares of Common Stock per warrant (subject to adjustment).\nFinally, as reflected in the table above, if the Public Warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they cannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for any shares of Common Stock.\n4\nThis redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding Public Warrants to be redeemed when the Common Stock is trading at or above $10.00 per share, which\nmay be at a time when the trading price of the Common Stock is below the exercise price of the Public Warrants. We have established this redemption feature to provide us with\nthe flexibility to redeem the Public Warrants without the Public Warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under “— Redemption of Public\nWarrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to exercise their Public Warrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to\nthis feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input as of the date of the prospectus. This\nredemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and therefore have certainty as to our capital structure as the\nwarrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed and we will be required to pay the applicable redemption price to warrant holders if we\nchoose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the Public Warrants if we determine it is in our best interest to do so. As\nsuch, we would redeem the Public Warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the warrants and pay the applicable\nredemption price to the warrant holders.\nAs stated above, we can redeem the Public Warrants when the Common Stock is trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below the exercise price of $11.50, because it will\nprovide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing warrant holders with the opportunity to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless\nbasis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to redeem the Public Warrants when the Common Stock is trading at a price below the exercise price of the Public\nWarrants, this could result in the warrant holders receiving fewer shares than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to exercise their warrants for shares of\nCommon Stock if and when the Common Stock was trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.\nNo fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down\nto the nearest whole number of the number of shares to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the Public Warrants are exercisable for a security other than shares\nof Common Stock pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the Public Warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as the Public Warrants become exercisable for a\nsecurity other than Common Stock, the Company (or the surviving company) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act the security\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants.\nRedemption Procedures\nIn the event that the Company determines to redeem the Public Warrants when the closing price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share or $10.00\nper share, pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of the Warrant Agreement, respectively, the Company will fix a date for the redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed\nby first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date to the registered holders of the Public Warrants to be redeemed at\ntheir last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or\nnot the registered holder received such notice.\nBeneficial Ownership Limitations\nA holder of a Public Warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the\nextent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of\n4.9% or 9.8% (as specified by the holder) of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.\n5\nAnti-dilution Adjustments.\nIf the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased by a share capitalization payable in shares of Common Stock, or by a sub-division of shares or other similar\nevent, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization, sub-division or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Public Warrant\nwill be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of securities entitling holders to purchase\nshares of Common Stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a share capitalization of a number of shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of\nCommon Stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for\nCommon Stock) and (ii) the quotient of (x) the price per share of Common Stock paid in such rights offering and (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights\noffering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, in determining the price payable for Common Stock, there will be taken into account any\nconsideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price\nof Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade on the\napplicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\nIn addition, if the Company, at any time while the Public Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to all\nor substantially all of the holders of the Common Stock on account of such Common Stock (or other securities into which the Public Warrants are convertible), other than (a) as\ndescribed above or (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid on the\nCommon Stock during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution does not exceed $0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any other\nadjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price or to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on\nexercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, then the warrant\nexercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets\npaid on each share of Common Stock in respect of such event.\nIf the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share sub-division or reclassification of Common Stock or other\nsimilar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share sub-division, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Common\nStock issuable on exercise of each Public Warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nWhenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be\nadjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares purchasable upon\nthe exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such\nshares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and\nthat does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another\ncorporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the Public\nWarrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Public Warrants and in lieu of the Common\nStock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares or other securities or property\n(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the\nPublic Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their Public Warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a\nright of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other\nassets for which each Public Warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such\nconsolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders under\ncircumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)\n(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the\nExchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the\nExchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, the holder of a Public Warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or\nother property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrant holder had exercised the Public Warrant prior to the expiration of such\ntender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Common Stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to\nadjustment (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the Warrant Agreement. If\nless than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Common Stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of shares in the successor entity that is listed for\ntrading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and\nif the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced\nas specified in the Warrant Agreement based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price\nreduction is to provide additional value to holders of the Public Warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the Public Warrants pursuant to\nwhich the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the Public Warrants.\n6\nThe Public Warrants are issued in registered form under a Warrant Agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and BYTS. The\nWarrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or to correct\nany defective provision or mistake, including to conform the provisions of the Warrant Agreement to the description of the terms of the Public Warrants and the Warrant\nAgreement, (ii) adjusting the provisions relating to cash dividends on shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the Warrant Agreement or (iii) adding or changing any\nprovisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Warrant Agreement as the parties to the Warrant Agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the\nparties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the Public Warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-\noutstanding Public Warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of Public Warrants, and, solely with respect to any\namendment to the terms of the Private Warrants, 50% of the then outstanding Private Warrants. You should review a copy of the Warrant Agreement, which is filed as an\nexhibit to the annual report, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the Public Warrants.\nThe Public Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on\nthe reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by\ncertified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of shares of\nCommon Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Common Stock. After the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of\nthe Public Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. If, upon exercise of the Public Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a\nshare, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the warrant holder.\nExclusive Forum\nThe Warrant Agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement,\nincluding under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any\nobjection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the Warrant Agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any\ninterest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of\nwhich is within the scope the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction\nof the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement\naction”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as\nagent for such warrant holder.\n7\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes, which may discourage such lawsuits\nand result in increased costs to warrant holders to bring a lawsuit. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Warrant Agreement inapplicable or unenforceable\nwith respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and\nboard.\nPrivate Warrants\nThe Private Warrants (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the Closing\n(except, among other limited exceptions, to BYTS’ officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor) and they will not be redeemable by the\nCompany so long as they are held by the Sponsor, members of the Sponsor or their permitted transferees (except as set forth under “— Warrants — Public\nWarrants — Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00”). The Sponsor or its permitted transferees have the option to\nexercise the Private Warrants on a cashless basis. Except as described below, the Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as\npart of the Units in BYTS’ IPO. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the\nCompany and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in BYTS’s IPO.\nExcept as described above under “— Public Warrants — Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Common Stock equals or exceeds $10.00,” if holders of the\nPrivate Warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Common\nStock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the Private Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of\nthe Common Stock (as defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” means the average reported closing price of\nthe Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that\nwe have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees is because it was not known at the\ntime of the IPO whether the Sponsor would be affiliated with us following a business combination. If the Sponsor remains affiliated with the Company, its ability to sell the\nCompany’s securities in the open market will be significantly limited. The Company has policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling securities except during specific\nperiods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell the Company’s securities, an insider cannot trade in the Company’s securities if he or\nshe is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their Public Warrants and sell the shares received upon such\nexercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities.\n8\nEXHIBIT 31.1\nCERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nPURSUANT TO\nEXCHANGE ACT RULES 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a),\nAS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO\nSECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\nI, Victor Huang, certify that:\n1.
