The net leverage for each middle-market loan portfolio company is calculated based on PSEC’s investment in the capital structure of such portfolio\ncompany, with a maximum limit of 10.0x adjusted EBITDA. This calculation excludes debt subordinate to PSEC’s position within the capital structure because PSEC’s exposure to\ninterest payment and principal repayment risk is limited beyond that point. Additionally, subordinated structured notes, other structured credit, real estate investments, investments\nfor which EBITDA is not available, and equity investments, for which principal repayment is not fixed, are also not included in the calculation. The calculation does not exceed 10.0x\nadjusted EBITDA for any individual investment because 10.0x captures the highest level of risk to PSEC. Middle-Market Portfolio Net Leverage provides PSEC with some guidance\nas to PSEC’s exposure to the interest payment and principal repayment risk of PSEC’s overall debt portfolio. PSEC monitors its Middle-Market Portfolio Net Leverage on a quarterly\nbasis.\nMiddle-Market Portfolio EBITDA is used by PSEC to supplement Middle-Market Portfolio Net Leverage and generally indicates a portfolio company’s ability to make interest\npayments and repay principal. Middle-Market Portfolio EBITDA is calculated using the EBITDA of each of PSEC’s middle-market loan portfolio companies, weighted based on the\ncurrent fair market value of the related investments. The calculation provides PSEC with insight into profitability and scale of the portfolio companies within our overall debt\ninvestments.\nThese calculations include addbacks that are typically negotiated and documented in the applicable investment documents, including but not limited to transaction costs, share-\nbased compensation, management fees, foreign currency translation adjustments and other nonrecurring transaction expenses.\nTogether, Middle-Market Portfolio Net Leverage and Middle-Market Portfolio EBITDA assist PSEC in assessing the likelihood that PSEC will timely receive interest and principal\npayments. However, these calculations are not meant to substitute for an analysis of PSEC’s our underlying portfolio company debt investments, but to supplement such analysis.\n30\nNON-CYCLICAL INVESTMENTS\nNon-Cyclical investments provide insight into the composition of an investment portfolio. Non-cyclical investments produce or distribute a good or service with recurring demand,\nand therefore are not correlated with the business cycle volatility.\nNon-Cyclical investments are calculated as a percentage of a total investment portfolio across the peers described below measured by fair market value.\nBDC peers use varying industry classifications to define their respective portfolio’s. PSEC management views the following industries as non-cyclical:\n• PSEC industry classifications: Capital markets, commercial services & supplies, consumer finance, diversified consumer services, diversified telecommunication services,\nequity real estate investment trusts (REITs), food products, health care providers & services, health care technology, interactive media & services, IT services, media, personal\ncare products, pharmaceuticals, professional services, software, and structured finance.\n• BDC A industry classifications: Commercial services & supplies, containers and packaging, diversified consumer services, diversified telecommunication services, electric\nutilities, health care equipment & supplies, health care providers & services, health care technology, insurance, IT services, media, professional services, and software.\n• BDC B industry classifications: Beverages, biotechnology, capital markets, commercial services and supplies, containers and packaging, diversified consumer services,\ndiversified telecommunications services, food and staples retailing, food products, healthcare equipment and supplies, healthcare providers and services, health care\ntechnology, household products, insurance, IT services, life sciences tools & services, media, personal products, pharmaceuticals, professional services, software, and water\nutilities.\n• BDC C industry classifications: Advertising and media, buildings and real estate, business services, consumer products, containers and packaging, education, food and\nbeverage, healthcare equipment and services, healthcare providers and services, healthcare technology, household products, insurance, internet software and services,\nprofessional services, and telecommunications.\n• BDC D industry classifications: Software & services, healthcare services, commercial & professional services, insurance services, consumer durables & apparel, consumer\nservices, media & entertainment, food & beverage, and consumer staples distribution and retail.\n• BDC E industry classifications: Commercial & professional services, consumer durables & apparel, consumer services, consumer staples distribution and retail, equity real\nestate investment trusts (REITs), food, beverage & tobacco, health care equipment & services, household & personal products, insurance, media & entertainment,\npharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences, software & services, and telecommunication services.\n31"

Founded in 2004, Prospect’s over 20-year\nhistory began before, and Prospect invested during and across, the Great Financial Crisis, unlike the vast\nbulk of other BDCs with much shorter histories.\nStrategy Focus: Risk reduction, capital preservation, and avoidance of “yield chasing” investments.\n82% of portfolio in first lien, secured, or underlying secured assets – including an over 7% increase in\nfirst lien loan allocation vs. 9/30/2023.\nMulti-Line BDC: Low cross-correlation strategies – middle-market lending (52%), middle-market\nlending / buyout (19%), real estate (19%), and subordinated structured notes (6%).(1)\nTrack Record: Invested over $21B across over 400 investments (over 300 exited) during 20-year\nhistory.\nRecurring Income: 94% of total investment income from interest income for the quarter ended\n9/30/2024.\nSuccessful Credit Facility Closing: On 6/28/2024, Prospect successfully completed an amended and\nextended credit facility with a new 5-year maturity. The credit facility has $2.1 billion of commitments\nfrom 48 commercial banks, an increase of $168 million from 3/31/2024.\nCash Distributions to Shareholders: Prospect will have distributed $21.25 per share since 2004 to\noriginal common shareholders, representing 2.6x September 2024 common NAV per share and 4.1x the\nstock price on 11/6/2024, and aggregating $4.4 billion in cumulative distributions to all common\nshareholders (since inception through our January 2025 declared distribution and taking into account past\ndistributions and our current share count for declared distributions).\nHigher Total Returns: As of Prospect’s latest fiscal year end in June 2024, Prospect has higher total\nreturns compared to the publicly-traded BDC median based on the 5-year total change in NAV plus\ndividends.\n5-Year Total Increase in NAV plus Dividends(2)\n37.5%\n37.0%\n37.0%\n36.5%\n36.0%\n35.5%\n35.5%\n35.0%\nPublicly-Traded BDC Median PSEC\nProspect Highlights\nPerformance: Since FY2020, Prospect has increased total equity to over $5 billion.\n* Information related to past performance, while potentially helpful as an evaluation tool, is not indicative of future results.\nProspect’s actual FY2025 results may differ materially.\nNon-Accrual Loan Rate: Prospect’s non-accrual loans have remained low at 0.5% as of\n9/30/2024.(3)\n100.0%\n90.0%\n80.0%\n70.0%\n60.0%\n50.0%\n40.0%\n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n0.3% 0.5% 0.2% 1.1% 0.2% 0.2% 0.4% 0.3% 0.5%\n0.0%\nSep-22 Dec-22 Mar-23 Jun-23 Sep-23 Dec-23 Mar-24 Jun-24 Sep-24\nProspect Highlights\nControl Companies and PIK Interest: Prospect has made investments in multiple\ncontrol companies since inception 20 years ago. Prospect makes senior and secured yield-\nproducing loans and control equity investments in operating companies across various industries.\n▪\nThe majority of these investments are in senior and secured debt.\n▪\nProspect’s control companies have seen overall net appreciation, with a fair market value of\n113% of cost (representing $418M of net unrealized gain) as of 9/30/2024.(4)\n▪\nProspect continues to invest in certain of these companies through incremental investments\nand payment-in-kind interest (“PIK”).\n▪\nPIK can be an efficient funding mechanism for certain portfolio companies making accretive\ninvestments in their business, with valuations typically above Prospect’s debt on-accrual cost\nbasis.\n▪\nUse of proceeds includes tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, facility modernization,\nworking capital, and organic growth, among others.\n▪\nFor FY2024 and FY2025 YTD, Prospect’s current portfolio of control companies accounted\nfor the majority of Prospect’s total PIK.\nNational Property REIT Corp. (“NPRC”): Prospect started investing in real estate 12\nyears ago, and its portfolio company REIT has invested in 110 properties, primarily multifamily\nproperties with value-add potential.\n▪\nFrom 1/1/2020 through 9/30/2024, Prospect has invested $373M capital into NPRC (net of\ncapital repayments).\n▪\nOver that same time period, NPRC has made $835M of new investments, including acquiring\n27 new multifamily properties and making value-add investments in existing properties.\n▪\nNPRC’s diversified portfolio includes 61 real estate properties with standalone non-recourse\nfinancing, strong rent and net operating income (NOI) growth.\n▪\nNPRC focuses on various classes of developed and occupied real estate properties that generate\ncurrent yields, including multi-family properties, student housing, and senior living, with a\nprioritization of properties that have historically attractive occupancy rates and recurring cash\nflow generation.\n▪\nNPRC has exited 49 properties at an average net realized IRR to NPRC of 24.4% and average\nrealized cash multiple of invested capital of 2.5x as of 9/30/2024.\nProspect Highlights\nDividend Coverage (9/30/2024 Quarter):\nDividend Coverage\n331%\n108%\nPreferred Dividend Coverage Pro Forma Common Dividend Coverage*\n* Pro forma common dividend coverage uses 9/30/2024 quarterly net investment income, is pro forma for the $0.045 monthly\ndividend rate authorized on 11/5/2024, and is net of preferred dividends.\nProspect Highlights\nIndependent Valuations: Prospect continues to employ a rigorous and independent\nvaluation process since inception in 2004.\n▪\nEvery investment is valued quarterly and has been valued since inception at fair value by a\nthird-party.\n▪\nThird-party valuation agents complete a review of all investments on an independent basis\n(i.e., not merely on a “positive / negative assurance review” or “sampling” basis).\n▪\nAll valuations are approved by Prospect’s 100% independent Audit Committee and majority\nindependent Board.\nOther Prospect Highlights:\n▪\nProspect has strong insider ownership of 27% ($950 million of net asset value) as of 9/30/2024.\n▪\nProspect has multiple investment strategies, 117 portfolio companies, and 33 different\nindustries (with a particular focus on less cyclical industries).\n▪\nProspect has only 0.6% of total assets as unfunded commitments as of 9/30/2024.\n▪\nProspect’s net debt leverage has remained low at 0.44x as of 9/30/2024 (calculated as total\nprincipal debt minus cash and cash equivalents divided by total equity that includes preferred\nstock).\n▪\nProspect has a laddered liability structure with long-term matched-book funding.\n▪\nProspect has access to diversified funding sources across multiple investor bases with an\nemphasis on unsecured term debt, representing 76% of all Prospect indebtedness, as of\n9/30/2024.\n▪\nProspect is a BDC industry innovator with a long list of firsts by a BDC – convertible bond,\nprogram notes, bond ATM, equity ATM, BDC acquisition, listed perpetual preferred,\nprogrammatic perpetual preferred, and others.\n▪\nProspect has 48 bank lenders (which recently extended Prospect's credit facility 5 years out to\n2029).\n▪\nProspect has 64% and $4.9B of assets that are completely unencumbered. Prospect Capital\nFunding LLC is the borrower of the secured revolving credit facility.\n▪\nProspect has been investment grade rated for 15 years and currently has 5 investment grade\ncorporate credit ratings, the most of any BDC (with Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, DBRS\nMorningstar, Kroll, and Egan-Jones).\no Each of these rating agencies have affirmed these ratings in 2024.\n▪\nProspect has retired multiple upcoming bond maturities and, as of today, has no debt maturing\nduring the remainder of calendar year 2024 and only $160 million of remaining bond maturities\nuntil 2026.\n▪\nProspect has successfully issued in an array of markets, including multiple institutional bond\nissuances in 2021 at 3.364-3.706% coupons when interest rates were lower, and choosing to\nwait for lower rates to potentially issue such paper (favoring other markets in the interim) with\ndisciplined balance sheet management.\nProspect Highlights\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND DISCLAIMERS\nCertain statements made by us herein that are not historical facts or that relate to future plans,\nevents or performances are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities\nlaws.
