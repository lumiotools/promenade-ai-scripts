(Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update. \n\n“The team at Kezar has made great progress towards completing the double-blind portion of the PORTOLA trial as we prepare for a data release in first half of 2025,” said Chris Kirk, PhD, Kezar’s Chief Executive Officer. “There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis, and we are focused on bringing zetomipzomib to patients living with this life-threatening disease. In addition, we are working to understand the safety events that occurred in the PALIZADE trial in lupus nephritis, including deaths that occurred in both the placebo and drug arms, so that we can provide patients and physicians appropriate guidance during our ongoing and future clinical trials.” \n\n**Zetomipzomib: Selective Immunoproteasome Inhibitor**\n\n_PORTOLA_ – Phase 2a clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov): [NCT05569759](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05569759%3Fterm%3DKZR-616%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D5&esheet=54151082&newsitemid=20241112979408&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05569759&index=2&md5=832d1444df9c0f4eb5022a95ab7808e5)) \n\n  * PORTOLA is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH that are insufficiently responding to standard of care or have relapsed. The study has completed enrollment of 24 patients, randomized (2:1) to receive 60 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo in addition to background therapy for 24 weeks, with a protocol-suggested steroid taper. The primary efficacy endpoint will measure the proportion of patients who achieve a complete biochemical response by Week 24 measured as normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) values (if elevated at baseline), with steroid dose levels not higher than baseline. \n  * Kezar plans to report topline data in the first half of 2025. In October, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended that the PORTOLA trial proceed without modification. The IDMC examined safety data from all patients enrolled in the trial, including data from patients who completed the 24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP) and continued to the open-label extension (OLE) portion of the trial that includes an additional 24 weeks of treatment. To date, no Grade 4 or 5 serious adverse events (SAEs) have been observed in this trial, which is being conducted at clinical trial sites in the United States. This recommendation occurred following the FDA’s clinical hold on the PALIZADE trial, as described below. \n  * Following the recommendation made by the IDMC, the FDA notified Kezar that it is allowing enrolled patients to complete the DBTP of the PORTOLA trial without modification. However, the FDA has placed a partial clinical hold on PORTOLA requiring that the four remaining patients currently in the DBTP should not continue to the OLE portion of the trial. Patients who are currently participating in the OLE may continue treatment on zetomipzomib, but their prednisone dosage may not be tapered below 5 mg/day, and any patients who tapered below this amount will raise their prednisone back to 5 mg/day. \n\n\n\n_PALIZADE_ – Phase 2b clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov): [NCT05781750](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05781750%3Fterm%3DPALIZADE%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&esheet=54151082&newsitemid=20241112979408&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05781750&index=3&md5=c40ae68514de95e3cac1516354dae826)) \n\n  * In October, Kezar made the strategic decision to terminate the PALIZADE Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with active LN and focus clinical development efforts on zetomipzomib in AIH. PALIZADE was placed on full clinical hold following the recommendation of the PALIZADE IDMC after its assessment of four Grade 5 (fatal) SAEs that occurred in patients enrolled in the Philippines and Argentina (including one patient on placebo). \n  * Kezar is unblinding the trial and will perform a full investigation into all safety events from the study. 84 patients were enrolled in PALIZADE as of termination, and Kezar expects to report available data from PALIZADE at a later date. \n\n\n\n_MISSION_ – Kezar will present results from the open-label Phase 1b/2 MISSION trial in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with or without LN showing zetomipzomib demonstrated improvements in SLE/LN disease measures and biomarkers in patients with highly active SLE or nephrotic range proteinuria at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024, which is taking place November 14 – 19, 2024, in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Business Updates**\n\nIn October, Kezar effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock (Reverse Stock Split) to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share required to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of Kezar’s outstanding common stock from 72,962,220 shares to 7,296,222 shares, subject to adjustment due to the issuance of full shares in lieu of fractional shares. \n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities** totaled $148.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $201.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operations to advance clinical-stage programs. \n  * **Research and development (R &D) expenses** for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by $7.5 million to $16.2 million, compared to $23.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the Company’s strategic restructuring in October 2023 to prioritize its clinical-stage programs, reducing personnel-related costs and spending in its early-stage research activities. The decrease was partially offset by the increased clinical trial costs related to the PALIZADE and PORTOLA trials. \n  * **General and administrative (G &A) expenses** for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by $3.1 million to $5.7 million compared to $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in legal and professional service expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation. \n  * **Net loss** for the third quarter of 2024 was $20.3 million, or $2.78 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $23.1 million, or $3.18 per basic and diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. The weighted-average shares used to compute net loss per basic and diluted common share have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-ten reverse stock split completed on October 29, 2024. \n  * **Total shares of common stock outstanding** were 7.3 million shares as of September 30, 2024, after taking into effect the retroactive application of the one-for-ten reverse stock split completed on October 29, 2024. \n\n\n\n**About Kezar Life Sciences**\n\nKezar Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases. Zetomipzomib, a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial for autoimmune hepatitis. This product candidate also has the potential to address multiple chronic immune-mediated diseases.

(Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases, today announced that it will conduct a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one-for-ten (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 29, 2024 (the “Effective Time”). The Company's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on October 30, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split is part of the Company's plan to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share required to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, among other benefits. \n\nThe Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 18, 2024 (the “Annual Meeting”) to be effected at the Board's discretion within approved parameters. Following the Annual Meeting, the final ratio was approved by the Company's Board on September 23, 2024. \n\nThe Reverse Stock Split reduces the number of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock from 72,962,220 shares to 7,296,222 shares, subject to adjustment due to the issuance of full shares in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the Company's outstanding equity awards and the number of shares issuable under the Company's equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable. There will be no change to the number of authorized shares or the par value per share. \n\n**Information for KZR Stockholders**\n\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, every ten pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will become one share of common stock. The Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will serve as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. \n\nStockholders of record holding pre-split shares of the Company's common stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Those stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or in \"street name\" will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to each broker's particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. \n\nNo fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. \n\n**About Kezar Life Sciences**\n\nKezar Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases.

(Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has unanimously rejected the previously disclosed unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Concentra Biosciences, LLC (“Concentra”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Kezar for cash consideration of $1.10 per share, plus a contingent value right that represents the right to receive 80% of the net proceeds from any out-license or disposition of Kezar’s development programs or intellectual property. \n\nAfter careful consideration and with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors, the Board unanimously concluded that the Concentra proposal substantially undervalues the Company. The proposal would result in an implied equity value for Kezar stockholders that is materially below Kezar’s available liquidity and fails to provide adequate value to reflect the significant potential of zetomipzomib as a therapeutic candidate. Accordingly, the Board determined that the proposal is not in the best interests of Kezar and its stockholders. In addition, in response to Concentra’s proposal and Concentra and its affiliates’ rapid accumulation of 9.9% of Kezar’s outstanding common stock, the Board has adopted a limited duration stockholder rights plan, effective immediately (the “Rights Plan”). \n\n“Kezar continues to experience a significant and ongoing dislocation in the trading price of its common stock which does not reflect its fundamental value,” said Graham Cooper, Chairman of the Board. “We intend the Rights Plan to enable all of our stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment. The Rights Plan should reduce the likelihood that any person or group gains control of Kezar through open market accumulation without paying all stockholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of all stockholders.” \n\nThe Rights Plan does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal, including from Concentra, if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Kezar and all of its stockholders. The Rights Plan is similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies in comparable circumstances, and does not contain any dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future Board to redeem the rights. \n\nIn connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of Kezar’s common stock as of the close of business on October 28, 2024, the record date. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group (an “Acquiring Person”) acquires or launches a tender or exchange offer to acquire beneficial ownership (which includes certain synthetic equity interests) of 10% or more of Kezar’s outstanding common stock (15% in the case of a passive institutional investor as described in the Rights Plan). Any stockholders with beneficial ownership of Kezar’s outstanding common stock above the applicable threshold as of the time of this announcement are grandfathered at their current ownership levels but are not permitted to increase their ownership without triggering the Rights Plan.

(Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases, today announced key clinical development updates. \n\nThe IDMC overseeing the PORTOLA Phase 2a clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH recommended that the trial may proceed without modification following its third scheduled meeting. The IDMC examined safety data from all patients enrolled in the trial, including data from patients who completed the blinded treatment period and continued to the open-label extension portion of the trial which includes an additional 24 weeks of treatment. Three members of the IDMC, including the committee chair, are also members of the IDMC overseeing the PALIZADE study of zetomipzomib in LN. To date, no Grade 4 or 5 serious adverse events (SAEs) have been observed in the PORTOLA trial which is being conducted at clinical sites in the United States. Kezar has completed enrollment of PORTOLA and plans to report topline data in the first half of 2025. \n\nKezar has also made the strategic decision to terminate the PALIZADE Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with active LN and focus clinical development efforts of zetomipzomib in AIH, a rare disease with a significant unmet medical need. PALIZADE was recently placed on clinical hold following the recommendation of the IDMC after its assessment of four Grade 5 (fatal) SAEs that occurred in patients enrolled in the Philippines and Argentina (including one patient on placebo). Kezar will unblind the trial and perform a full investigation into all safety events from the study. As of termination, 84 patients were enrolled, and Kezar will report available data from PALIZADE at a later date. \n\n“The IDMC recommendation to continue the PORTOLA trial without modification strengthens our confidence in the potential for zetomipzomib to be a meaningful treatment for patients living with autoimmune hepatitis,” said Chris Kirk, PhD, Kezar’s Chief Executive Officer. “While we are disappointed to discontinue our development program in LN, we would like to thank the investigators, patients and their families for their participation in the PALIZADE trial. This decision was difficult given the favorable safety profile and clinical activity data we have presented from the MISSION study and rapid enrollment to PALIZADE. However, a focused development effort in AIH extends our cash runway and provides flexibility as we work to bring zetomipzomib forward as a treatment for patients living with this life-threatening disease.” \n\nKezar’s unaudited cash position is approximately $148 million, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of September 30, 2024. This cash estimate is a preliminary estimate and based on information currently available to management, and this estimate could change. \n\n**About PORTOLA**\n\nPORTOLA is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH that are insufficiently responding to standard of care or have relapsed. The study has completed enrollment of 24 patients, randomized (2:1) to receive 60 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo in addition to background therapy for 24 weeks, with a protocol-suggested steroid taper. The primary efficacy endpoint will measure the proportion of patients who achieve a complete biochemical response by Week 24 measured as normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) values (if elevated at baseline), with steroid dose levels not higher than baseline. \n\n**About Autoimmune Hepatitis**\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and tissue damage, severely impacting patients’ physical health and quality of life. Lifelong maintenance therapy is required to avoid relapse and burdensome adverse effects. If left untreated, AIH can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States, AIH affects approximately 140,000 individuals, with incidence rates increasing. The cause of this condition remains unclear, with females affected four times as often as males. Currently, standard of care treatment for AIH is chronic, immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids that frequently cause life-altering side effects, including diabetes, osteoporotic fractures and cataracts. There is a significant need for treatment regimens that reduce or remove the need for chronic immunosuppression from using corticosteroids. \n\n**About Kezar Life Sciences**\n\nKezar Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases.

(Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a novel small molecule to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases, today announced that it was informed via teleconference with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the zetomipzomib Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) has been placed on clinical hold. This action follows Kezar’s communication to the FDA that Kezar was voluntarily suspending enrollment and dosing in its Phase 2b PALIZADE clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with active LN at the recommendation of the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The IDMC’s recommendation followed their review of emerging safety data, including an assessment of four Grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse events (SAEs) that have occurred during the course of the trial in patients enrolled in the Philippines and Argentina. The FDA indicated that they will provide an official clinical hold letter to Kezar within 30 days. \n\n“We are steadfastly committed to patient safety and have directed our efforts to investigating these cases as we look to continue the zetomipzomib development program,” said Chris Kirk, PhD, Kezar’s Chief Executive Officer. “At this time, our zetomipzomib IND for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis is unaffected. Our Phase 2a PORTOLA clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with autoimmune hepatitis remains active, and we have not observed any Grade 4 or 5 SAEs in the PORTOLA trial to date.” \n\n**About Lupus Nephritis**\n\nLN is one of the most serious complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN is a disease comprising a spectrum of vascular, glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions and develops in approximately 50% of SLE patients within 10 years of their initial diagnosis. LN is associated with considerable morbidity, including an increased risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplantation and an increased risk of death. There are limited approved therapies for the treatment of LN. Management typically consists of induction therapy to achieve remission and long-term maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. \n\n**About Kezar Life Sciences**\n\nKezar Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases.
