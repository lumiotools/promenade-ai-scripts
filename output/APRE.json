(Nasdaq: APRE) (“Aprea”, or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on precision oncology through synthetic lethality, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“We continue to make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline of two clinical stage therapeutic candidates as well as strengthening our clinical team,” said Oren Gilad, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aprea. “We are ahead of schedule with the enrollment of the Phase 1 ACESOT-1051 trial evaluating our next generation WEE1 inhibitor, APR-1051. Preliminary results at subtherapeutic doses demonstrate the product to be well-tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. APR-1051 has been designed to limit off target toxicity and, based on its unique characteristics, we believe it will be best-in-class. Active enrollment is also ongoing in the Phase 1/2a ABOYA-119 study evaluating ATRN-119, our first-in-class macrocyclic ATR inhibitor. To optimize dosing and scheduling we added a twice-daily dosing regimen.”\n\n**Key Business Updates and Potential Upcoming Key Milestones**\n\n**ACESOT-1051: A Biomarkers Focused, Phase 1 Trial of Oral WEE1 inhibitor, APR-1051**\n\n  * APR-1051 is a potent and selective small molecule that has been designed to potentially solve tolerability challenges of the class and may achieve greater clinical activity than other WEE1 programs currently in development. Aprea is advancing APR-1051 as monotherapy in cancers with Cyclin E over-expression, as well as other biomarkers that may predict sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition. Cancers over-expressing Cyclin E represent a high unmet medical need. Patients with Cyclin E over-expression have poor prognosis and, currently, have no effective therapies available.\n  * Enrollment is ongoing in the ACESOT-1051 (A Multi-Center Evaluation of WEE1 Inhibitor in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors, APR-1051) Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating single-agent APR-1051 in advanced solid tumors harboring cancer-associated gene alterations. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 study are to measure safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetics, preliminary efficacy according to RECIST or PCWG3 criteria; pharmacodynamic parameters are exploratory objectives.\n  * In October 2024, preliminary findings from the ACESOT-1051 trial were reported in a poster at the [EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zya5HIEPx3TxCQZs_pmMI0TZ6VI6RNF4iWVnLLS15A99YDm9zcA_9I4F1kdSmMQj4nbyLwSsnPxlGNaL3xj_NEwDuKTLABz5if1dJa6tVY42a56dpqxbdr6HS_vlZu4O_3BH_wggjq8SddMROF-a2JVFH_LVcIJS35EGQcJprDHCHwBF2IrlWmnnIBN2dpTJQAfGj6EwtpiGLc5-aJseB3ZsKgTnlmzXztSQeVSPdgoBfl2NN5vRy8aQjNTQN9WyBIDkQ0REQ21kQe99UDZhlGJHwpN-FR3fD67hr4TMi-t-iqFkb8oba1rXsNXonqip_ct8WzHgtTBNbzZyaCI-Mwv552QEdyqRVIl8eDBi6oZDpaUBWHb6d7DKx_ot95a3YazWInkGyS7Lqcw4Fz2ThyWV8I16SyC3YJGWySBZ1Bk=), in Barcelona, Spain. As of October 7, 2024, three patients were enrolled (sub-therapeutic doses of 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg) in the first three Cohorts with data available on two of these patients. Preliminary results to date have demonstrated that APR-1051 is well-tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The poster can be viewed on Aprea’s corporate website [here](https://ir.aprea.com/static-files/5b6a4bc9-a06a-47bb-91c6-e65e643ff8de).\n  * Cohort 3 has been cleared ahead of schedule, with no safety concerns noted. Accelerated titration is complete and, in November 2024, the trial begun enrolling at Cohort 4 (50 mg) within the BOIN (Bayesian Optimal Interval) design.\n  * Preliminary efficacy data from ACESOT-1051 are expected in the first half of 2025. For more information, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT06260514](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06260514?term=NCT06260514&rank=1).\n\n\n\n**ABOYA-119: Ongoing Clinical Trial Evaluating ATR inhibitor, ATRN-119**\n\n  * ATRN-119 is a potent and highly selective first-in-class macrocyclic ATR inhibitor, designed to be used in patients with mutations in DDR-related genes. Cancers with mutations in DDR-related genes represent a high unmet medical need. Patients with DDR-related gene mutations have a poor prognosis and, currently, there are no effective therapies available for them.\n  * ATRN-119 is currently being evaluated in the open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ABOYA-119 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors having at least one mutation in a defined panel of DDR-related genes. The primary endpoint of this Phase 1 trial is the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ATRN-119 when administered orally on a continuous schedule.\n  * An update from ABOYA-119 was provided in a poster at the [EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zya5HIEPx3TxCQZs_pmMI0TZ6VI6RNF4iWVnLLS15A99YDm9zcA_9I4F1kdSmMQj4nbyLwSsnPxlGNaL3xj_NEwDuKTLABz5if1dJa6tVY42a56dpqxbdr6HS_vlZu4O_3BH_wggjq8SddMROF-a2JVFH_LVcIJS35EGQcJprDHCHwBF2IrlWmnnIBN2dpTJQAfGj6EwtpiGLc5-aJseB3ZsKgTnlmzXztSQeVSPdgoBfl2NN5vRy8aQjNTQN9WyBIDkQ0REQ21kQe99UDZhlGJHwpN-FR3fD67hr4TMi-t-iqFkb8oba1rXsNXonqip_ct8WzHgtTBNbzZyaCI-Mwv552QEdyqRVIl8eDBi6oZDpaUBWHb6d7DKx_ot95a3YazWInkGyS7Lqcw4Fz2ThyWV8I16SyC3YJGWySBZ1Bk=) on October 25, 2024. Patients are currently being enrolled at dose level 6 (800mg once daily) in the dose escalation part of the trial. As of October 2, 2024, 14 of 20 patients experienced adverse events (AEs) considered to be possibly/probably related to ATRN-119. No related SAE or grade 4-5 AEs have been observed. No signs of hematological toxicity have been registered and no DLTs have been observed to date. Preliminary signs of clinical benefit were observed in two patients treated at the 50 mg and 200 mg dose level. A copy of the poster can be viewed [here](https://ir.aprea.com/static-files/a9cffceb-d124-4959-a8d9-24b45fee6814).\n  * In order to optimize dosing and scheduling early in the development process, a protocol amendment has been submitted to add dose level 9 (1500 mg once daily) and twice-daily (400mg to 750mg) dosing. The addition of twice-daily dosing is supported by the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug and the favorite safety profile observed to date. The dose escalation for the once-daily and the twice-daily schedules will be studied independently. Under the current updated protocol, the Company anticipates the ABOYA-119 Phase 1 readout to be available in the second half of 2025.\n  * For more information, please refer to [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) [NCT04905914](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04905914). \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * In October 2024, the Company engaged Philippe Pultar, MD as senior medical advisor to support the development and advancement of APR-1051. Dr. Pultar is a seasoned pharmaceutical executive with extensive experience in oncology. He was most recently employed at Zentalis Pharmaceuticals where he played a key role in the strategy and execution of the global clinical development of azenosertib, a WEE1 inhibitor.\n\n\n\n**Select Financial Results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported cash and cash equivalents of $26.2 million, compared to $21.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported an operating loss of $4.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.5 million in the comparable period in 2023.\n  * Grant revenue primarily from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\n  * Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $2.8 million, compared to approximately $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase was primarily due to an increase in costs related to the ABOYA-119 clinical trial to evaluate ATRN-119 and personnel costs. These were offset in part by a decrease in costs related to IND enabling studies for ATRN-1051.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $1.6 million, compared to approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in insurance costs.\n  * The Company reported a net loss of $3.8 million ($0.64 per basic share) on approximately 5.9 million weighted-average common shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million ($0.86 per basic share) on approximately 3.7 million weighted average common shares outstanding for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Aprea**\n\nAprea Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, focused on precision oncology through synthetic lethality. The Company’s lead program is ATRN-119, a clinical-stage small molecule ATR inhibitor in development for solid tumor indications.

So far, patients have been enrolled in single patient Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, evaluating subtherapeutic doses of 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively.\n\n**_Preliminary results_**\n\nData are available on two of three patients, with a cutoff date of October 7, 2024\n\n  * Preliminary results demonstrate that APR-1051 is safe and well-tolerated with no hematologic toxicity\n  * Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts were stable or increased slightly during the first treatment cycle\n  * There were no signs of neutropenia, with white blood cells and neutrophils trending up for both patients during the first treatment cycle\n  * All adverse events (AEs) recorded were Grade 1 and 2, with one Grade 1 AE (abdominal distention) possibly related to APR-1051\n  * No QT prolongation has been observed\n  * Three patients have been dosed to date with data available on two of these. One had disease progression at 49 days, a second withdrew following 36 days of treatment and dosing is ongoing in the third patient.\n\n\n\n“These preliminary data from our ongoing Phase 1 study are encouraging, showing that APR-1051 is safe and well-tolerated,” said Philippe Pultar, MD, Senior Medical Advisor and Lead of WEE1 Clinical Development at Aprea. “APR-1051 has been designed to be selective for WEE1, without the off-target inhibition of PLK or QT prolongation reported for other molecules in this class. We expect to confirm this favorable safety profile as we move to higher doses in the ACESOT-1051 trial. We are excited to explore the full therapeutic benefits of APR-1051, which has best in class potential, and hope to generate preliminary efficacy data from the study during 2025.”\n\nAPR-1051 targets WEE1 kinase, an enzyme involved in the DNA damage response pathway. Based on preclinical studies, Aprea believes that APR-1051 may solve liabilities associated with other WEE1 inhibitors and is differentiated based on: 1) molecular structure; 2) selectivity for WEE1 versus off-target inhibition of the polo-like kinase, or PLK, family of kinases; 3) potentially improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties; and 4) potential absence of QT prolongation at doses that significantly inhibit WEE1. No head-to-head studies with APR-1051 have been conducted.\n\nActive enrollment in ACESOT-1051 is ongoing at three sites in the U.S. (NEXT Oncology locations in San Antonio and Dallas, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center) with planned additional sites.\n\nAnthony Tolcher M.D., Founder of Next Oncology commented, “The preliminary findings from ACESOT-1051 are promising and we are encouraged by the minimal toxicity in the patients treated so far. WEE1 kinase is a validated oncology target and represents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention in patients who otherwise have poor prognosis and no effective treatments today. We look forward to further exploring APR-1051's potential and are excited to recruit additional patients as the study progresses.” \n\n**ACESOT-1051 Study Design**\n\nACESOT-1051 (**A** Multi-**C** enter **E** valuation of WEE1 Inhibitor in Patients with Advanced **So** lid **T** umors, APR-1051) is a focused biomarker-driven study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of single-agent APR-1051 in advanced solid tumors harboring cancer-associated gene alterations. Oral APR-1051 will be administered once daily for 28-day cycles. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 is dose escalation and is expected to enroll up to 39 patients with advanced solid tumors. The first three dose levels are using accelerated titration followed by Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design for the remaining dose levels; Part 2 (up to 40 patients) is designed for dose optimization, with the goal of selecting the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). For more information, refer to Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06260514.\n\nA copy of the poster will be available on Aprea’s corporate website today. Three additional posters will be available at the conclusion of the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Friday, October 25, 2024.\n\n**About Aprea**\n\nAprea Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, focused on precision oncology through synthetic lethality.
