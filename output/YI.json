This achievement is a testament to the strength of our business model as a one-stop shopping platform that offers the most comprehensive selection of pharmaceutical products at competitive prices. It also highlights our commitment to operational efficiency across the organization. As a result, income from operations in Q3 reached RMB2.4 million, a significant improvement from an operational loss of RMB80.4 million in the prior year.\"\n\nMr. Liu added, \"We gained greater operational efficiency through diligent cost management, ongoing infrastructure investments, and effective staffing arrangements, all of which has enabled us to navigate an unfavorable consumer spending environment while delivering solid performance results. Operating expenses were 5.8% of revenues, a reduction of 160 basis points compared to the previous year, while non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 100 basis points to 5.7%. We aim to lead the pharmaceutical e-commerce sector in efficiency and sharpen our competitive advantages. As we scale and optimize operations, we expect further cost savings, which will be reinvested into growth initiatives, including technological advancements, market expansion, and client base growth, driving future profitability.\"\n\n\"We are strengthening our core competitiveness in digitalization through advancements across multiple areas, laying a strong foundation for an agile, highly efficient, and customer-centric business that can swiftly adapt to evolving industry needs. Additionally, we've bolstered our supply chain with an expanded transshipment network and new fulfillment centers, further enhancing our service capabilities.\"\n\n\"Despite challenges, we are still confident in the long-term opportunities ahead. Our investments in AI and digital technologies are not only providing industry-leading efficiency and reshaping the healthcare value chain, but also positioning us to capture significant shifts in the pharmaceutical industry—particularly the unstoppable trend of digital transformation, the growing demand for out-of-hospital drug distribution, and the expansion of the silver economy. By deepening our partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, expanding our fulfillment network, refining our digital platforms, and prioritizing new growth engines, we are well-positioned to engage more industry stakeholders, meet the needs of a broad customer base, and generate sustained growth.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Net revenues** were RMB3.6 billion (US$513.1 million), representing a decrease of 1.8% from RMB3.7 billion in the same quarter of last year.\n\n(In thousands RMB) | For the three months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2024 | YoY  \n**B2B Net Revenue**  \nProduct | 3,556,749 | 3,514,298 | -1.2 %  \nService | 20,671 | 21,731 | 5.1 %  \nSub-Total | 3,577,420 | 3,536,029 | -1.2 %  \nCost of Products Sold(3) | 3,406,320 | 3,340,998 | -1.9 %  \n**Segment Profit** | 171,100 | 195,031 | 14.0 %  \n**Segment Profit %** | 4.8 % | 5.5 %  \n  \n(In thousands RMB) | For the three months ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2024 | YoY  \n**B2C Net Revenue**  \nProduct | 82,538 | 61,031 | -26.1 %  \nService | 5,287 | 3,615 | -31.6 %  \nSub-Total | 87,825 | 64,646 | -26.4 %  \nCost of Products Sold  | 68,301 | 49,061 | -28.2 %  \n**Segment Profit** | 19,524 | 15,585 | -20.2 %  \n**Segment Profit %** | 22.2 % | 24.1 %  \n  \n(3) For segment reporting purposes, purchase rebates are allocated to the B2B segment and B2C segments primarily based on the amount of cost of products sold for each segment.

The Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as income (loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax. The Company defines non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax. The Company defines non-GAAP loss per ADS as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax per ADS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that it includes in income (loss) from operations and net loss. Share-based compensation expenses is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. As a result, management excludes the items from its internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that the adjustments for share-based compensation expenses provide investors with a reasonable basis to measure the company's core operating performance, in a more meaningful comparison with the performance of other companies. The Company believes that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS provide useful information about its operating results, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the management in their financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, or non-GAAP loss per ADS is that it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

The discussion included key Current Price $0.75\ntakeaways from 111’s 2Q24 earnings report, expectations and\n52-Week Range $0.55-$2.68\nexpansion plans for the remainder of the year, and progress of\nthe rollout of 111’s digital innovations.

Liu does not expect the\nconsumption malaise to last long and sees the pharmacy sector\nPRICE PERFORMANCE\nas one of the best industries to participate in with central\ngovernment reforms encouraging a rapid expansion in retail\npharmacies across China. Indeed, Liu indicated that he would not\nbe surprised if the number of pharmacies in China exceeds\n700,000 by the end of 2024 from about 600,000 in 2023 and\n470,000 when 111 launched its B2B platform in 2017.\n• 111 continues to scale up. The company plans to build out its\nfulfillment center footprint by adding seven additional centers by the\nend of the year across various regions to the 11 established centers\nit operates. This, along with its work with thousands of distributors\nacross the country, is part of a strategy to significantly expand\nselections for its customers and provide a one-stop shopping\nexperience. 111’s business logic is to provide customers (i.e.,\npharmacies) with the richest selection of pharmaceutical products at\ncompetitive prices with the goal of creating customer loyalty.\n• Technology progress. Liu highlighted 111’s few dozen digital\noperating systems and adoption of AI for application in several\nareas of the company’s B2B platform that have contributed\nsignificantly toward its achievement of becoming the industry’s\nmost cost-efficient operator. Moreover, these are protected by an\nexpanding IP portfolio of 28 patents.\n• Focus on organic growth. Liu emphasized that 111’s strategy\nis focused on profitability and building on its core competencies.\nAs long as it keeps delivering sound financial results, it could be\nin a position to look into other opportunities.\n• Valuation enigma. We would point out that 111’s share price\nweakness through the summer ignores solid financial results and\nthe company’s financial health with its net cash & equivalents of\n$58 million (excluding restricted cash) based on today’s RMB/$\nexchange rate (7.01). This represents $0.68 per ADS, effectively\nvaluing a ~$2 billion business that has achieved operating\nprofitability in the last two quarters despite China’s economic\nheadwinds, at $0.04/ADS or $3.4 million as the time of writing.\n• Management’s faith in the business.

This achievement is a testament to the strength of our business model as a one-stop shopping platform that offers the most comprehensive selection of pharmaceutical products at competitive prices. It also highlights our commitment to operational efficiency across the organization. As a result, income from operations in Q3 reached RMB2.4 million, a significant improvement from an operational loss of RMB80.4 million in the prior year.\"\n\nMr. Liu added, \"We gained greater operational efficiency through diligent cost management, ongoing infrastructure investments, and effective staffing arrangements, all of which has enabled us to navigate an unfavorable consumer spending environment while delivering solid performance results. Operating expenses were 5.8% of revenues, a reduction of 160 basis points compared to the previous year, while non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 100 basis points to 5.7%. We aim to lead the pharmaceutical e-commerce sector in efficiency and sharpen our competitive advantages. As we scale and optimize operations, we expect further cost savings, which will be reinvested into growth initiatives, including technological advancements, market expansion, and client base growth, driving future profitability.\"\n\n\"We are strengthening our core competitiveness in digitalization through advancements across multiple areas, laying a strong foundation for an agile, highly efficient, and customer-centric business that can swiftly adapt to evolving industry needs. Additionally, we've bolstered our supply chain with an expanded transshipment network and new fulfillment centers, further enhancing our service capabilities.\"\n\n\"Despite challenges, we are still confident in the long-term opportunities ahead. Our investments in AI and digital technologies are not only providing industry-leading efficiency and reshaping the healthcare value chain, but also positioning us to capture significant shifts in the pharmaceutical industry—particularly the unstoppable trend of digital transformation, the growing demand for out-of-hospital drug distribution, and the expansion of the silver economy.

The Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as income (loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax. The Company defines non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax. The Company defines non-GAAP loss per ADS as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses, net of tax per ADS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that it includes in income (loss) from operations and net loss. Share-based compensation expenses is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. As a result, management excludes the items from its internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that the adjustments for share-based compensation expenses provide investors with a reasonable basis to measure the company's core operating performance, in a more meaningful comparison with the performance of other companies. The Company believes that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS provide useful information about its operating results, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the management in their financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, or non-GAAP loss per ADS is that it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nReconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
