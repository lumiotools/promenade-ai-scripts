IAnRvTeEsRto Fr IPSrCeAsLe n2t0a2t1io n\nENAoRvNemINbGeSr C20A2L4L MAY 20, 2021\nSafe Harbor Statement and Non-GAAP Measures\nCertain statements in this presentation, other than statements of historical fact, including estimates, projections, statements\nrelated to our business plans and operating results are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Monro has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such\nas “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “could,” “focus,” “will,” and the negative of these words or other comparable\nterminology. These forward-looking statements are based on Monro’s current expectations, estimates, projections and\nassumptions as of the date such statements are made, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these\nrisks and uncertainties are described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in\nthe “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections\nof our most recently filed periodic reports on Forms 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on Monro’s website at\nhttps://corporate.monro.com/investors/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx. Monro assumes no obligation to update or revise\nthese forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nIn addition to including references to diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), which is a generally accepted accounting\nprincipals (“GAAP”) measure, this presentation includes references to adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-\nGAAP financial measure. Monro has included a reconciliation from adjusted diluted EPS to its most directly comparable\nGAAP measure, diluted EPS in the appendix to this presentation. Management views this non-GAAP financial measure as\na way to better assess comparability between periods because management believes the non-GAAP financial measure\nshows the Company’s core business operations while excluding certain non-recurring items such as costs related to\nshareholder matters from the Company’s equity capital structure recapitalization, transition costs related to the Company’s\nback-office optimization, store impairment charges, net gain on sale of the Company’s corporate headquarters, and items\nrelated to store closings.\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to represent, and should not be considered more meaningful than, or as\nan alternative to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure. This non-GAAP financial measure may be different from\nsimilarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n2\nCompany Overview\nA Leading Chain of Independently Owned and Operated Tire and Auto Service Locations\nFiscal 2024 sales of $1,276.8 million\n1,272\ncompany operated\nstores in 32 states\n50\nfranchised locations\n10\nacquisitions in the past\n5 years adding\n156\nA Leading Chain in Expanding in Southern locations\nand\nthe Northeastern U.S. and Western markets\n$224M\nin revenue\nand entry into\n3 new states\nMap as of 9/28/24 3\nInvestment Thesis\nLeading national\nFocus on operational Scalable platform with Driving Monro forward\nautomotive service and tire\nexcellence to increase significant growth sustainably\nprovider with 1,272\ncustomer lifetime value opportunity in acquisitions\nlocations in 32 states\nWell-positioned to Delivering consistent\nLow-cost operator with Strong balance sheet and\ncapitalize on a favorable shareholder returns\nsolid operating margins operating cash flow\nindustry backdrop through dividends\n4\nFundamentals of Industry Remain Strong\nFavorable Industry Backdrop for Automotive Services\nU.S. Annual Light Vehicle Sales U.S. Light Vehicles in Operation (VIO)\n290,000\n20\n18\n280,000\n16\n14 270,000\n12\n10 260,000\n8\n250,000\n6\n4\n240,000\n2\n0 230,000\n06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nSource: FRED Economic Data, Light weight Vehicle Sales: Autos and Light Trucks (annual data) Source: Auto Care Association Factbook\nAnnual Vehicles Miles Traveled Key Highlights\n3,300,000\n▪ An overall growing trend in total vehicle population\n3,225,000\nrelated to consumers owning vehicles longer\n3,150,000\n▪ 280+ million vehicles on the road\n3,075,000\n▪ Increasing age of vehicles (average of ~12 years)\n3,000,000\n2,925,000 ▪ Increasing complexity of vehicles\n2,850,000 ▪ Vehicle miles traveled recovering from 2020 lows\n2,775,000\n2,700,000\n06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nSource: Office of Highway Policy Information Traffic Volume Trends Data, Moving 12-Month Total Vehicle Miles Traveled 5\nFundamentals of Industry Remain Strong\nMonro Operates in the $333 Billion Do-It-For-Me* Segment of $414 Billion U.S. Automotive Aftermarket Industry\nAutomotive Aftermarket DIFM vs. DIY Sales\n% %\n2019 2023 CAGR\n(outlets) (outlets)\n450,000\nMotor Vehicle Dealers 16,741 14.3% 16,835 13.8% 0.1%\n400,000\n350,000 General Repair Garages 81,537 69.8% 86,614 71.1% 1.5%\n300,000\n250,000\nSpecialty Repair 11,304 9.7% 10,570 8.7% (1.7%)\n200,000\n150,000\nOil Change/Lube 7,284 6.2% 7,865 6.4% 1.9%\n100,000\n50,000\nTotal 116,866 100.0% 121,884 100.0%\n0\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nSource: Auto Care Association Factbook\nDIFM DIY Note: The table above is not intended to be a complete list of competitors within the automotive aftermarket, which also\nSource: Auto Care Association Factbook Estimates for 2019-2023;
