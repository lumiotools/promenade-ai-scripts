All Corporation officers and directors should be familiar with the requirements of the\nCode and should encourage colleagues to apply the Code to their daily activities and decisions, and to seek\nguidance from the appropriate individuals when additional information or explanation is needed.\nCopies of the Code may be obtained from several sources, including the Corporation’s website, your immediate\nsupervisor or any management official.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, continued Classification: Public Page 1 of 9\n1 34290860v2\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1C91391E-0B6C-4306-8432-AE0E59189FAD\n3.0 References\nIf you need additional explanation regarding a particular provision of the Code, or if you need guidance in a\nspecific situation, including whether a conflict or potential conflict of interest may exist, please contact your\nimmediate supervisor. If you are uncomfortable speaking to your immediate supervisor, or if you require\nadditional guidance after having consulted with your supervisor, you are encouraged to contact one of the\nfollowing individuals:\nChief Financial Officer SVP, Human Resources\n2174 Eastridge Center 2174 Eastridge Center\nEau Claire, Wisconsin 54701 Eau Claire, Wisconsin 54701\nOffice: (715) 836-9994 ext. 11019 Office:(715) 836-9994 ext.11042\nE-mail: jbroucek@ccf.us E-mail: abell@ccf.us\n4.0 Policy Statements\nOne of the most valued assets of the Corporation is its reputation for integrity as determined by the personal\nconduct of its directors, officers, and colleagues, and how that conduct may be perceived by the public. The\nethical management of both personal and business affairs is most important to all directors, officers, and\ncolleagues in order to avoid situations that might lead to a conflict, or even appearance of a conflict, between\npersonal interest and responsibility to the Corporation. Your position should never be used directly or indirectly\nfor private gain, for advancement of personal interests, or to obtain favors or benefits for oneself, family\nmembers, friends, customers, or suppliers.\nNothing in this policy is intended to prevent you, a colleague of CCFBank, from exercising your rights under\nthe National Labor Relations Act to engage in “concerted activity.” You have the right to act with co-workers\nto address work-related issues. An example would be talking with one or more co-workers about your wages\nand benefits or other working conditions, However, you can lose protection by saying or doing something\negregiously offensive or knowingly and maliciously false, or by publicly disparaging CCFBank’s products or\nservices without relating your complaints to any labor controversy. If you believe any rule in this policy is in\nviolation of your right to engage in concerted activity, or if any member of management has indicated you do\nnot have such rights, you must immediately contact the VP of Human Resources.\nThe following is a statement of policy regarding standards of conduct expected from directors, officers, and\ncolleagues of the Corporation.\n4.1 Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s private interest (or the interest of a member of their\nfamily) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Corporation as a whole. A conflict\nof interest can arise when a director, officer, or colleague (or a member of their family) takes actions or\nhas interests that may make it difficult to perform their work for the Corporation objectively and effectively.\nConflicts of interest also arise when a director, officer, or colleague (or a member of their family) receives\nimproper personal benefits as a result of their position in the Corporation.\nWhether or not a conflict of interest exists or will exist can be unclear. Persons other than directors and\nexecutive officers who have questions about a potential conflict of interest or who become aware of an\nactual or potential conflict should discuss the matter with and seek a determination and prior authorization\nor approval from, their supervisor, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Vice President of Human Resources.\nNo person may authorize or approve conflict of interest matters or make determinations as to whether a\nproblematic conflict of interest exists without first providing the Chief Executive Officer with a written\ndescription of the activity and seeking the Chief Executive Officer’s written approval. If the supervisor is\ninvolved in the potential or actual conflict, the matter should instead be discussed directly with the Chief\nExecutive Officer.\nDirectors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior authorizations or approvals of\npotential conflicts of interest exclusively from the Audit Committee.\n4.2 Confidential and Insider Information\nConfidentiality is a fundamental principle of the financial services business. In the course of performing\nyour duties, you may develop or acquire confidential information. Confidential information includes all\nnon-public information that provides advantage to the Corporation, might be of use to competitors, or if\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, continued Classification: Public Page 2 of 9\n1 34290860v2\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1C91391E-0B6C-4306-8432-AE0E59189FAD\nimproperly disclosed might be harmful to the Corporation or its customers. Confidential information, in\nany form, obtained through business or personal contacts with customers, prospective customers,\nsuppliers, or other colleagues shall be used solely for the Corporation’s purposes. Information reflecting\nfavorably or adversely upon the current or future value of any business enterprise should not be used in\nany manner for personal gain or for advantage to a third party. This confidential information must not be\nused for one’s own purposes or gain, revealed to unauthorized persons or discussed with others within\nthe Corporation unless their job duties require this information. The use of confidential information\nsubmitted to us through any source about one customer to further the private interests of another\ncustomer is unethical and may be illegal.\nSome specific examples of confidential information include:\n The identity of customers and potential customers and their personal, business, account\nand financial information;\n Non-public business and financial information of the Corporation;\n Personal information regarding any colleague of the Corporation;\n Personal or non-public business information regarding any supplier, vendor or agent of the\nCorporation;\n Information related to, including the identity of, potential candidates for mergers and\nacquisitions;\n Information regarding the Corporation’s sales or marketing strategies, plans or proposals;\n Information related to computer software programs, whether proprietary or standard;\n Information related to documentation systems, information databases, customized hardware\nor other information systems and technological developments;\n Manuals, processes, policies, procedures, compositions, opinion letters, ideas, innovations,\ninventions, formulas and other proprietary information belonging to the Corporation or\nrelated to the Corporation’s activities;\n Security information, including without limitation, policies and procedures, passwords,\npersonal identification numbers (PINs) and electronic access keys;\n Communications by, to and from regulatory agencies; and,\n Certain communications with or from attorneys for the Corporation, whether internal or\nexternal.\nThis protection regarding confidential information does not preclude releasing certain customer\ninformation when authorized by the customer or to the government when appropriate. Disclosure of\nconfidential information to attorneys, accountants and other professionals working on behalf of the\nCorporation, as well as regulatory examiners, may also be appropriate.\n4.3 Insider Trading Policy\nThe federal securities laws prohibit any director, officer or colleague of the Corporation from purchasing\nor selling company securities on the basis of material nonpublic information concerning the Corporation\nor from disclosing material nonpublic information concerning the Corporation or third parties, or from\ndisclosing material nonpublic information to others who might trade on the bases of that information. Refer\nto the Corporation’s Insider Trading Policy for additional information.\n4.4 Gifts and Fees\nIt is illegal for anyone to offer or promise anything of value to a colleague, officer, director, or agent of a\nfinancial institution with the intent to influence or reward the person in connection with any business or\ntransaction of the financial institution. It is also illegal for any colleague, officer, director or agent of a\nfinancial institution to solicit or accept anything of value from any person intending to be influenced or\nrewarded in connection with any business or transaction of the financial institution.\nNo director, officer or colleague of the Corporation shall accept anything of value from a customer of the\nCorporation or a vendor to the Corporation other than the following:\n1. Gifts based on a family relationship or gifts of a reasonable value based on a personal\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, continued Classification: Public Page 3 of 9\n1 34290860v2\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1C91391E-0B6C-4306-8432-AE0E59189FAD\nrelationship where that relationship is the obvious motivating factor for the gift;\n2. Advertising or promotional material with a value of less than $100;\n3. Gifts with a value of less than $25 related to commonly recognized events such as a\npromotion, religious holiday, wedding, or retirement;\n4. Acceptance of customary hospitality (business luncheons, dinners, golf outings, ball\ngames, etc.) where it is directly related to Corporation activities and provided that the\nexpense would be paid for by the Corporation if not paid for by another party. Any\nentertainment beyond that scope or of a frequent nature (more than twice a year by the\nsame party) must be pre-authorized by the Chief Executive Officer;\n5. Discounts or rebates on merchandise or services that do not exceed those available to\nother customers of the merchant; or\n6. Awards for recognition of service or accomplishment from civic, charitable, educational or\nreligious organizations.\nIf a director, officer or colleague receives or anticipates receiving a benefit from a Corporate customer or\nvendor and is unsure whether acceptance of the gift is in compliance with this policy, a written disclosure\nshould be made to the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors may approve the acceptance of\nthe benefit if the acceptance is otherwise consistent with this policy.\nDirectors, officers, colleagues, and their immediate families should never borrow personally from\ncustomers or suppliers unless these entities are engaged directly in the lending business, and then only\nunder normal conditions with respect to interest rates, terms, security, and repayment programs that are\navailable to any borrower.\n4.5 Payments to Government Personnel\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials\nof foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business. It is strictly\nprohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities\nwhich may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise offer or delivery to an official or\ncolleague of the U.S. government of a gift, favor, or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only\nviolate Corporation policy but could also be a criminal offense. State and local governments, as well as\nforeign governments, may have similar rules.\n4.6 Outside Activities\nOutside activities that might constitute a conflict of interest or interfere with performance, or compromise\na director’s, officer’s, or colleague’s position, are to be avoided. Colleague activities such as full-time\noutside employment; the rendering of investment, legal or accounting services; membership on corporate\nboards of directors; seeking of an elective political position; or appointment to government bodies should\nbe reviewed and approved by the Chief Executive Officer prior to such undertakings. As in the past, we\ncontinue to encourage active participation on the part of directors, officers and colleagues in service clubs\nand organizations fostering the betterment of the community, and the active use of various social\nmemberships in maintaining a proper image of our organization within the community.\n4.7 Protection and Proper Use of Corporation Assets\nAll directors, officers and colleagues should protect the Corporation’s assets and ensure their efficient\nuse. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Corporation’s profitability and are\nprohibited. All Corporation assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes, though incidental\npersonal use may be permitted. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be reported for\ninvestigation immediately.\nThe obligation to protect Corporation assets includes the Corporation’s confidential or proprietary\ninformation. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents,\ntrademarks, and copyrights, as well as business and marketing plans, engineering and manufacturing\nideas, designs, databases, records and any non-public financial data or reports. Unauthorized use or\ndistribution of this information is prohibited and could also be illegal and result in civil or criminal penalties.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, continued Classification: Public Page 4 of 9\n1 34290860v2\nDocusign Envelope ID: 1C91391E-0B6C-4306-8432-AE0E59189FAD\n4.8 Corporate Opportunities\nAll directors, officers and colleagues owe a duty to the Corporation to advance its interests when the\nopportunity arises. Directors, officers, and colleagues are prohibited from taking for themselves personally\n(or for the benefit of friends or family members) opportunities that are discovered through the use of\nCorporation assets, property, information or position. Directors, officers, and colleagues may not use\nCorporation assets, property, information, or position for personal gain (including gain of friends or family\nmembers). In addition, no director, officer, or colleague may compete with the Corporation.\n4.9 Fair Dealing\nEach director, officer and colleague must deal fairly with the Corporation’s customers, suppliers, partners,\nservice providers, competitors, colleagues, and anyone else with whom they have had contact while\nperforming their job. No director, officer or colleague may take unfair advantage of anyone through\nmanipulation, concealment, abuse or privileged information, misrepresentation of facts or any other unfair\ndealing practice.\n4.10 Fiduciary Appointments and Beneficiary or Legacy under a Will or Trust\nNo colleague or member of an colleague’s family may act in any fiduciary capacity under a will, trust or\nother instrument of a customer of the Corporation unless prior approval has been obtained from the Chief\nExecutive Officer and after consultation with legal counsel and the colleague turns over to the Corporation\nany commission or fees received. This does not apply to a will, trust or other instrument established by a\nmember of the colleague’s family.\nIn all estate or trust matters involving colleagues where the Corporation is a fiduciary, the Chief Executive\nOfficer must be consulted in advance in order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nAny colleague may never demand, request or solicit any benefit under a will or trust instrument of a\ncustomer of the Corporation. Colleagues must report to their supervisor, the Chief Financial Officer, or the\nVice President of Human Resources any gift of a beneficial interest or legacy under wills or trusts of\ncustomers of the Corporation, unless the customer is a member of the colleague’s family.\nIn all above situations ‘family’ means parent, spouses, children, or siblings.\n4.11 Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nAll directors, officers and colleagues of the Corporation are required to comply with the requirements of\nthis Code, all policies of the Corporation and applicable laws, rules and regulations. Directors, officers\nand colleagues must also comply with the procedures implementing and effectuating the Corporation’s\npolicies. Failure to comply with the Corporation’s policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action\nincluding, in severe situations, immediate termination of employment.\n4.12 Disclosure and Accounting Practices\nThe Corporation’s periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC, including all financial\nstatements and other financial information, must comply with applicable federal securities laws and SEC\nrules. The Corporation’s policies are intended to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable\ndisclosure in reports and documents filed with or submitted to the SEC and in the Corporation’s public\nstatements.\nEach director, officer and colleague who contributes in any way to the preparation or verification of the\nCorporation’s financial statements and other financial information must ensure that the Corporation’s\nbooks, records and accounts are accurately maintained and fairly reflect in reasonable detail the financial\ncondition and results of operations of the Corporation, including observing and complying with generally\naccepted accounting principles and the system of disclosure controls and procedures and its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting established by the Corporation.

          "content": "Corporate Governance Guidelines\nIntroduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), acting on\nthe recommendation of its Governance and Nomination Committee, has developed and adopted a set\nof corporate governance principles (the “Guidelines”) establishing a common set of expectations to\nassist the Board and the board of its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Citizens Community Federal\nN.A. (the “Bank Board”), and the committees of such Boards in performing their duties in compliance\nwith applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nThese Guidelines should be considered in the context of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as\namended (the “Articles of Incorporation”), Bylaws (“Bylaws”), Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n(“Code”), the charters of committees of the Board and Bank Board, and its other applicable policies.\nThe Company will publish these Guidelines, the Code, and its Board committee charters as directed\nby SEC and NASDAQ rules on its website and will make paper copies available upon request.\nBoard Size and Composition\nSize. The size of the Board should facilitate substantive discussions of the whole Board in which each\ndirector can participate meaningfully. Pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company, the Board shall\ndesignate the number of directors from time to time, except that in the absence of such designation,\nsuch number shall be eight. The Governance and Nomination Committee will assess the size of the\nBoard periodically to determine whether its size continues to be appropriate and make\nrecommendations to the Board as necessary.\nIndependence. A majority of the Board shall consist of directors who satisfy the definition of\n“independent” under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”). Directors\nserving on certain Board committees may also be subject to additional independence standards as\nspecified in SEC or NASDAQ rules or the relevant committee charters.\nReview of Independence. The Board shall review at least annually the independence of the\ndirectors, including the relationship that any director has with the Company (either directly or as a\npartner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). Only\nthose directors whom the Board affirmatively determines have no material relationship with the\nCompany should be considered “independent,” subject to additional qualifications prescribed under\nthe rules of NASDAQ. The basis for the Board’s determination that a relationship between a director\nand the Company is not material shall be disclosed in the Company’s annual proxy statement. Each\nindependent director shall notify the chairman of the Governance and Nomination Committee, as\nsoon as practicable, in the event that his or her circumstances change in a manner that may affect\nthe Board’s evaluation of his or her independence.\nA director will not fail to be deemed “independent” solely as a result of a credit relationship between\nthe Company and a company with which the director is affiliated by reason of being an executive\nofficer or a significant shareholder thereof; provided: (1) that such credit relationship was originated\nand is currently maintained (a) in the ordinary course of business, and (b) on substantially the same\nterms (including interest rate and collateral) as those for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated\npersons; (2) credit underwriting procedures were followed that are not less stringent than those for\ncomparable transactions with other nonaffiliated persons; and (3) the credit relationship did not at\ntime of origination and does not currently involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present\nother unfavorable features.\nSelection of Directors\nNomination. The Governance and Nomination Committee shall recommend to the Board a slate of\ndirectors for the class of directors to be elected at each annual meeting of the Company’s\nstockholders, and one or more individuals to fill vacancies on the Board occurring between annual\nmeetings of the stockholders. Stockholders also have the opportunity to nominate directors for\nelection at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the nomination\nprocedures set forth in the Company’s Bylaws.\nSelection Criteria.\nService as a director is based on the needs and best interests of the Company. The Governance and\nNomination Committee is expected to reassess a director’s performance and consider alignment of\nexperience and other qualities with the needs of the Company for every re-nomination decision.\nCore Competencies\nWhen nominating candidates to the Board, the Governance and Nomination Committee may\nconsider, among other things, business experience, education, integrity and reputation,\nindependence, conflicts of interest, diversity, age, number of other directorships and commitments\n(including charitable obligations), tenure on the Board, attendance at Board and committee meetings,\nstock ownership, and a commitment to the Company’s communities and shared values, as well as\noverall experience in the context of the needs of the Board as a whole. In addition, the Governance\nand Nomination Committee may consider certain core competencies and specialized knowledge,\nsuch as an understanding of banking, accounting, marketing, finance, risk management, strategy\ndevelopment, M&A and capital raising, regulation and public policy. The Governance and Nomination\nCommittee maintains, periodically reviews and updates a Board skills matrix that includes the\nforgoing and other core competencies deemed relevant from time to time and uses it as input in\ncontinuous improvement efforts.\nDiversity\nWhen nominating candidates to the Board, the Governance and Nomination Committee may\nconsider, among other things, certain self-identified diversity characteristics, including race, gender,\nethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or cultural background, when determining\nan individual’s specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills for membership on the Board.\nGovernance and Nomination Committee Review Process\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee shall review these criteria and recommend any changes\nto the Board. Each candidate will be evaluated by the Governance and Nomination Committee in the\ncontext of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group of nominees that can\nbest perpetuate the success of the Company. The Governance and Nomination Committee may use\na variety of means to identify nominees, including, among other things, recommendations from\nstockholders, current directors and management. It is the policy of the Governance and Nomination\nCommittee that it will consider a director candidate, if qualified to serve on the Board, who is\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 2\n74624262v4\nrecommended by a stockholder, and to use the same standards to evaluate nominees whether they\nare proposed by members of the Board, the Company’s management or stockholders.\nElection. Directors shall be elected in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and\nBylaws.\nOrientation and Continuing Education. Management, working with the Chairman and, if\napplicable, the Lead Director, shall provide an orientation process for new directors, which shall\ninclude: background material on the Company, its business plan and risk profile, including significant\nfinancial, accounting and risk management information and meetings with executive officers.\nPeriodically, management and the Governance and Nomination Committee shall prepare additional\neducational sessions during Board meetings for directors on matters relevant to the Company, its\nbusiness plan, risk profile and compliance programs. Directors are encouraged to attend, at the\nCompany’s expense, continuing education programs sponsored by educational and other institutions.\nTerm\nDirectors shall hold office for staggered three-year terms, and until his or her successor shall have\nbeen duly elected and qualified, as provided in the Articles of Incorporation. The Governance and\nNomination Committee shall consider each director’s continuation on the Board at the expiration of\nhis or her term and before that director is considered for reelection, taking into account the\nperformance and contribution of that director. In addition, those individual directors who change their\nprincipal occupation, position, or responsibility they held when they were elected to the Board should\nsubmit their resignation from the Board. It is not the sense of the Board that in every instance the\ndirectors who retire or change from the position they held when they joined the Board should\nnecessarily leave the Board. There should, however, be an opportunity for the Board, through the\nGovernance and Nomination Committee, to review the continued appropriateness of Board\nmembership under the circumstances.\nDirectors shall advise the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Governance and\nNomination Committee in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on another public company\nboard. There should be an opportunity for the Board, through the Governance and Nomination\nCommittee, to review the director’s availability to fulfill his or her responsibilities as a director if he or\nshe serves on more than three other public company boards.\nThe Board does not believe it should establish term limits. The Board recognizes that a mix of tenures\non the Board is beneficial. While term limits could help ensure that there are fresh ideas and\nviewpoints available to the Board, they have the disadvantage of losing the contribution of directors\nwho have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company and its\noperation and, therefore, provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. The retirement\nof a director should normally occur at the end of the term in which he or she becomes 79 years of\nage.\nLeadership Structure\nThe Board does not have a fixed policy regarding the separation of the offices of the Chairman and\nthe Chief Executive Officer and believes it should maintain the flexibility to establish a leadership\nstructure that fits the needs of the Company and its stockholders at any particular point in time. The\nBoard of Directors regularly evaluates the Board’s leadership structure to ensure it continues to be in\nthe best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Board is currently led by a Chairman\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 3\n74624262v4\nselected by the Board. The Board believes there are a number of important advantages at this time\nto combine the offices of the Chairman and the CEO. The CEO is the director most familiar with the\nCompany’s business, industry, and markets. As such, he or she is best situated to lead Board\ndiscussions on important matters affecting the Company. Combining the offices of the Chairman and\nthe CEO provides unified leadership for the Company, promotes the development and\nimplementation of corporate strategy, and contributes to a more efficient and effective board.\nPresently, Stephen M. Bianchi, the Company’s CEO, is also Chairman of the Board. Mr. Bianchi has\nworked in the banking industry for more than 36 years, has the experience and expertise necessary\nto understand the opportunities and challenges facing the Company, the ability to develop and\nmaintain key business and investor relationships, and he possesses the requisite leadership and\nmanagement skills to promote and execute the Company’s values and strategy.\nThe Board recognizes the importance of strong independent leadership and is aware of the potential\nconflicts that may arise when a member of management chairs the Board. The Board believes,\nhowever, that these potential conflicts are mitigated and offset by existing safeguards, which include\nmaintaining a majority of independent directors, the designation of a lead independent director,\nregular meetings of the independent directors in executive session without the presence of\nmanagement, the fact that management compensation is determined by a committee of independent\ndirectors who make extensive use of peer benchmarking, and the fact that much of the Company’s\noperations are highly regulated.\nWhen the positions of Chairman and CEO are held by the same person, the Board recognizes that a\nlead independent director selected by the other independent directors (the “Lead Director”) can\nfacilitate the processes and controls that support a strong and independent Board and strengthen the\ncohesiveness and effectiveness of the Board as a whole. In such case, the independent directors will\nselect bi-annually a Lead Director immediately following the Company’s annual meeting of\nstockholders.\nThe Lead Director shall be an “independent director” within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Lead Director will serve a two-year term. In\nthe event of a vacancy in the Lead Director role during his or her term, the independent directors will\nselect another independent director who will serve as the Lead Director until the Company’s next\nannual meeting of stockholders. The Lead Director may be removed from the position of Lead\nDirector at any time, with or without cause, by a majority vote of the independent directors. The\nidentity of the Lead Director will be set forth in the Company’s annual proxy statement.\nThe responsibilities and duties of the Lead Director will consist of the following:\n1. Preside at meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including the\nexecutive sessions of the independent members of the Board, and provide feedback\nto the Chairman and other senior executives, as appropriate, from such executive\nsessions of the independent directors.\n2. Serve as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman\non Board issues, and facilitate timely communication between the CEO and the\nBoard, without impeding or replacing direct communication between the Chairman\nand other directors.\n3. Collaborate with the Chairman to approve the schedules and agendas for meetings\nof the Board.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 4\n74624262v4\n4. Call meetings of the independent directors of the Company and set the agendas for\nsuch meetings; and brief the Chairman on issues arising out of such meetings.\n5. Recommend to the Governance and Nomination Committee selections for the\nmembership and chairman positions for each Board committee.\n6. Respond directly to stockholder and other stakeholder questions and comments that\nare directed to the Lead Director or the independent directors as a group.\n7. Be authorized to communicate directly with and retain outside advisors and\nconsultants to the Board regarding Board-wide issues.\n8. As requested by the Chairman of the Governance and Nomination Committee,\nparticipate in interviews for nominees to the Board.\n9. Provide his or her unique perspective, as Lead Director, in connection with the\nannual formal evaluation by the Compensation Committee of the CEO’s\nperformance.\n10. Receive notice of all committee meetings and have the ability to attend and observe\n(in an ex officio capacity) from time to time committee meetings where appropriate to\nfacilitate the execution of the Lead Director’s duties.\n11. Perform such other duties as the Board may from time to time delegate to the Lead\nDirector.\nBoard Meetings\nNumber. The Board generally holds not less than four (4) meetings each year, with additional\nmeetings (or action to be taken by written consent) at the discretion of the Chairman. The meetings\nusually will be comprised of committee meetings, the Board meeting, a meeting of the Bank Board\nand an executive session of the non-management directors.\nAgenda and Materials. The Chairman shall prepare and, if applicable, obtain the approval of the\nLead Director for the agenda for each Board meeting. The Chairman will direct management to\nprovide to all directors an agenda and appropriate materials in advance of meetings, to the extent\npossible.\nCommittees of the Board\nExecutive Sessions. NASDAQ rules require that the independent Board members regularly meet in\nexecutive session without the presence of directors who are at such time not “independent” as\ndetermined in these guidelines. The Board’s policy is to hold these executive sessions without the\npresence of management, including the chief executive officer and any other non-independent\ndirectors in connection with each regularly scheduled Board meeting, and at other times as\nnecessary.\nCommittees. The Board shall have at least the committees required by the rules of NASDAQ, as well\nas such other committees as the Board deems advisable. NASDAQ currently requires listed\ncompanies to have the following committees: (i) an audit committee; (ii) a compensation committee;\nand (iii) a nominating/corporate governance committee. Each of these three committees shall have a\nwritten charter satisfying the rules of NASDAQ. The Board currently has five standing committees of\nthe Board and the Bank Board: (i) Audit Committee; (ii) Compensation Committee; (iii) Governance\nand Nomination Committee; (iv) Risk Oversight Committee; and (v) Credit Committee. The Board\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 5\n74624262v4\nalso may establish other committees or disband existing ones, as it deems appropriate, consistent\nwith applicable laws, regulations and corporate charters. Each committee shall have the authority and\nresponsibilities delineated in its charter and the resolutions creating it.\nComposition of Committees. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the\nGovernance and Nomination Committee shall be comprised entirely of directors who are, in the\nbusiness judgment of the Board, “independent” under the rules of NASDAQ, including any additional\nindependence requirements for members of a committee. Committee members are appointed by the\nBoard upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nomination Committee. A director may\nserve on more than one committee for which he or she qualifies. The Governance and Nomination\nCommittee will consider on a periodic basis whether it is in the Company’s best interest to rotate\nchairs and/or members within and among committees.\nDuties of Committee Chair. The committee chair, in consultation with the Chairman, management\nand other committee members, develops the committee’s agenda. The committee chair, in\nconsultation with the Chairman and, as applicable, the Lead Director, determines whether special\ncommittee meetings or longer meetings are advisable. The committee chair reports on a committee’s\nmeeting at the full Board meeting following the committee meeting.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board believes directors and the named executive officers as designated in its annual meeting\nproxy statement (the “Named Executive Officers”) should own a meaningful amount of the Company’s\ncommon stock. The Company’s Named Executive Officers as of the date of adoption of these\nGuidelines are the persons holding the titles of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Board’s stock ownership guidelines for directors of the Company are that (i) within one year of\nbeing elected, directors should own Company common stock equal in value to at least a director’s\ncurrent yearly base compensation for service on the Board, (ii) within three years of being elected\ndirectors should own Company common stock equal in value to at least 2.5 times a director’s then\ncurrent yearly base compensation for service on the Board, and (iii) within five years of being elected\ndirectors should own Company common stock equal in value to at least 5 times a director’s then\ncurrent yearly base compensation for service on the Board.\nThe Board’s stock ownership guidelines for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company are that (i)\nwithin one year of being appointed, the Chief Executive Officer should own Company common stock\nequal in value to at least the Chief Executive Officer’s current yearly base compensation for\nemployment with the Company, (ii) within two and one half years of being appointed, the Chief\nExecutive Officer should own Company common stock equal in value to at least 2 times the Chief\nExecutive Officer’s then current yearly base compensation for employment with the Company, and\n(iii) within five years of being appointed, the Chief Executive Officer should own Company common\nstock equal in value to at least 3 times the Chief Executive Officer’s then current yearly base\ncompensation for employment with the Company.\nThe Board’s stock ownership guidelines for Named Executive Officers of the Company other than the\nChief Executive Officer are that (i) within one year of being appointed, such Named Executive\nOfficers should own Company common stock equal in value to at least the applicable officer’s current\nyearly base compensation for employment with the Company, (ii) within two and one half years of\nbeing appointed, such Named Executive Officers should own Company common stock equal in value\nto at least 1.5 times the applicable officer’s then current yearly base compensation for employment\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 6\n74624262v4\nwith the Company, and (iii) within five years of being appointed, such Named Executive Officers\nshould own Company common stock equal in value to at least 2 times the applicable officer’s then\ncurrent yearly base compensation for employment with the Company.\nThese share ownership guidelines are calculated using the current yearly base compensation for\nservice on the Board or employment by the Company. Shares that count towards satisfaction of these\nguidelines include (i) shares owned outright by the director and executive officer or his or her\nimmediate family members residing in the same household and (ii) shares held in trust for the benefit\nof the director and executive officer or his or her family. Shares that do not count toward these\nownership guidelines include unexercised stock options and shares of restricted stock for which\nrestrictions have not yet lapsed. After satisfying the minimum share ownership requirements, a\ndirector or executive officer shall be required to continue to maintain and hold that amount of share\nownership until he or she leaves the Board or, in the case of an executive officer, until he or she is no\nlonger serving or employed in such a role at the Company. These guidelines may be waived, at the\ndiscretion of the Board, if compliance would create severe hardship.\nManagement Succession\nAs part of its role in directing the management of the business and affairs of the Company, the Board\nis responsible for selecting, evaluating, and compensating the Chief Executive Officer and for\noverseeing the Company’s succession planning activities.\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for annually facilitating the performance evaluation of\nthe CEO. The Compensation Committee will engage the Board during the evaluation process and\nprovide a formal report to the Board regarding its performance assessment.\nThe Board’s responsibility is to ensure that the Company’s management has the capabilities to\nenable the Company to operate in an efficient and businesslike fashion in the event of a vacancy in\nsenior management, either anticipated or sudden. The Committee shall conduct management\nsuccession planning reviews and report the results of such reviews to the Board.\nExecutive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee shall oversee the Company’s executive compensation. It annually\nevaluates the performance of the CEO, including accomplishment of goals and overall performance\nof the Company. The Compensation Committee shall recommend to the Board the compensation\nlevel and structure of the CEO and other executive officers.\nBoard Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee shall annually review and make recommendations to the Board\nregarding the components and amount of Board compensation in relation to other similarly situated\ncompanies. Directors (other than those who are also salaried officers of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries) shall receive reasonable compensation for their services as members of the Board and\nany committees on which they may serve, as may be determined from time to time by the Board upon\nrecommendation of the Compensation Committee, as well as reimbursement of expenses. The\nBoard shall consider what is customary in the market when reviewing Board compensation, both with\nrespect to the amount and form of compensation to be paid and shall exercise due care to assure that\ntheir objectivity is not called into question as a result of the form or amount of compensation.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, continued Classification: Internal Page 7\n74624262v4\nExpectations of Directors\nThe business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board in\naccordance with Maryland law. In performing their duties, the primary responsibility of the directors\nshall be to exercise their business judgment in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders.\nCommitment and Attendance. All directors are expected to make every effort to attend every\nmeeting of the Board, the committees on which they serve, and the annual meetings of the\nstockholders. Any director who is unable to attend a meeting is expected to notify the Chairman or\nthe chairman of the appropriate committee in advance of such meeting.\nParticipation in Meetings. Each director is expected to be sufficiently familiar with the business of\nthe Company, including its financial statements and capital structure, and the risks and competition it\nfaces, to facilitate active and effective participation in the deliberations of the Board and of each\ncommittee on which he or she serves. Upon request, management will make appropriate personnel\navailable to answer any questions a director may have about any aspect of the Company’s business.\nDirectors also are expected to review the materials provided by management and advisors in\nadvance of the meetings of the Board and its committees and should arrive prepared to discuss the\nissues presented in such materials.\nLoyalty and Ethics. In their roles as directors, all directors perform their duties in what they\nreasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company. The Company has adopted the Code,\nas well as an Insider Trading Policy. Certain portions of these documents address activities of\ndirectors, particularly with respect to transactions in the securities of the Company, potential conflicts\nof interest, the taking of corporate opportunities for personal use, competing with the Company,\nconfidentiality and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Directors are expected to\nbe familiar with the provisions of the Code and the Insider Trading Policy. Any waivers of the Code\nfor directors or executive officers may be made only by the Board and must be promptly disclosed to\nthe stockholders.\nContact with Management. All directors are invited to contact the CEO at any time to discuss any\naspect of the Company’s business. The CEO will also facilitate director access to other members of\nmanagement (while ensuring that such contact does not interfere with the operation of the Company’s\nordinary business).\nIndependent Advisors. The Board and its committees have the right at any time to consult with and\nretain independent legal, financial, or other advisors.\nConfidentiality. The proceedings and deliberations of the Board and its committees are confidential.\nEach director shall maintain the confidentiality of information received in connection with his or her\nservice as a director.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, a written waiver of notice, signed\nby the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent\nto notice.
