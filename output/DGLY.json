The Special\nMeeting will be held at our corporate facility, located at 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas, 66215. The telephone number at that location is (913) 814-\n7774.\nVoting materials, which include this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card, will be first mailed to stockholders on or about July 26, 2024.\nStanton E. Ross is named as attorney-in-fact in the proxy. Mr. Ross is our Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Ross will vote all\nshares represented by properly executed proxies returned in time to be counted at the Special Meeting, as described below. Where a vote has been specified\nin the proxy with respect to the matters identified in the Notice of the Special Meeting, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted in accordance with\nthose voting specifications. If no voting instructions are indicated, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors on all matters, and\nas the proxy holder may determine in his discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote before the Special Meeting.\nThe stockholders will consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement, entered into as\nof June 24, 2024, by and between the Company and investors, including, the issuance of 20% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, par\nvalue $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) upon (i) exercise of Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrant; and (ii) exercise of Series B Common Stock\nPurchase Warrant, each dated June 25, 2024.\nWho is Entitled to Vote?\nOur Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on July 17, 2024 as the record date (the “Record Date”) for a determination of stockholders\nentitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting. On the Record Date, 3,502,037 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the\n“Common Stock”) were issued and outstanding, all of which are voting stock.\nVoting\nHolders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by them. There are no cumulative voting rights.\nWhat is the Difference Between Holding Shares as a Record Holder and as a Beneficial Owner?\nIf your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, you are the “record holder” of those shares. If you\nare a record holder, we will provide these proxy materials directly to you.\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of those shares held in\n“street name.” If your shares are held in street name, these proxy materials will be forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you have\nthe right to instruct such organization on how to vote your shares.\nWho May Attend the Meeting?\nRecord holders and beneficial owners may attend the Special Meeting. If your shares are held in street name, you will need to bring a copy of a\nbrokerage statement or other documentation reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date.\nHow Do I Vote?\nWhether you hold shares as a stockholder of record or as a beneficial owner, you may vote before the Special Meeting by granting a proxy or, for\nshares held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your bank, broker or nominee. Please refer to the instructions below.\n1\nRecord Holder\nIf you are a stockholder of record who owns shares directly in your name, you may vote your shares in one of the following ways:\nBy telephone. You may vote your shares by calling 1-800-690-6903.\nOver the Internet. Go to www.proxyvote.com. You will need to have your Control Number available when you access the\nwebsite. Your Control Number is on the Notice or proxy card that you received in the mail.\nBy mail. If you received printed proxy materials, you may submit your vote by completing, signing and dating each proxy card\nreceived and returning it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. Be sure to return your\nproxy card in time to be received and counted before the Special Meeting.\nDuring the Special Meeting. You may vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Special\nMeeting in person, we recommend that you also submit your proxy card or voting instructions, vote by telephone or via the\nInternet by the applicable deadline so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to virtually attend the meeting.\nIf you vote by telephone or via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, you must vote no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on August 22, 2024. You do not need to\nreturn a proxy card by mail. Voting electronically or by telephone is convenient, reduces the use of natural resources and saves significant postage and\nprocessing costs. Your vote is also recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays could cause your vote to arrive late and therefore not be\ncounted.\nBeneficial Owner (Holding Shares in Street Name)\nIf you are a beneficial owner who owns shares indirectly through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions in the Notice or\nvoting instructions that you receive from the broker or other nominee holding your shares. The availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on\nthe voting process of your broker or nominee. Shares held beneficially may be voted at the Special Meeting only if you provide a legal proxy from your\nbroker or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares.\nIs My Vote Confidential?\nYes, your vote is confidential. Only the following persons have access to your vote: election inspectors, individuals who help with processing and\ncounting your votes and persons who need access for legal reasons. If you write comments on your proxy card, your comments will be provided to the\nCompany, but how you vote will remain confidential.\nWhat Constitutes a Quorum?\nWe must have a quorum to carry on the business of the Special Meeting. Our Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) provide that the presence, in person or by proxy\nduly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at\nthe Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Broker non-votes (see definition below) and abstentions are not counted as present to determine the\nexistence of a quorum. The broker non-votes are not counted because there are no routine matters presented at the Special Meeting.\n2\nThe stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment,\nnotwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. In the absence of a quorum at the Special Meeting or any adjournment\nthereof, a majority in voting interest of those present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, or any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of,\nthe Special Meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting until stockholders holding the amount of stock requisite for a quorum are present in person or by\nproxy.\nWhat is a Broker Non-Vote?\nIf your shares are held in “street name,” you must instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares by following the\ninstructions that the broker or other nominee provides to you. Brokers usually offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by\ncompleting a vote instruction form, by telephone or over the Internet. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your\nshares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote, namely, “non-routine”\nmatters. This is called a “broker non-vote.” On the other hand, if you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, such party\nhas the discretion to vote your shares on “routine” matters.\nWhich Proposals are Considered “Routine” or “Non-Routine” for Brokers or Other Nominees?\nThe following Proposal is “non-routine” and thus a broker discretionary vote is not allowed:\nProposal 1, “To approve the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement, entered into as of June 24, 2024, by and between the\nCompany and investors, including, the issuance of 20% or more of our outstanding shares of Common Stock upon (i) exercise of Series A Common\nStock Purchase Warrant; and (ii) exercise of Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrant, each dated June 25, 2024.”\nHow Many Votes are Needed for Each Proposal to Pass and is Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed?\nFor matters at the Special Meeting, if a quorum is present, the following votes will be required for the Proposal to pass:\nBroker\nDiscretionary Vote\nProposal Vote Required Allowed\n1. Approve the Issuance of 20% or more of the The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority No\nCompany’s Outstanding Shares of Common Stock of the votes cast.\nHow are Abstentions Treated?\nAn abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but specifically indicates an abstention from voting on one or\nmore of the proposals. If you vote by Internet or telephone, or submit a proxy card or provide proxy instructions to your broker or other nominee, and\naffirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the meeting,\nbut will not be voted at the Special Meeting. Abstentions only have an effect on the outcome of any matter being voted on that requires a certain level of\napproval based on our total voting stock outstanding. Thus, abstentions by holders of Common Stock will have no effect on any of the proposals.\nWhat Are the Voting Procedures?\nIn voting by proxy on the proposal, you may vote for the proposal or against the proposal, or you may abstain from voting on the proposal. You should\nspecify your respective choices as discussed in the section “How Do I Vote?” on page 1.\nIs My Proxy Revocable?\nYou may revoke your proxy and reclaim your right to vote up to and including on the day of the Special Meeting by giving written notice to the\nCorporate Secretary of Digital Ally or by voting in person at the Special Meeting. If you provide more than one proxy, the proxy having the latest date will\nrevoke any earlier proxy. All written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocations of proxies should be addressed to: Digital\nAlly, Inc., 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215, telephone (913) 814-7774, Attention: Corporate Secretary.\n3\nWho is Paying for the Expenses Involved in Preparing and Mailing this Proxy Statement?\nWe will pay all the expenses involved in preparing, assembling, and mailing these proxy materials and all costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to the\nsolicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers and other employees by telephone or in person. Such persons will receive no compensation for\ntheir services other than their regular salaries. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to\nforward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the shares held of record by such persons, and we may reimburse such persons for reasonable out\nof pocket expenses incurred by them in so doing.\nWhat is “Householding” and How Does It Affect Me?\nRecord holders who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of the Special Meeting materials, unless we are notified that one\nor more of these record holders wishes to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure will reduce our printing costs and postage fees.\nIf you are eligible for householding, but you and other record holders with whom you share an address receive multiple copies of the Special Meeting\nmaterials, or if you hold Digital Ally stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy of each of these documents\nfor your household, please contact our transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, in writing: Mr. Matthew Smith, Securities Transfer Corporation,\n2901 N. Dallas Parkway, Suite 380, Plano, TX 75093; or by telephone: (469) 633-0101; or by facsimile: (469) 633-0088.\nIf you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the Special Meeting materials, or if you do not wish to continue to participate\nin householding and prefer to receive separate copies in the future, please contact Securities Transfer Corporation as indicated above.

The Company intends\nto use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for inventory purchases, artist costs for upcoming festivals, transaction cost, expanded sales, marketing,\npartial prepayment of an outstanding note and general working capital.\nAs part of the Private Placement, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,195,219 units and pre-funded units (collectively, the “Units”) at a purchase\nprice of $2.51 per unit (less $0.0001 per pre-funded unit). Each Unit consists of (i) one share of Common Stock (or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one\nshare of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”)), (ii) one Series A warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrant”) and (iii)\none Series B warrant to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock as will be determined on the Reset Date (as defined below) and in accordance\nwith the terms therein (the “Series B Warrant”, and together with the Series A Warrant, the “Warrants”).\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share of Common Stock and will not expire until exercised\nin full. The Series A Warrants will be exercisable at any time or times on or after the date Stockholder Approval (as defined below) is obtained, have an\ninitial exercise price of $2.51 per share of Common Stock and a term of 5 years after the later of (a) the date that the Company obtains the Stockholder\nApproval and (b) the earlier of (i) the Resale Effective Date (as defined below) registering all of the Registerable Securities or (ii) the date that the\nRegistrable Securities (as defined below) can be sold, assigned or transferred without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A\npromulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as amended, (or a successor rule thereto). The Series B Warrants will be exercisable at\nany time or times on or after the date Stockholder Approval is obtained, have an initial exercise price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock and will not\nexpire until exercised in full. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Series B Warrants will be determined following the earliest to\noccur of: (i) the date on which a resale registration statement covering the resale of all Registrable Securities has been declared effective for 20 consecutive\ntrading days, (ii) the date on which the Purchasers may sell the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act for a period of 20\nconsecutive trading days, and (iii) twelve months and 20 days following the issuance date of the Series B Warrants (the “Reset Date”), in each case,\npursuant to the lowest daily weighted average trading price of the shares of Common Stock during a period of 20 trading days, subject to a pricing floor of\n$0.502 per share of Common Stock (the “Floor Price”), such that, assuming the Floor Price, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock underlying\nthe Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants would be an aggregate of approximately 5,976,095 shares and 4,780,877 shares, respectively. The Company\nhas undertaken to file a resale registration statement covering all of the Registrable Securities on behalf the Purchasers pursuant to a registration rights\nagreement, also entered into with the Purchasers in connection with the Private Placement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company\nshall file the resale registration statement within twenty (20) trading days after the closing of the Private Placement, and the resale registration statement\nshall be effective within thirty (30) calendar days following the filing date (or, in the event of a full review by the SEC, fifty (50) calendar days following\nthe filing date).\n6\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants are subject to adjustment upon future\ndilutive issuances and stock combination events. Whenever on or after the subscription date, as long as the Series A Warrant is outstanding, the Company\nissues or sells any Common Stock for a consideration per share (the “New Issuance Price”) less than a price equal to the exercise price in effect\nimmediately prior to such issue or sale or deemed issuance or sale (the foregoing a “Dilutive Issuance”), then immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the\nexercise price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the lower of (a) the New Issuance Price or (b) the lowest weighted average price during\nthe 5 consecutive trading day period commencing on the date of the Dilutive Issuance (such lower price, the “Base Share Price”), and the number of shares\nof Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate exercise price of the Series A\nWarrant on the issuance date for the warrant shares then outstanding shall remain unchanged; provided that the Base Share Price shall not be less than the\nFloor Price. In addition to the adjustments set forth above, if at any time on or after the issuance date there occurs any share split, reverse share split, share\ndividend, share combination recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the Common Stock (each, a “Share Combination Event”, and such date\non which the Share Combination Event is effected, the “Share Combination Event Date”) and the lowest weighted average price of the Common Stock\nduring the period commencing on the trading day immediately following the applicable Share Combination Event Date and ending on the fifth (5th) trading\nday immediately following the applicable Share Combination Event Date (the “Event Market Price”) (provided if the Share Combination Event is effective\nprior to the opening of trading on the principal market, then, commencing on the Share Combination Event Date and ending on the fourth (4th) trading day\nimmediately following the applicable Share Combination Event Date (such period, the “Share Combination Adjustment Period”)) is less than the exercise\nprice then in effect, then, at the close of trading on the principal market on the last day of the Share Combination Adjustment Period, the exercise price then\nin effect on such 5th trading day shall be reduced (but in no event increased) to the Event Market Price and the number of warrant shares issuable upon\nexercise of the Series A Warrant shall be increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the\nexercise price, shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price on the issuance date for the warrant shares then outstanding; provided, however, that in no\nevent shall the event market price be lower than the Floor Price.\nThe Series A Warrant also includes a reset feature, where, on the Reset Date, the exercise price shall be adjusted to equal the lower of (i) the exercise\nprice then in effect and (ii) the Reset Price (as defined below) determined as of the date of determination. Upon such reset of the exercise price pursuant to\nthe Series A Warrant, the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrant shall be increased such that the aggregate exercise price\npayable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price on the issuance date for the\nwarrant shares then outstanding.\nPursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company shall hold a special meeting of stockholders at the earliest practicable date after the date\nof the Securities Purchase Agreement, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the closing date of the Private Placement for the purpose of obtaining\nStockholder Approval (the “Stockholder Approval”), and the Company shall solicit proxies from its stockholders in connection therewith in the same\nmanner as all other management proposals in such proxy statement and all management-appointed proxyholders shall vote their proxies in favor of such\nproposal. Within ten (10) business days following the closing date of the Private Placement, the Company shall file with the SEC this Proxy Statement to\nrequest for the purpose of obtaining Stockholder Approval. From the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement until six (6) months from the Release Date\n(as defined below), the Company and its subsidiaries shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to effect any issuance by the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined below) (or a combination of units thereof)\ninvolving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined below).\nAs defined in the Series A Warrants, each of the terms have the following meaning:\n“Resale Effective Date” means the earliest of the date that (a) the initial registration statement registering for resale the Registerable Securities\nhas been declared effective by the SEC, (b) all of the Registerable Securities have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 or may be sold pursuant to Rule 144\nwithout the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144 and without volume or manner-\nof-sale restrictions, (c) following the one year anniversary of the closing of the Private Placement provided that a holder of Registerable Securities is not an\naffiliate of the Company, or (d) all of the Registerable Securities may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(1) of the\nSecurities Act without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions and Company counsel has delivered to such holders a standing written unqualified opinion\nthat resales may then be made by such holders of the Registerable Securities pursuant to such exemption which opinion shall be in form and substance\nreasonably acceptable to such holders.\n“Reset Period” means the period commencing on the twentieth (20th) Trading Day immediately preceding the Reset Date and ending on the\nReset Date.\n“Reset Price” means the greater of (i) the lowest single day weighted average price of the Common Stock during the Reset Period and (ii) the\nFloor Price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, reorganizations, reclassification, combinations, reverse stock splits or other\nsimilar events occurring after the subscription date).\nAs defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement, each of the terms have the following meaning:\n“Common Stock Equivalents” means any securities of the Company which would entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time Common\nStock, including, without limitation, any debt, preferred stock, right, option, warrant or other instrument that is at any time convertible into or exercisable\nor exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the holder thereof to receive, Common Stock.\n“Release Date” means the later of (x) the earlier of (i) the Resale Effective Date registering all of the securities or (ii) the date that the securities\ncan be sold, assigned or transferred without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act and (y) the\ndate that the Company obtains the Stockholder Approval or a board approval in lieu of Stockholder Approval to effect the purposes of the Stockholder\nApproval.\n7\n“Variable Rate Transaction” means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock\nEquivalents either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon, and/or varies with, the trading prices of or\nquotations for the shares of Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities or (B) with a conversion, exercise or\nexchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified\nor contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common Stock, other than in connection with\ncustomary anti-dilution adjustments resulting from future stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions, or (ii) issues or sells any amortizing\nconvertible security that amortizes prior to its maturity date, whereby it is required to or has the option to (or the investor in such security has the option to\nrequire the Company to) make such amortization payments in Common Stock (whether or not such payments in stock are subject to certain equity\nconditions) or (iii) enters into, or effects a transaction under, any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit or “at-the-market”\noffering, whereby it may sell securities at a future determined price, regardless of whether Shares pursuant to such agreement have actually been issued and\nregardless of whether such agreement is subsequently canceled, provided that any issuance of shares upon the exercise of the Common Warrants issuable\nhereunder will not be deemed a Variable Rate Transaction.\nAs defined in the Registration Rights Agreement, the following term has the following meaning:\n“Registrable Securities” means, as of any date of determination, (a) all Common Stock, (b) all warrant shares then issued and issuable upon\nexercise of the Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants (assuming on such date the Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full without regard to\nany exercise limitations therein), and (c) any securities issued or then issuable upon any stock split, dividend or other distribution, recapitalization or\nsimilar event with respect to the foregoing; provided, however, that any such Registrable Securities shall cease to be Registrable Securities (and the\nCompany shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any, or file another, registration statement with respect thereto) for so long as (a) a\nregistration statement with respect to the sale of such Registrable Securities is declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act and such Registrable\nSecurities have been disposed of by the Purchaser in accordance with such effective registration statement, (b) such Registrable Securities have been\npreviously sold in accordance with Rule 144, or (c) such securities become eligible for resale and without the requirement for the Company to be in\ncompliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 (if such requirement is applicable) as set forth in a written opinion letter to\nsuch effect, addressed, delivered and acceptable to the transfer agent of the Company and the affected Purchasers (assuming that such securities and any\nsecurities issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of which, or as a dividend upon which, such securities were issued or are issuable, were at no\ntime held by any affiliate of the Company, as reasonably determined by the Company, upon the advice of counsel to the Company.\nEffect of Issuance of Additional Securities\nThe issuance of the securities described in this Proposal would result in the issuance of over 20% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common\nStock on a pre-transaction basis. As such, for so long as the Purchasers beneficially own a significant amount of shares of our Common Stock, they could\nsignificantly influence future Company decisions. Our stockholders will incur dilution of their percentage ownership to the extent that the Purchasers fully\nexercise the Warrants. Further, because of the possibility that the exercise price of the Warrants may be further adjusted to a lower amount, stockholders\nmay experience an even greater dilutive effect. Stockholder approval of Proposal No. 1 will apply to all issuances of Common Stock pursuant to the\nWarrants, including such potential issuance of additional shares.\nNasdaq Marketplace Requirements and the Necessity of Stockholder Approval\nThe Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market and, as such, the Company is subject to the Nasdaq rules. Nasdaq Marketplace\nRule 5635(d) requires the Company to obtain stockholder approval prior to the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection with certain non-public\nofferings involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock (and/or securities convertible into or exercisable\nfor shares of Common Stock) equal to 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding prior to such issuance where the price of the Common\nStock to be issued is below the “Minimum Price.” “Minimum Price” means a price that is the lower of: (i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected\non Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement; or (ii) the average Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the common stock (as\nreflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement. Shares of Common Stock issuable upon\nthe exercise or conversion of warrants, options, debt instruments, preferred stock or other equity securities issued or granted in such non-public offerings\nwill be considered shares issued in such a transaction in determining whether the 20% limit has been reached, except in certain circumstances such as\nissuing warrants that are not exercisable for a minimum of six months and have an exercise price that exceeds market value. The Company believes that the\ntransactions contemplated by the transaction documents in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, including full issuance of shares of\nCommon Stock upon the exercise of the Warrants into shares of Common Stock, may require stockholder approval.\nIf our stockholders do not approve this Proposal, (i) the Warrants will not be fully exercisable in a manner that complies with Nasdaq Marketplace\nRule 5635(d).\nAdditional Information\nThis summary is intended to provide you with basic information concerning the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Warrants. The full text of the\nSecurities Purchase Agreement and the form of Warrants were filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024.\nVote Required and Recommendation\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast will be required to approve the Nasdaq Proposal.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE TO APPROVE THE NASDAQ PROPOSAL.\n8\nFUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nThe Board has not yet determined the date on which the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held. Stockholders may submit proposals on\nmatters appropriate for stockholder action at annual meetings in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. Any proposal which an\neligible stockholder desires to have included in our proxy statement and presented at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be included in our\nproxy statement and related proxy card if it is received by us a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials and if it complies\nwith SEC rules regarding inclusion of proposals in proxy statements. In order to avoid controversy as to the date on which we receive a proposal, it is\nsuggested that any stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal submit such proposal by certified mail, return receipt requested.\nOther deadlines apply to the submission of stockholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders that are not required to be included in\nour proxy statement under SEC rules. With respect to these stockholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder’s notice must\nbe received by us a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. The form of proxy distributed by the Board for such meeting\nwill confer discretionary authority to vote on any such proposal not received by such date. If any such proposal is received by such date, the proxy\nstatement for the meeting will provide advice on the nature of the matter and how we intend to exercise our discretion to vote on each such matter if it is\npresented at that meeting.\nOTHER MATTERS\nThe Board of Directors knows of no other items that are likely to be brought before the Special Meeting except those that are set forth in the foregoing\nnotice of Special Meeting. However, if any other matter is properly presented at the Special Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the\nenclosed proxy to vote the shares they represent as the Board of Directors may recommend.\nBY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n/s/ Stanton E.

From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into a Plan\nof Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the “Predecessor Registrant”), we had not\nconducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc.\nOn January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DGLY.” We conduct our business from 14001\nMarshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774. Our website address is www.digitalallyinc.com. The contents of, or\ninformation accessible through, our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make our filings with the SEC, including our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as well as beneficial ownership\nfilings available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with, or furnish such reports to, the SEC. Our\nfilings with the SEC are available to the public through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nOn August 23, 2022 (the “Effective Time”), the Predecessor Registrant merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, DGLY Subsidiary Inc.,\na Nevada corporation (the “Registrant”), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 23, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), between the\nPredecessor Registrant and the Registrant, with the Registrant as the surviving corporation in the merger (such transaction, the “Merger”). At the Effective\nTime, Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, pursuant to which the Registrant was renamed “Digital Ally, Inc.”\nand, by operation of law, succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor Registrant immediately\nprior to the Merger. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, shareholder approval was not required in connection with the Merger Agreement or the\ntransactions contemplated thereby.\nAt the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) each outstanding share of Predecessor Registrant’s common stock, par value $0.001\nper share (the “Predecessor Common Stock”) automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Registrant\n(“Registrant Common Stock”), (ii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of Predecessor Common Stock converted into an option,\nright or warrant, as applicable, to acquire an equal number of shares of Registrant Common Stock under the same terms and conditions as the original\noptions, rights or warrants, and (iii) the directors and executive officers of the Predecessor Registrant were appointed as directors and executive officers, as\napplicable, of the Registrant, each to serve in the same capacity and for the same term as such person served with the Predecessor Registrant immediately\nbefore the Merger.\nFor the purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, (i) the term “our,” or “us” refers to the Predecessor\nRegistrant and its subsidiaries with respect to the period prior to the Effective Time and to the Registrant and its subsidiaries with respect to the period on\nand after the Effective Time; (ii) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to the “directors” mean the directors of the Predecessor Registrant,\nand, as of any period at and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Registrant, (iii) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to\n“stockholders” mean the holders of Predecessor Common Stock, and, as of any period at and after the Effective Time, the holders of Registrant Common\nStock, and (iv) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to “Common Stock” means the Predecessor Common Stock, and, as of any period at\nand after the Effective Time, Registrant Common Stock.\n2\nThe business of the Registrant, Digital Ally, Inc. (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC,\nDigital Ally Healthcare, LLC (“Digital Ally Healthcare”), TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”), Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc.,\nBirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440 (“Kustom 440”), Inc., Kustom Entertainment, Inc. (“Kustom”), and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC,\ncollectively, “Digital Ally,” “Digital,” and the “Company”), is divided into three reportable operating segments: 1) the Video Solutions Segment, 2) the\nRevenue Cycle Management Segment and 3) the Entertainment Segment. The Video Solutions Segment is our legacy business that produces digital video\nimaging, storage products, disinfectant and related safety products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. This segment includes\nboth service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety\nsolutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout\nthe country, as a monthly service fee. The Entertainment Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing\nplatform, ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The accounting guidance on Segment\nReporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of\nthose segments to be presented in financial statements. The following table sets forth the Company’s total revenue and the revenue derived from each\nreportable operating segment:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet Revenues:\nVideo Solutions $ 7,471,285 $ 8,252,288\nRevenue Cycle Management 6,713,678 7,886,107\nEntertainment 14,063,381 20,871,500\nTotal Net Revenues $ 28,248,344 $ 37,009,895\nAdditional information regarding each reportable operating segment is also included in Note 23 entitled Segment Data of “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements”.\nVideo Solutions Operating Segment\nWithin our video solutions operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording\ncapabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets.

We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in\n2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that\nprovides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers\nwhich are for use against viruses and bacteria.\nOur video solutions segment revenue encompasses video recording products and services for our law enforcement and commercial customers and\nthe sale of ShieldTM disinfectant and personal protective products. This segment generates revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and\nwarranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and personal protective safety products and solutions. Revenues for product sales are recognized upon\ndelivery of the product, and revenues from our cloud and warranty subscription plans are deferred over the term of the subscription, typically 3 or 5 years.\nRevenue Cycle Management Operating Segment\nWe entered the revenue cycle management business late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital\nAlly Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”). Nobility Healthcare completed its first\nacquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and has since completed three more acquisitions of private medical\nbilling companies, in which we assist in providing working capital and back-office services to healthcare organizations throughout the country. Our\nassistance consists of insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation and coding, and collections. Through our expertise and\nexperience in this field, we aim to maximize our customers’ service revenues collected, leading to substantial improvements in their operating margins and\ncash flows.\n3\nOur revenue cycle management segment consists of our medical billing subsidiaries. Revenues of this segment are recognized after we perform\nthe obligations of our revenue cycle management services. Our revenue cycle management services are services, performed and charged monthly, generally\nbased on a contractual percentage of total customer collections, for which we recognize our net service fees.\nEntertainment Operating Segment\nWe also provide live entertainment and events ticketing services through the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc.\n(“TicketSmarter”) and its completed acquisitions of Goody Tickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, on September 1, 2021.

Revenues of this segment include ticketing service charges generally determined as a percentage of the face value of the underlying\nticket and ticket sales from our ticket inventory which are recognized when the underlying tickets are sold. Entertainment direct expenses include the cost\nof tickets purchased for resale by the Company and held as inventory, credit card fees, ticketing platform expenses, website maintenance fees, along with\nother administrative costs.\nBusiness Combination\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “CLOE Merger Agreement”) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp.,\na Delaware corporation (“Clover Leaf”), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (“Merger Sub”),\nYntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Yntegra”), in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time\nfor the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CLOE Merger Agreement (the “Sponsor” or the “Purchaser\nRepresentative”), and Kustom, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and\nsecondary ticketing technologies.\nPursuant to the CLOE Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the CLOE Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom (the “Merger” and, together with the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”), with Kustom continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and\na wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. In the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Kustom immediately prior to the effective time\nshall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist in exchange for the right for the Company to receive the Merger\nConsideration (as defined below). Upon consummation of the Business Combination, Clover Leaf will change its name to “Kustom Entertainment, Inc.”\nThe aggregate merger consideration to be paid pursuant to the CLOE Merger Agreement to the Company as of immediately prior to the effective\ntime will be an amount equal to (the “Merger Consideration”) (i) $125 million, minus (ii) the estimated consolidated indebtedness of Kustom as of the\nClosing (“Closing Indebtedness”). The Merger Consideration to be paid to the Company will be paid solely by the delivery of new shares of Clover Leaf\nClass A Common Stock, each valued at $11.14 per share (the “Merger Consideration Shares”). The Closing Indebtedness (and the resulting Merger\nConsideration) is based solely on estimates determined shortly prior to the Closing and is not subject to any post-Closing true-up or adjustment.\nKustom is comprised of TicketSmarter and Kustom 440, both currently wholly owned subsidiaries. Both TicketSmarter and Kustom 440 will\ncombine their management teams and focus on concerts, entertainment and garnering additional ticketing partnerships in 2024 and beyond. Kustom 440\nand TicketSmarter will use their existing sponsorships and sports property partnerships to develop alternative entertainment options for consumers.\nThe combined company will be known as Kustom Entertainment and will operate under the same management team as Kustom which is currently\nled by Stanton E. Ross, the current CEO of the Company. The transaction contemplates an equity value of $125 million for Kustom. The combined\ncompany is expected to have an implied initial pro forma equity value of approximately $222.2 million, with the proposed Business Combination expected\nto provide approximately $18.1 million in gross proceeds from the cash held in trust by Clover Leaf, assuming no redemptions. Additionally, the Company\nwill distribute to its shareholders 20% of the Merger Consideration Shares obtained in Kustom immediately following the closing of the Merger and intends\nto distribute the balance of such Merger Consideration Shares following a six-month lock-up period.\nThe transaction has been approved by the board of directors of the Company (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) and the board of directors of\nClover Leaf and is subject to approval by the stockholders of Clover Leaf and other customary closing conditions. The Company, as the sole holder of\nKustom common stock, has approved the transaction.\nDue to the plan to consummate the Business Combination, the Company no longer expects to pursue a separation of Kustom into its own\nindependent publicly traded company via spin-off, as announced on December 8, 2022.\nIn October 2023, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 4, 2023, relating to the previously announced proposed Business Combination.\nIn December 2023, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of the Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form\nS-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC on December 8, 2023, relating to the previously announced proposed Business Combination.\nIn February 2024, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of the Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form S-\n4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC on February 5, 2024, relating to the previously announced proposed Business Combination.\nOur Video Solutions Operating Segment Products and Services\nThrough our video solutions operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording\ncapabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate\nelectronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the\nEVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, which are in-car digital video systems for law enforcement and commercial markets; the FirstVu body-worn\ncamera line, consisting of the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu, and the FirstVu HD; our patented and revolutionary VuLink product integrates our body-worn cameras\nwith our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement and commercial markets; the EVO Fleet, FLT-250, DVM-\n250, and DVM-250 Plus, which are our commercial line of digital video products that serve as “event recorders” for the commercial fleet and mass transit\nmarkets; and FleetVu and VuLink, which are our cloud-based evidence management systems. We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in\n2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that\nprovides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers\nwhich are for use against viruses and bacteria.\n4\nIn-Car Digital Video Mirror System for Law Enforcement – EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite\nIn-car video systems for patrol cars are a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based systems with\ncameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat of the vehicle.\nThe Company launched its in-car digital video platform under the name EVO-HD during the second quarter of 2019. The EVO-HD is a\nrevolutionary in-car system that delivers versatility and reliability for law enforcement.\nWith built-in, patented auto-activation technology, EVO-HD captures multiple recording angles in sync from a FirstVu PRO or FirstVu HD body-\nworn camera and up to four HD in-car cameras – all from a single trigger. The EVO-HD maximizes space and offers top-end reliability when paired with\nremote service capabilities. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the VuVault.net cloud, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and\nreal time metadata when in the field.\nThe Company offers the DVM-800, a continuation in the family of highly successful digital video mirrored (DVM) systems developed by the\nCompany. The DVM-800 is a time-tested, compact, powerful and easy-to-use solution designed for law enforcement. The DVM-800 system has built-in\nroad and driver facing cameras and can record up to two external HD cameras. The DVM-800 is compatible with the patented VuLink® auto-activation\ntechnology and can be paired with a FirstVu HD body-worn camera.\nThe Company also offers the DVM-800 Lite, an entry level system is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that\nis integrated into a rear-view mirror and is designed for law enforcement. The system can record up to two internal HD cameras.\nIn-Car Digital Video “Event Recorder” System – EVO Fleet, DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 for Commercial Fleets\nDigital Ally provides commercial fleets and commercial fleet managers with the digital video tools that they need to increase driver safety, track\nassets in real-time and minimize the company’s liability risk while enabling fleet managers to operate the fleet at an optimal level. We market a product\ndesigned to address these commercial fleet markets with our EVO Fleet, DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 event recorders that provide various types of\ncommercial fleets with features and capabilities that are fully-customizable and consistent with their specific application and inherent risks.\nThe DVM-250 Plus is a part of the DVM family and is designed for commercial fleets featuring built-in digital audio and video recording\ntechnology and other features to provide commercial fleet managers unmatched driver and asset management – all while aiming to deliver the return on\ninvestment that matters most: the safety and security of drivers and passengers. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture events, such as wrecks and\nerratic driving or other abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. The commercial fleet markets may find our units attractive from both a\nfeature and a cost perspective compared to other providers. Due to our marketing efforts, commercial fleets are beginning to adopt this technology, and in\nparticular, the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.\nThe FLT-250 offers the same great features of the DVM-250 Plus in a new compact, non-mirrored form factor that allows for multiple mounting\noptions in any vehicle type for commercial fleets. The non-mirror-based aspect of this product, allowed the FLT-250 to become more attractive for our\npotential customers, as it is a much simpler plug and play option compared to mirror-based products.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Digital Ally released the EVO Fleet, offering a full-featured solution utilizing the latest in telematics technology,\nincluding immediate driver-assist feedback by recognizing pedestrians, distracted or drowsy driving, and lane shifting. We believe that, due to the new\ntechnology, including the A.I. interface, live tracking capabilities, up to four streams of video, and video on command, this product will become a very\nprominent product in the market and for our current and potential customers.\nDigital Ally offers a suite of data management web-based tools to assist fleet managers in the organization, archival, and management of videos\nand telematics information. Within the suite, there are powerful mapping and reporting tools that are intended to optimize efficiency, serve as training tools\nfor teams on safety, and, ultimately, generate a significant return on investment for the organization.\n5\nThe EVO-HD has become the platform for a new family of in-car video solution products for the commercial markets. The innovative EVO-HD\ntechnology replaces the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle, while offering\nnumerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of our commercial customers. In its commercial market application, the\nEVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and ECA capabilities to allow customers to review entire shifts. An\ninternal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the FleetVu Manager cloud-based system for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring, which is\npowered by AWS and real time metadata when in the field.\nBody-Worn Digital Video System – FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and FirstVu HD for Law Enforcement and Private Security\nDigital Ally launched two next generation body-worn cameras and docking stations, refreshing the Company’s complete ecosystem of evidence\nrecording devices. The latest body worn camera launched by the Company is the FirstVu Pro, the Company’s flagship product in its family of next\ngeneration of technology. The light weight, one-piece unit captures full HD video and audio, while offering industry leading features such as live\nstreaming, a full-color touchscreen display, an advanced image sensor with IR LEDs, proprietary image distortion reduction, IP67 rated resisting dust and\nwind and is water submersible for 30 minutes at a depth of 3 feet. It is also MIL-STD-810G compliant capable of handling drops, shock, and vibration, and\nwill function flawlessly in a wide temperature range.\nIn addition to the FirstVu Pro, Digital Ally also added the FirstVu II to its family of next generation technology. The FirstVu II is a one-piece\ndevice offering industry leading technology such as an articulating camera head, a full-color display, an advanced image sensor, and GPS. It can be used in\nlaw enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments.\nDigital Ally still carries the FirstVu HD, the two-piece body-worn camera which allows for multiple mounting options while minimizing space\nand weight. It can be used in law enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments. This system is also a derivative of our in-car video\nsystems, but is much smaller and lighter and more rugged and water-resistant to handle a hostile outdoor environment. The FirstVu HD can be used in\nmany applications in addition to law enforcement and private security and is designed specifically to be clipped to an individual’s pocket or other outer\nclothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage devices. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through\nour patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.\nWith the newly introduced body-worn cameras, Digital Ally also introduced two new QuickVu docking stations compatible with the FirstVu PRO\nand FirstVu II body-worn cameras. The QuickVu docking stations provide a comprehensive and elegant solution for storing and charging body cameras\nwhile uploading video evidence to the cloud. QuickVu also allows for rapid reviewing of footage right from the interactive touchscreen display, and is\navailable in eight or twenty-four individual docking bays. For docking with the FirstVu HD body-worn cameras, Digital Ally offers a 12-bay docking\nstation and Mini-Docks. The 12-bay docking station includes a 1TB local memory hard drive which simultaneously upload 4 hours of video from 12\nFirstVu HD cameras within a 15-minute shift change and push configuration updates. The Mini-Dock is a single unit, portable smart dock that uploads\nvideo evidence to VuVault from a FirstVu HD body camera.\nAuto-activation and Interconnectivity Between In-car Video Systems and Body-worn Camera Products – VuLink for Law Enforcement\nRecognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provides\nintuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the\n“USPTO”) has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering a variety of triggers, including emergency lights\nand sirens, extreme acceleration or braking, g-force or any 12-volt relay. Additionally, the awarded patent claims cover automatic coordination between\nmultiple recording devices. Prior to our VuLink ecosystem, officers had to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios, a\nrequirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers’ attention during critical moments.\n6\nEVO Web and FleetVu Manager\nEVO Web is a web-based software, powered by and hosted on the AWS GovCloud platform, that enables police departments and security agencies\nto manage digital video evidence quickly and easily. EVO Web is capable of playing back, reviewing, downloading, archiving, unit configuration and\nmanagement, running customizable reports and maintaining a chain of custody logs. AWS is the most secure cloud platform on the market with features\nthat go beyond simply storing and reviewing video evidence. AWS GovCloud platform is trusted by the Department of Justice, Defense Digital Services for\nthe US Air Force, U.S. Department of Treasury, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Our products that are compatible with EVO Web include:\nFirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, FirstVu HD, QuickVu, EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite.\nFleetVu Manager is a web-based software that provides commercial fleet managers with the tools to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time\nand minimize their companies’ liability risks.

ThermoVu has optional features such as facial recognition to improve facility security by\nrestricting access based on temperature and/or facial recognition reasons. ThermoVu provides an instant pass/fail audible tone with its temperature display\nand controls access to facilities based on such results.\nThe Company has been distributing other personal protective equipment and supplies, since the second quarter of 2021, such as masks and gloves\nto supplement its Shield brand of products to health care workers as well as other consumers, consisting of vinyl and nitrile gloves, level 3 and N95 NIOSH\ncertified face masks, and disposable wipes.\nOur Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment Products and Services\nThrough our revenue cycle management segment, we provide assistance in providing working capital and back-office services to healthcare\norganizations throughout the country. Our RCM operating segment services consist of insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation\nand coding, and collections. Through our expertise and experience in this field, we maximize our customers’ service revenues collected, leading to\nsubstantial improvements in their operating margins and cash flows. We generally receive a service fee based on a percentage of the service revenues\ncollected by our customers.\nOur Entertainment Operating Segment Products and Services\nThrough our entertainment segment, we provide customers with access to the online live event ticketing marketplace through our online platform -\nTicketSmarter.com. Offering over 48 million tickets for sale for over 125,000 live events, TicketSmarter is a national ticket marketplace offering tickets\nfor live events featuring sports, concerts and theatre. TicketSmarter is the official ticket resale partner of more than 35 collegiate conferences, over 300\nuniversities, and hundreds of events and venues.\n7\nEstablished in late 2022, Kustom 440 is another piece of the entertainment segment of the Company, whose mission it is to attract, manage and\npromote concerts, sports and private events. Kustom 440 offers the production and promotion of live music events in third-party venues throughout the\ncountry. These services begin with the logistical matters of an event, including artist booking and research, ticketing, staging, on-site operations, vendor\nsourcing, and day of production. These events range in size from small corporate events to full stadium multi-day events.\nOur entertainment operating segment primarily receives compensation for its services generally determined as a percentage of the face-value of\nthe tickets being purchased. Our entertainment operating segment also provides customers with access to tickets which it has purchased or received in\nreturn for its sponsorship or partnership from the venue, event or owner.\nMarket and Industry Overview – Video Solutions Operating Segment\nOur video solutions segment has historically had a primary market of domestic and international law enforcement agencies. We have since\nexpanded our scope by pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. Additionally, we have expanded into event security services where\nwe provide the hardware and software to supplement private security for NASCAR races, football and other sporting events, concerts and other events\nwhere people gather. We continue to further expand our focus on private security, homeland security, mass transit, healthcare, general retail, educational,\ngeneral consumer and other commercial markets. In that regard, we have several installations involving private security on cruise ships and similar markets.\nWe believe there are many potential private uses of our product offerings. We continue to have sales in the commercial fleet and ambulance service\nprovider market, confirming that our EVO Fleet, DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 products and FleetVu Manager can become a significant revenue producer\nfor us. Additionally, our body-worn cameras have applications in law enforcement, along with private and event security, as well as commercial segments.\nWith the recent acquisitions we completed in 2021 and 2022, we hope to utilize the connections we now have to live events, stadiums, and arenas, as well\nas new medical connections.\nMarket and Industry Overview – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment\nOur revenue cycle management segment consists of end-to-end revenue cycle management services that focuses on claim reimbursement billing,\nverification, and related services to medical providers throughout the country. We offer agreements with customers in which we provide our services and\nbill the customers monthly for our services. The healthcare industry in the United States represents a strong portion of the United States’ economy, offering\na robust market for these services. Our current market includes many diverse specialties, including radiology, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, internal\nmedicine, and cardiology. We continue to investigate ways to expand our market reach, although can make no assurances in that regard.\nMarket and Industry Overview – Entertainment Operating Segment\nOur entertainment segment refers to the sale of event tickets primarily through our online and mobile platforms. We will buy inventory of event\ntickets to then sell tickets through various platforms, including our own. Our resale services refer to the sale of tickets by a holder, who originally obtained\nthe tickets directly from a venue or entity, through our platform in which we then collect services fees on the transaction. This is commonly referred to as\nsecondary ticketing. We work directly with consumers looking to buy or sell event tickets for particular shows, concerts, games, and other events, allowing\na simple and effective platform to move tickets. We also offer production and promotion of live music events in third-party venues throughout the country.\nThese services begin with the logistical matters of an event, including artist booking and research, ticketing, staging, on-site operations, vendor sourcing,\nand day of production.\nCompetition - Video Solutions Operating Segment\nOur video solutions segment, consisting of law enforcement and security surveillance markets, is extremely competitive. Competitive factors in\nthese industries include ease of use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct competitors with technology and products\nin the law enforcement and surveillance markets for all of our products, including those that are in development. Many of these competitors have\nsignificant advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger\ncustomer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors in the in-\ncar video systems market include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video (“WatchGuard”),\nKustom Signals, Panasonic System Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell, or may\nin the future sell, in-car video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include Axon Enterprises,\nInc. (“Axon”), Reveal Media, WatchGuard, and VieVU, Inc., which was acquired by Axon in 2018. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our\nevent recorders in the commercial fleet and private security markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. There can be no\nassurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that new and existing companies will not enter\nthe law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future. The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets likewise are also very\ncompetitive. There are direct competitors for our FLT-250 and DVM-250 Plus “event recorders,” which may have greater financial, technical marketing,\nand manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and\nSmartDrive Systems, among others.\n8\nCompetition – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment\nOur revenue cycle management segment is a highly competitive market that is only intensifying as the market continues to grow. We face\ncompetition from a variety of sources, including internal revenue cycle management departments within healthcare organizations, as these organizations are\nbeginning to make internal investments in these departments to keep these services in-house. Additionally, other revenue cycle management providers exist\nand offer similar services through software vendors, traditional consultants, and information technology sources.\nCompetition – Entertainment Operating Segment\nOur entertainment segment faces robust competition from several sources throughout the industry. As the online and mobile ticketing market\ncontinues to increase, it has allowed for more technology-based companies to offer ticketing services and systems. The online environment consists of\nnumerous other websites and platforms for all markets. With the market continuing to grow, resale marketplaces and websites can reach a vastly larger\naudience with more convenient access to tickets for a wide variety of events. We continue to build our brand and recognition, through numerous\npartnerships and sponsorships throughout the country, in attempt to become a preferred platform for consumers. The event production portion of this\nsegment faces strong competition ranging from small festival production companies to large concert production companies and venues.\nWorldwide Reinsurance Ltd.\nIn December 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd. (“Worldwide Re”), a Bermuda incorporated\ncaptive insurance company that provided primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently available or\neconomically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace.\nWorldwide Re is subject to capital and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). Although these\ncapital requirements are generally less constraining than U.S. capital requirements, failure to satisfy these requirements could result in regulatory actions\nfrom the BMA or loss of or modification of Worldwide Re’s Class 1 insurer license, which could adversely impact our ability to support our insurance\nneeds and to grow this business into another line of business for our holding company. To date, our captive’s relatively immature claims history limits the\npredictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims. Accordingly, the captive could continue to incur significant fluctuations in financial\nresults as the captive provides insurance coverage to Digital Ally and its affiliated businesses and seeks to expand beyond our affiliated companies to offer\ncoverage for third parties.\nIntellectual Property – Video Solutions Operating Segment\nOur video solutions operating segment’s ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in\nthe United States and abroad. We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our\nproducts.\n9\nSome of our patent applications are still under review by the USPTO and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all the patents that we applied for\nin the United States. We were issued several patents in recent years, including a patent on our VuLink product that provides automatic triggering of our\nbody-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing technology will be issued\nfrom the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on our\ncontinued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United States will be sufficient to deter others, legally\nor otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies.\nWe have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our FirstVu Pro &\nFirstVu II body cameras, QuickVu docking stations, EVO Fleet, DVM-250 and DVM-800 products. These supply and distribution agreements contain\ncertain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary technology, as well as that of the third-party manufacturers.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and\nthereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our\nemployees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our\nrights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially\nequivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.\nIntellectual Property – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment\nOur revenue cycle management’s operating segment’s ability to compete effectively primarily depends on our trade secrets and know-how and\ndoes not depend heavily on any proprietary technology or patents.\nIntellectual Property – Entertainment Operating Segment\nOur entertainment operating segment’s ability to compete effectively primarily depends on our trade secrets and know-how and does not depend\nheavily on any proprietary technology or patents.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, Digital Ally, and its subsidiaries, had approximately 170 full-time employees spread throughout the country,\nrepresenting the core values and objectives of the Company. These employees are spread amongst our operating segments as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2023\nEmployee headcount:\nVideo Solutions 98\nRevenue Cycle Management [1] 60\nEntertainment 12\nTotal Employee Headcount 170\n[1] Our revenue cycle management operating segment has no direct employees. Nobility Healthcare, our minority interest partner provides all\nhuman capital resources to manage and operate the Company’s revenue cycle management operating segment.\n10\nOur employees are our most important assets and they set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. All of our employees\ncontribute to Digital Ally’s success and, in particular, the employees in our manufacturing, sales, research and development, and quality assurance\ndepartments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance, advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and\ncompliance program.\nOur employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We strive to create a\nculture and work environment that enables us to attract, train, promote, and retain a diverse group of talented employees who together can help us gain a\ncompetitive advantage. Our key programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n● Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits: the main objective of Digital Ally’s compensation program is to provide a compensation\npackage that will attract, retain, motivate and reward superior employees who must operate in a highly competitive and technologically\nchallenging environment. We seek to do this by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each\nindividual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial\ninterests with the interests of shareholders. Digital Ally also seeks fairness in total compensation with reference to external comparisons, internal\ncomparisons and the relationship between management and non-management remuneration. The structure of our compensation programs balances\nincentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:\n● We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic\nlocation.\n● We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance.\n● Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented\nthrough our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion.\n● All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, short-term disability, worker’s compensation, long-term disability, a\nretirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the\noptions that meet their needs.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nNot applicable.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nRisk management and strategy\nWe assess material risks from cybersecurity threats on an ongoing basis, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through\nour information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information\nresiding therein. As our Company grows, we plan to develop a more robust and detailed strategy for cybersecurity in alignment with nationally accepted\nstandards. We have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.\nGovernance\nOur management and the Board recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our business partners and employees,\nincluding the importance of managing cybersecurity risks as part of our larger risk management program. While all of our personnel play a part in\nmanaging cybersecurity risks, one of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from\ncybersecurity threats. Our Board is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the material risks that we face. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach that is focused\non preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing, and mitigating\ncybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOn May 13, 2020, the Company entered into an operating lease for new warehouse and office space which had served as its principal executive\noffice and primary business location, prior to the completed building purchase.

Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose the\nspecifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and assuming\nwe determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against us. We record a\nliability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not probable, we determine whether\nit is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for\naccrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and\ncircumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update\naccruals as matters progress over time.\nWhile the ultimate resolution is unknown, we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect\nto our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance\nthat any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in\nexcess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or\ncash flows.\nCulp McCauley\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit against Culp McAuley, Inc. (“defendant”) in the United States District Court for the District of\nKansas. The lawsuit arises from the defendant’s multiple breaches of its obligations to the Company. The Company seeks monetary damages and injunctive\nrelief based on certain conduct by the defendant. On July 18, 2022, the defendant filed its Answer to the Company’s Verified Complaint and included\nCounterclaims alleging breach of contract and seeking monetary damages. On August 8, 2022, the Company filed its Reply and Affirmative Defenses to\nthe Counterclaims by, among other things, denying the allegations and any and all liability. During the second quarter of 2023, we concluded that a $1.8\nmillion loss related to the allegations is probable, with no conclusion on the remaining $2.2 million being a probable loss related to these claims. Although\nwe believe a further loss could be reasonably possible (as defined in ASC 450), we do not have sufficient information to determine the amount or range of\nreasonably possible loss with respect to the potential damages given that the dispute is yet to enter the discovery process. We will continue to vigorously\npursue these claims, and we continue to believe that we have valid grounds for recovery of the disputed deliverables. However, there can be no assurances\nas to the outcome of the dispute.\n12\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5.

The following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly\nbasis:\nFor the Three Months Ended:\nDecember September June 30, March 31, December September June 30, March 31,\n31, 2023 30, 2023 2023 2023 31, 2022 30, 2022 2022 2022\nTotal revenue $ 6,228,351 $ 6,337,699 $ 8,062,097 $ 7,620,197 $ 8,879,504 $ 8,484,153 $ 9,351,457 $10,294,781\nGross profit 549,031 1,226,149 2,519,505 1,467,799 (1,932,256) 595,500 1,719,078 1,939,619\nGross profit margin percentage 8.8% 19.3% 31.3% 19.3% (21.8)% 7.0% 18.4% 18.8%\nTotal selling, general and\nadministrative expenses 6,528,031 6,374,192 7,460,209 7,640,605 7,769,389 7,162,523 8,380,330 8,742,957\nOperating loss (5,979,000) (5,148,043) (4,940,704) (6,172,806) (9,701,645) (6,567,023) (6,661,252) (6,803,338)\nOperating loss percentage (96.0)% (81.2)% (61.3)% (81.0)% (109.3)% (77.4)% (71.2)% (66.1)%\nNet income/(loss) $(7,484,778) $(3,679,043) $(8,320,549) $(5,979,579) $(9,574,258) $(1,919,071) $ (682,187) $ (6,698,242)\nOur business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating results in\nthe above table. These variations result from various factors, including but not limited to: (1) the timing of large individual orders; (2) the traction gained\nby products, such as the recently released FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, FLT-250, EVO HD, the ThermoVu™ and the Shield™ lines; (3) production, quality and\nother supply chain issues affecting our cost of goods sold; (4) unusual increases in operating expenses, such as the timing of trade shows and stock-based\nand bonus compensation; (5) the timing of patent infringement litigation settlements (6) ongoing patent and other litigation and related expenses respecting\noutstanding lawsuits; and (7) the completion of corporate acquisitions including the recent purchases in the revenue cycle management and entertainment\noperating segments. We reported net loss of $7,484,778 on revenues of $6,228,351 for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe factors and trends affecting our recent performance include:\n● The Company formed two new operating segments in 2021 and continued to make acquisitions within these segments in 2021 and 2022\nresulting in increased revenues and costs. The Company has since focused on the profitability of these segments and resulting in fluctuating\nrevenues and costs on a quarterly basis. The entertainment operating segment generated $14,063,381 and $20,871,500 in revenue during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $6,808,119 (33%). The revenue cycle management operating segment\ngenerated $6,713,678 and $7,886,107 in revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,172,429\n(15%). We expect to continue to experience improved results from our two new operating segments and their recent acquisitions, along with\nimproved results from the video solutions segment as the recurring revenue model expands.\n● Our objective is to expand our video solutions segment’s recurring service revenue to help stabilize our revenues on a quarterly basis.\nRevenues from cloud storages have been increasing in recent quarters and reached approximately $572,892 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an\nincrease of $141,725 (33%) over the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall, cloud revenues increased to approximately $1,994,066 for the year\nended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $1,471,860 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $522,206, or 35%.\nWe are pursuing several new market channels outside of our traditional law enforcement and private security customers, similar to our\nNASCAR and event security customers, which we believe will help expand the appeal of our products and service capabilities to new\ncommercial markets. If successful, we believe that these new market channels could yield recurring service revenues for us in the future.\n17\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other\nrelationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in the\nfinancial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.\nWe are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments (described in Note 15, “Commitments\nand Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements) and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent\ncommitments to future payments for goods and services.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nSummarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub-sections is an analysis of our operating results for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue 100% 100%\nCost of revenue 80% 94%\nGross profit 20% 6%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses:\nResearch and development expense 9% 6%\nSelling, advertising and promotional expense 25% 25%\nGeneral and administrative expense 65% 55%\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses 99% 86%\nOperating loss (79)% (80)%\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities 7% 18%\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration promissory notes and earn-\nout agreements 1% 1%\nGain on extinguishment of warrant derivative liability —% 10%\nLoss on accrual for legal settlement (6)% —%\nLoss on extinguishment of convertible debt (4)% —%\nGain on extinguishment of debt 2% —%\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment —% 1%\nInterest expense (11)% —%\nInterest income and other income, net 1% (1)%\nLoss before income tax benefit (89)% (51)%\nIncome tax expense (benefit) —% —%\nNet loss (89)% (51)%\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiary (1)% (1)%\nLoss on redemption – Series A & B convertible redeemable preferred stock —% (6)%\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders (90)% (58)%\nNet loss per share information:\nBasic $ (9.22) $ (8.50)\nDiluted $ (9.22) $ (8.50)\n18\nRevenues\nRevenues by Type and by Operating Segment\nOur operating segments generate two types of revenues:\nProduct revenues primarily includes video solutions operating segment hardware sales of in-car and body-worn cameras, along with sales of our\nThermoVuTM units, disinfectants, and personal protective equipment.

The distributor retains the margin as compensation\nfor its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory, customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of\nownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement.\n● Repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees.

Service revenues are generally determined as\na percentage of the dollar amount of medical billings collected by the customer.\nOur entertainment operating segment sells our products and services to customers in the following manner:\n● Our entertainment operating segment generates product revenues from the sale of tickets directly to consumers for a particular event that the\nentertainment operating segment has previously purchased and held in inventory for ultimate resale to the end consumer. Service sales\nthrough TicketSmarter, are driven largely in part to the usage of the TicketSmarter.com marketplace by buyers and sellers, in which the\nCompany collects service fees for each transaction completed through this platform.\nWe may discount our prices on specific orders based upon the size of the order, the specific customer and the competitive landscape.\nProduct revenues by operating segment is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nProduct Revenues:\nVideo Solutions $ 4,303,369 $ 5,401,089\nRevenue Cycle Management — —\nEntertainment 5,044,576 5,598,803\nTotal Product Revenues $ 9,347,495 $ 10,999,892\nProduct revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $9,347,495 and $10,999,892, respectively, a decrease of $1,651,947 (15%), due to\nthe following factors:\n● Revenues generated by the entertainment operating segment began with the Company’s acquisition of TicketSmarter on September 1,\n2021. The entertainment operating segment generated $5,044,576 in product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto $5,598,803 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. This largely relates to the Company focusing on right sizing and reducing\ncosts and working towards profitability.\n● The Company’s video solutions operating segment generated product revenues totaling $4,303,369 during the year ended December 31,\n2023 compared to $5,401,089 for the year ended December 31, 2022. In general, our video solutions operating segment has experienced\npressure on its product revenues as our in-car and body-worn systems are facing increased competition because our competitors have\nreleased new products with advanced features. Additionally, our law enforcement revenues declined over the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 due to price-cutting and competitive actions by our competitors, adverse marketplace effects related to our patent\nlitigation proceedings and our recent financial condition.\n● Our video solutions operating segment management has continued to focus on migrating commercial customers, from a hardware sale to\na service fee model. Therefore, we expect a reduction in commercial hardware sales (principally DVM-250’s, FLT-250’s, and a portion of\nour body-worn camera line) as we convert these customers to a service model under which we provide the hardware as part of a recurring\nmonthly service fee. In that respect, we introduced a monthly subscription agreement plan for our body worn cameras and related\nequipment during the second quarter of 2020 that allowed law enforcement agencies to pay a monthly service fee to obtain body worn\ncameras without incurring a significant upfront capital outlay. This program has gained some traction, resulting in decreased product\nrevenues and increasing our service revenues. We expect this program to continue to hold traction, resulting in recurring revenues over a\nspan of three to five years.\n20\nService and other revenues by operating segment is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nService and Other Revenues:\nVideo Solutions $ 3,167,916 $ 2,851,199\nRevenue Cycle Management 6,713,678 7,886,107\nEntertainment 9,018,805 15,272,697\nTotal Service and Other Revenues $ 18,900,399 $ 26,010,003\nService and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $18,900,399 and $26,010,003, respectively, a decrease of $7,109,604\n(27%), due to the following factors:\n● Cloud revenues generated by the video solutions operating segment were $1,994,066 and $1,471,860 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $522,206 (35%). We continue to experience increased interest in our cloud solutions for law\nenforcement primarily due to the deployment of our cloud-based EVO-HD in-car system and our next generation body-worn camera\nproducts, which contributed to our increased cloud revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect this trend to continue for\n2024 as the migration from local storage to cloud storage continues in our customer base.\n● Video solutions operating segment revenues from extended warranty services were $860,337 and $692,017 for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $168,320 (24%). This correlates with consistent sales of hardware and additional\nextended warranties sold during the year.\n● Our entertainment operating segment generated service revenues totaling $9,018,805 and $15,272,697 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $6,253,892 (41%). The Company completed the acquisitions of Goody Tickets, LLC and\nTicketSmarter, LLC in the third quarter of 2021, thus resulting in the new revenue stream for the Company during the last fourth months\nof 2021 and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. TicketSmarter collects fees on transactions administered through the\nTicketSmarter.com platform for the buying and selling of tickets for live events throughout the country. We expect our entertainment\noperating segment to continue to fluctuate as we look right-size this segment and work towards profitability.\n● Our revenue cycle management operating segment generated service revenues totaling $6,713,678 and $7,886,107 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,172,429 (15%). Our revenue cycle management operating segment has\ncompleted four acquisitions since formation in June 2021, thus resulting in the new service revenue stream added in the twelve months\nended December 31, 2022. Our revenue cycle management operating segment provides revenue cycle management solutions and back-\noffice services to healthcare organizations throughout the country. The decrease in revenue is due to refinement within one of the recent\nacquisitions, as they strive to maximize profitability rather than focus on top line revenue.\nTotal revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 were $28,248,344 and $37,009,895, respectively, a decrease of $8,761,551\n(24%), due to the reasons noted above.\n21\nCost of Product Revenue\nOverall cost of product revenue sold for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 was $9,974,890 and $14,372,115, respectively, a decrease\nof $4,397,225 (31%). Overall cost of goods sold for products as a percentage of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 were\n107% and 131%, respectively. Cost of products sold by operating segment is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCost of Product Revenues:\nVideo Solutions $ 4,824,967 $ 8,332,484\nRevenue Cycle Management — —\nEntertainment 5,149,923 6,039,631\nTotal Cost of Product Revenues $ 9,974,890 $ 14,372,115\nThe decrease in cost of goods sold for our video solutions segment products is due to numerous factors including a sizeable increase in the\nallowance for excess and obsolete inventory in 2022, mostly surrounding the personal protective equipment product line. Cost of product sold as a\npercentage of product revenues for the video solutions segment decreased to 112% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 154% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease in entertainment operating segment cost of product sold directly correlates to the lower product revenues for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Cost of Product Revenues were $5,149,923 and $6,039,631 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a decrease of $889,708\n(15%). Cost of product sold as a percentage of product revenues for the entertainment segment decreased to 102% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to 108% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe recorded $4,542,461 and $5,489,541 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $3,044,653 and $4,509,165 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a\ndecrease of $1,464,512 (32%). Finished goods balances were $5,322,693 and $7,816,618 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively, a decrease of $2,493,925 (32%) which was attributable to a reduction in inventory for the video solutions product lines and a large decrease in\nticket inventory for the newly acquired entertainment segment. The decrease in the inventory reserve is primarily due to the disposal of obsolete inventory\nthat was included in the reserves during 2022. Additionally, the Company determined a reasonable reserve for inventory held at the ticket operating\nsegment, in which some inventory items sell below cost or go unsold, thus having to be fully written-off following the event date. We believe the reserves\nare appropriate given our inventory levels as of December 31, 2023.\nCost of Service Revenue\nOverall cost of service revenue sold for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 was $12,510,970 and $20,315,839, respectively, a decrease\nof $7,804,869 (38%). Overall cost of goods sold for services as a percentage of service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 were\n66% and 78%, respectively.

Cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues for the video solutions\nsegment increased to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease in revenue cycle management operating segment cost of service revenue is commensurate with the decline in revenues due certain\nloss generating services being eliminated during the year. Cost of service revenues as a percentage of product revenues for the revenue cycle management\noperating segment increased to 59% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 58% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease in entertainment operating segment cost of service revenues is due to management right sizing the business working towards\nprofitability. The Entertainment cost of service revenue was $7,213,754 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $14,563,128 for the year\nended December 31, 2022.

This is primarily driven by large inventory reserve being established in 2022, a focus on right sizing recent acquisitions\nto increase profitability and a transition to a service subscription-based model in our video solutions segment. Our goal is to improve our margins over the\nlonger term based on the expected margins generated by our new recent revenue cycle management and entertainment operating segments together with\nour video solutions operating segment and its expected margins from our EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, ShieldTM disinfectants and\nour cloud evidence storage and management offering, provided that they gain traction in the marketplace. We plan to continue our initiative to more\nefficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOverall selling, general and administrative expenses were $28,003,037 and $32,055,199 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, a decrease of $4,052,162 (13%).

Our research and development expenses totaled $2,618,746 and $2,290,293 for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $328,453 (14%). We employed 21 engineers at December 31, 2023 compared to 21 engineers at December\n31, 2022. Most of our engineers are dedicated to research and development activities for new products, primarily the new generation of body-worn\ncameras, EVO-HD and EVO Fleet that can be located in multiple places in a vehicle. We expect our research and development activities will continue to\ntrend higher in future quarters as we continue to expand our product offerings based on our new body-worn camera and EVO-HD product platform and as\nwe outsource more development projects. We consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and\nwill continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis and consistent with our financial resources.\nSelling, advertising and promotional expenses.

The overall decrease is primarily attributable to TicketSmarter’s very active approach to\nsponsorship and advertising in 2022 as they were aggressively building a brand and gaining recognition. TicketSmarter accounted for $2,328,759 and\n$4,024,748 of the total promotional and advertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $18,246,762 and $20,452,702 for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Such short-term investments are included in cash and cash equivalents as they contain original maturities of ninety (90) days or less.\nThe decrease reflects our overall lower cash and cash equivalent levels in 2023 compared to 2022.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Derivative Liabilities\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued detachable warrants to purchase a total of 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock in\nassociation with the two secured convertible notes previously described. The underlying warrant agreement terms provide for net cash settlement outside\nthe control of the Company in the event of tender offers under certain circumstances. As such, the Company is required to treat these warrants as derivative\nliabilities which are valued at their estimated fair value at their issuance date and at each reporting date with any subsequent changes reported in the\nconsolidated statement of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities. The change in fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities\nduring year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $1,846,642, compared to $6,726,638 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was recognized as a gain\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Promissory Notes and Earn-Out Agreements\nOn June 30, 2021, Nobility Healthcare, a subsidiary of the Company, issued a contingent consideration promissory note (the “June Contingent\nNote”) in connection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “June Seller”) of $350,000. Principal\npayments, since its inception, on this contingent consideration promissory note totaled $232,134.

This reduction only relates to the principal payments made for the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, the Company recorded a gain of $-0-\nand $27,139 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOn August 31, 2021, Nobility Healthcare, issued another contingent consideration promissory note (the “August Contingent Payment Note”) in\nconnection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “August Sellers”) of $650,000.

This gain\nrelates to the TicketSmarter Related Party Note payable for the entertainment segment, as a trust, the beneficiaries of which are TicketSmarter’s Chief\nExecutive Officer and his spouse, contributed cash in the amount of $2,700,000 to TicketSmarter. Those funds were then utilized to resolve numerous\noutstanding payables at a discounted rate, the discount received is recognized as a gain on extinguishment of liabilities on the statement of operations.\nAdditionally, these negotiations relieved TicketSmarter of numerous future obligations following fiscal year 2023, which will result in much more\nsignificant savings over the next several years.\nOther income\nOther income increased to $144,735 for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $-0- during the year ended December 31, 2022, which largely\nreflects income related to a warehouse lease within the corporate headquarters.\nOther expense\nOther expense was $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease from $230,744 during the year ended December 31, 2022, which\nreflects expense related to a note receivable adjustment.\nIncome/(Loss) before Income Tax Benefit\nAs a result of the above, we reported a net income/(loss) before income tax benefit of ($25,463,949) and ($18,873,758) for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decline of $6,590,191 (35%).\n26\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $-0- for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for both 2023 and\n2022 varied from the expected statutory rate due to our continuing to provide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. We determined that it\nwas appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily because of the recurring\noperating losses.\nWe have further determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023. During 2023,\nwe decreased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by $7,870,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent\noperating losses.\nWe had approximately $145,035,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $1,795,000 of research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards as of December 31, 2023 available to offset future net taxable income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above, we reported a net income/(loss) of ($25,463,949) and ($18,873,758) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, a decline of $6,590,191 (35%).\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests of Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe Company owns a 51% equity interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Nobility Healthcare. As a result, the noncontrolling shareholders or\nminority interest is allocated 49% of the income/loss of Nobility Healthcare which is reflected in the statement of income (loss) as “net income (loss)\nattributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiary”. We reported net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated\nsubsidiary of $224,598 and $407,933 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoss on Redemption – Series A & B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company redeemed 1,400,000 shares of Series A & 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock,\nfor a redemption price of $15,750,000, with a $13,365,000 carrying amount, resulting in a $2,385,000 loss on redemption.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nAs a result of the above, we reported a net loss of $25,688,547 and $21,666,691 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a\ndecline of $4,021,856 (19%).\nBasic and Diluted Income/(Loss) per Share\nThe basic and diluted income/(loss) per share was ($9.22) and ($8.50) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the\nreasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options and common stock purchase warrants were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 because all potentially dilutive securities during 2023 had exercise\nprices in excess of the market value of the company’s common stock and because of the net loss reported for 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverall:\nManagement’s Liquidity Plan - We have experienced net losses and cash outflows from operating activities since inception. Based upon our\ncurrent operating forecast, we anticipate that we will need to restore positive operating cash flows and/or raise additional capital in the short-term to fund\noperations, meet our customary payment obligations and otherwise execute our business plan over the next 12 months. We are continuously in discussions\nto raise additional capital, which may include a variety of equity and debt instruments; however, there can be no assurance that our capital raising initiatives\nwill be successful. Our recurring losses and level of cash used in operations, along with uncertainties concerning our ability to raise additional capital, raise\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n27\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain our listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and\nother continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum\nstockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with\nthe applicable listing standards. See “Nasdaq Listing” below.\nWe had $778,149 of available cash, equivalents and restricted cash and net negative working capital of $6,963,943 as of December 31, 2023. Net\nworking capital as of December 31, 2023, included approximately $4.7 million of accounts receivable and other receivables and $3.8 million of current\ninventory.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash: As of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash with an aggregate\nbalance of $778,149, a decrease from a balance of $3,532,199 for the year December 31, 2022.

The improvement in cash used in investing activities was due to several large investing activities in 2022\nincluding cost for the purchase of an aircraft for our BirdVu Jets subsidiary and the closing of one business\nacquisition and one asset acquisition that did not recur in 2023.\n● Financing activities: $7,380,494 of net cash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $7,380,494\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash used in financing activities of $6,954,617 for the year\nended December 31, 2022. In 2023, we completed a convertible note agreement, a related party note payable, a\nrevolving loan agreement and a merchant advance for our video solution segment, received a Commercial\nExtension of Credit for our Entertainment Segment, receiving net proceeds of $12.5 million.

In 2022, we utilized over $4.0\nmillion on the stock repurchase program, $2.4 million for completion of the preferred stock transaction, as well\nas over $0.5 million on payments of contingent consideration promissory notes related to the revenue cycle\nmanagement segment.\n28\nThe net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of $2,754,050 to $778,149 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCommitments:\nWe had $778,149 of cash, and cash equivalents, including restricted cash of $97,600 and net negative working capital $6,963,943 as of December\n31, 2023. Accounts receivable and other receivable balances represented $4,692,296 of our net working capital as of December 31, 2023. We intend to\ncollect our outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level during 2024, which would help to provide positive cash flow to support\nour operations during 2024. Inventory represented $3,845,281 of our net working capital as of December 31, 2023. We are actively managing the level of\ninventory and our goal is to reduce such level during 2024 by our sales activities, the increase of which should provide additional cash flow to help support\nour operations during 2024.\nCapital Expenditures.

As of commencement date, the operating lease\nliabilities reflect a weighted average discount rate of 8%.\nThe following sets forth the operating lease right of use assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023:\nAssets:\nOperating lease right of use assets $ 1,053,159\nLiabilities:\nOperating lease obligations-current portion $ 279,538\nOperating lease obligations-less current portion $ 827,836\nTotal operating lease obligations $ 1,107,374\nFollowing are the minimum lease payments for each year and in total.\nYear ending December 31:\n2024 $ 358,424\n2025 311,849\n2026 293,300\n2027 117,492\nThereafter 235,020\nTotal undiscounted minimum future lease payments 1,316,085\nImputed interest (208,711)\nTotal operating lease liability $ 1,107,374\n30\nDebt obligations is comprised of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nEconomic injury disaster loan (EIDL) $ 147,781 $ 150,000\nContingent consideration promissory note – Nobility Healthcare Division\nAcquisition 129,651 388,955\nContingent consideration promissory note – Nobility Healthcare Division\nAcquisition 58,819 176,456\nContingent consideration promissory note – Nobility Healthcare Division\nAcquisition — 208,083\nContingent consideration promissory note – Nobility Healthcare Division\nAcquisition — 4,346\nRevolving Loan Agreement 4,880,000 —\nCommercial Extension of Credit – Entertainment Segment 87,928 —\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (540,429) —\nMerchant Advances 1,350,000 —\nDebt obligations 6,113,750 927,840\nLess: current maturities of debt obligations 1,260,513 485,373\nDebt obligations, long-term $ 4,853,237 $ 442,467\nDebt obligations mature as follows as of December 31, 2023:\nDecember 31,\n2023\n2024 $ 1,260,513\n2025 4,712,154\n2026 3,542\n2027 3,677\n2028 and thereafter 133,864\nTotal $ 6,113,750\nLitigation.\nFrom time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose the\nspecifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and assuming\nwe determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against us. We record a\nliability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not probable, we determine whether\nit is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for\naccrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and\ncircumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We re-evaluate and update\naccruals as matters progress over time.\nWhile the ultimate resolution is unknown, we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect\nto our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance\nthat any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in\nexcess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or\ncash flows. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our litigation.\n31\n401 (k) Plan. The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan, as amended, requires the\nCompany to provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching\ncontributions for employee’s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company made matching contributions totaling $207,463 and\n$223,084 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and employer matching\ncontributions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our\nconsolidated financial statements. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and\nestimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially involve the most subjective judgments\nin their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions:\n● Revenue Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts;\n● Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory;\n● Goodwill and other intangible assets;\n● Warranty Reserves;\n● Stock-based Compensation Expense;\n● Fair value of warrants;\n● Fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations;\n● Accounting for Income Taxes; and\n● Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nRevenue Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all\nfive of the following conditions are met:\n(i) Identify the contract with the customer;\n(ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n(iii) Determine the transaction price;\n(iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n(v) Recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe consider the terms and conditions of the contract and our customary business practices in identifying our contracts under ASC 606. We\ndetermine we have a contract when the customer order is approved, we can identify each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred, we can\nidentify the payment terms for the services, we have determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance.\nAt contract inception we evaluate whether the contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s\nability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer,\ncredit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n32\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services and the products that will be transferred to the customer that\nare both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily\navailable from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately\nidentifiable from other promises in the contract. Our performance obligations consist of (i) products, (ii) professional services, and (iii) extended\nwarranties.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the\ncustomer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative\nrevenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts\nthat contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone\nselling price (“SSP”).\nRevenue for our video solutions segment is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the\npromised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the service is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive in exchange for our services. We generate all our revenue from contracts with customers.\nRevenue for our revenue cycle management segment is recorded on a net basis, as its primary source of revenue is its end-to-end service fees.\nThese service fees are reported as revenue monthly upon completion of our performance obligation to provide the agreed upon services.\nRevenue for our entertainment segment is recorded on a gross or net basis based on management’s assessment of whether we are acting as a\nprincipal or agent in the transaction. The determination is based upon the evaluation of control over the event ticket, including the right to sell the ticket,\nprior to its transfer to the ticket buyer.\nWe sell our tickets held in inventory, which consists of one performance obligation, being to transfer control of an event ticket to the buyer upon\nconfirmation of the order. We act as the principal in these transactions as we own the ticket at the time of sale, therefore we control the ticket prior to\ntransferring to the customer. In these transactions, revenue is recorded on a gross basis based on the value of the ticket and is recognized when an order is\nconfirmed. Payment is typically due upon delivery of the ticket.\nWe also act as an intermediary between buyers and sellers through the online secondary marketplace. Revenues derived from this marketplace\nprimarily consist of service fees from entertainment operations, and consists of one primary performance obligation, which is facilitating the transaction\nbetween the buyer and seller, being satisfied at the time the order has been confirmed. As we do not control the ticket prior to the transfer, we act as an\nagent in these transactions. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, net of the amount due to the seller when an order is confirmed, the seller is then obligated\nto deliver the tickets to the buyer per the seller’s listing. Payment is due at the time of sale.\nWe review all significant, unusual, or nonstandard shipments of products or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial\nreporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products, and when a customer purchases\nan extended warranty, the associated proceeds are treated as contract liability and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.\nFor our video solutions segment, our principal customers are state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low\nrisks for uncollectible accounts. However, we have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts\nthan such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. As of December 31, 2023,\nour historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $323,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $284.8 million since we\ncommenced deliveries in 2006.\n33\nFor our entertainment segment, our customers are mainly online visitors that pay at the time of the transaction, and we collect the service fees\ncharged with the transaction. Thus, leading to minimal risk for uncollectible accounts, to which we then consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on\ntheir individual circumstances. As we continue to learn more about the collectability related to this recent acquisition, we will track historical bad debts and\ncontinue to assess appropriate reserves.\nFor our revenue cycle management segment, our customers are mainly medium to large healthcare organizations that are charged monthly upon\nthe execution of our services. Being these customers are healthcare organizations with minimal risk for uncollectible accounts, we consider a specific\nreserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. As we continue to learn more about the collectability related to this recently added segment,\nwe will track historical bad debts and continue to assess appropriate reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $200,668 and $152,736, respectively.\nWe periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectability. Based on such\nreview, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of December 31, 2023. However, should the balance due from any significant\ncustomer ultimately become uncollectible then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge-off and we will be required to record\nadditional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.\nAllowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items.\nThe amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future\ndemand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess\nand obsolescence. Management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis. In addition, we adjust the carrying value of\ninventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.\nInventories consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRaw material and component parts $ 3,044,653 $ 4,509,165\nWork-in-process 20,396 3,164\nFinished goods – video solutions 4,623,489 6,846,091\nFinished goods – entertainment 699,204 970,527\nSubtotal 8,387,742 12,328,947\nReserve for excess and obsolete inventory – video solutions (4,355,666) (5,230,261)\nReserve for excess and obsolete inventory – entertainment (186,795) (259,280)\nTotal inventories $ 3,845,281 $ 6,839,406\nWe balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of\ninventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves represented 54.2% of the gross\ninventory balance as of December 31, 2023, compared to 44.5% of the gross inventory balance as of December 31, 2022. We had $4,542,461 and\n$5,489,541in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total raw materials and work-in-process was\n$3,065,049 and $4,512,329 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,447,280 (32%). Finished goods balances were $5,322,693\nand $7,816,618 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $2,493,925 (32%). The decrease in finished goods was primarily attributable\nto declining inventory for the new Shield product line, our new body-worn cameras and docking stations, along with a decline in inventory from our\nentertainment segment, acquired in September 2021. The decrease in the inventory reserve is primarily due to disposal of obsolete inventory previously\nreserved.\n34\nIf actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our\nproducts that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already\nestablished.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. When we acquire a business, we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on\nthe date of acquisition, which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships, software and content, as well as\ngoodwill. When determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, we consider, among other factors, analyses of historical financial performance\nand an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an\nincome approach that relies on discounted cash flows. This method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows for the asset and then adjusts\nthe forecast to present value by applying a discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. We consider this approach to be\nthe most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of an acquired intangible asset is its ability to generate future income. In a typical\nacquisition, we engage a third-party valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment. We select reasonable estimates and\nassumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, including, but not limited to, marketplace participants, consumer awareness and brand history.\nAdditionally, there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the\nselection of discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges. Specifically, the selected discount rates are intended to reflect\nthe risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets.\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset’s useful life also requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including,\nbut not limited to, the expected use of the asset, historical client retention rates, consumer awareness and trade name history, as well as any contractual\nprovisions that could limit or extend an asset’s useful life.\nThe Company’s goodwill is evaluated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least\nannually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment\nevaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that\ncould trigger an impairment review are current operating results that do not align with our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic\nplans or the use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy\nor in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nWhen performing our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any\nevents or circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the\nrelated carrying amount. If we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the related carrying\namount, then no quantitative impairment test is performed. However, if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount, then we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.\nEvaluating the recoverability of goodwill requires judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision\nand reliability of our estimates are subject to uncertainty. Among the factors that we consider in our qualitative assessment are general economic conditions\nand the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market\nassessments. To determine the fair values of our reporting units for a quantitative analysis, we typically utilize detailed financial projections, which include\nsignificant variables, such as projected rates of revenue growth, profitability and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the\nCompany’s weighted average cost of capital and other data.\n35\nOur most recent annual impairment test of goodwill conducted as of December 31, 2023, indicated no impairment. Subsequent to completing our\n2023 annual impairment test, no events or changes in circumstances were noted that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Note 1 — Nature of\nBusiness and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements provide additional information regarding the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWarranty Reserves. We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor standard warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions for\nestimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the\nnature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims. Our\nwarranty reserves were increased to $17,699 as of December 31, 2023 compared to $15,964 as of December 31, 2022 as we begin to slow our warranty\nexposures through the roll-off of DVM-750 and DVM-800 units from warranty coverage. Standard warranty exposure on the DVM-800 and DVM-250plus\nare the responsibility of the contract manufacturers, which reduced our overall warranty exposure as these are very popular products in our line. There is a\nrisk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products on our\nnew products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in\nfuture periods.\nStock-based Compensation Expense. We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based payment\nawards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. Our expected stock-price\nvolatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock that are obtained from public data sources and there were no stock options\ngranted during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIf factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ\nsignificantly from what we have recorded in the current period. There is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to\nestimate share-based compensation. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of the fair value of our share-based\ncompensation. Certain share-based payment awards, such as employee stock options, may expire worthlessly or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value\ncompared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, values may be realized from these\ninstruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Although the\nfair value of employee share-based awards is determined using an established option pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value\nobserved in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. In addition, we account for forfeitures as they occur.\nWarrant derivative liabilities. On April 5, 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock. The\nwarrant terms provide for net cash settlement outside the control of the Company under certain circumstances in the event of tender offers. As such, the\nCompany is required to treat these warrants as derivative liabilities which are valued at their estimated fair value at their issuance date and at each reporting\ndate with any subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities.\nThe Company has utilized the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the estimated fair value of the\nwarrant derivative liabilities as of their date of issuance and as of December 31, 2023:\nIssuance date December 31, 2023\nassumptions assumptions\nVolatility - range 106.0% 105.4%\nRisk-free rate 3.36% 3.84%\nDividend 0% 0%\nRemaining contractual term 5.0 years 4.3 years\nExercise price $ 5.50 - 7.50 $ 5.50 - 7.50\nCommon stock issuable under the warrants 1,125,000 1,125,000\n36\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management. Such\nestimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the\nfuture, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and\nthe likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative guidance also requires\nthat deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be\nrealized. As of December 31, 2023, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $42,070,000 were recorded in connection with the net deferred\nincome tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined that our valuation allowance should be\nincreased by $7,870,000 to a balance of $42,070,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023. We determined that it was appropriate\nto continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because of the overall net operating loss\ncarryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that\ndemonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based\nupon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax\nbenefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders’ equity.\nAs required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with\nrecognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return or\nplanned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. We have no\nrecorded liability as of December 31, 2023, representing uncertain tax positions.\nWe have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for\nstock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets, we must\ngenerate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases where deferred taxes were\nthe result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share\nprice increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised. In assessing whether a\nvaluation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in\nfuture periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset\nbalances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since\nwe will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be\nrequired to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.\n37\nRedeemable Preferred Stock. Preferred stock may be classified as a liability, temporary equity (i.e., mezzanine equity) or permanent equity. In\norder to determine the appropriate classification, an evaluation of the cash redemption features is required. Where there exists an absolute right of\nredemption presently or in the future, the preferred stock would be classified as a liability. If redemption is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of\nan event that is outside of the issuer’s control, it should be classified as mezzanine equity. The probability that the redemption event will occur is irrelevant.\nIf no redemption features exist, or if a contingent redemption feature is within the Company’s control, the preferred stock would be considered equity.\nInflation and Seasonality\nInflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year; however, we believe that it is likely to have significant impact to all of our\noperating segments in 2024 and beyond. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however, we generally generate higher revenues during\nthe second half of the calendar year compared to the first half.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur financial statements are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K commencing on page F-1.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving the control objectives, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2023, the\nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and was accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n38\n● Provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of our management and directors; and\n● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by 2013 Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment using the framework in 2013\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework, management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nMaterial Weakness\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we identified a material weakness in our\ninternal control over financial reporting related to timely review and detection of potential accounting misstatements, which in the aggregate, constitute a\nmaterial weakness.\nRemediation Activities\nAs part of our plan to remediate this material weakness, we are performing a full review of our internal control procedures. We have implemented,\nand plan to continue to implement, new controls and new processes. We have hired and plan to continue to hire additional qualified personnel and establish\nmore robust processes to support our internal control over financial reporting, including clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The Company anticipates\ntime being required to complete the implementation and to assess and ensure the sustainability of these controls. The material weakness will not be\nconsidered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have completed the process of integrating our recent business acquisition, which was acquired at the beginning of 2022, into our overall\ninternal control over the financial reporting process. Other than this integration, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing our internal controls to ensure the appropriate design and operating effectiveness.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nNone of the Company’s directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\nduring the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\n39\nPART III\nItem 10.

Officers are elected annually and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There is no family relationship between any of our directors,\ndirector nominees and executive officers. Board vacancies are filled by a majority vote of the Board.\n40\nBoard of Directors and Committee Meetings\nOur Board of Directors held four meetings and acted a number of times by unanimous consent resolutions during the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which he was appointed and served\nin the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Our directors are expected, absent exceptional circumstances, to attend all Board meetings and meetings of\ncommittees on which they serve and are also expected to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. All directors then in office attended the 2023 annual\nmeeting of stockholders.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur Board of Directors currently has three committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee. Each\ncommittee has a written charter approved by the Board of Directors outlining the principal responsibilities of the committee. These charters are also\navailable on the Investor Relations page of our website. All of our directors, other than our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have met in executive\nsessions without management present on a regular basis in 2023 and year-to-date 2024.\nAudit Committee\nOur Audit Committee appoints the Company’s independent auditors, reviews audit reports and plans, accounting policies, financial statements,\ninternal controls, audit fees, and certain other expenses and oversees our accounting and financial reporting process. Specific responsibilities include\nselecting, hiring and terminating our independent auditors; evaluating the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditors;\napproving the audit and non-audit services to be performed by our auditors; reviewing the design, implementation, adequacy and effectiveness of our\ninternal controls and critical accounting policies; overseeing and monitoring the integrity of our financial statements and our compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements as they relate to financial statements or accounting matters; reviewing any earnings announcements and other public\nannouncements regarding our results of operations in conjunction with management and our public auditors; conferring with management and the\nindependent auditors regarding the effectiveness of internal controls, financial reporting processes and disclosure controls; consulting with management\nand the independent auditors regarding Company policies governing financial risk management; reviewing and discussing reports from the independent\nauditors on critical accounting policies used by the Company; establishing procedures, as required under applicable law, for the receipt, retention and\ntreatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential and\nanonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters; reviewing and approving related-person\ntransactions in accordance with the Company’s policies and procedures with respect to related-person transactions and applicable rules; reviewing the\nfinancial statements to be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K; discussing with management and the independent auditors the results of the annual\naudit and the results of quarterly reviews and any significant changes in our accounting principles; and preparing the report that the SEC requires in our\nannual proxy statement.\nThe Audit Committee is comprised of two Directors, each of whom is independent, as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq\nRule 5605(a)(2). The Audit Committee held four meetings during the year ended December 31, 2023. The members of our Audit Committee are D. Duke\nDaughtery (Chairman), and Leroy C. Richie. The Board of Directors determined that Mr. Daughtery qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as\ndefined under the applicable rules and listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations and is independent as noted above.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee to assure that such services do not impair the auditor’s independence from the Company.\nAccordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the “Policy”) that sets forth the procedures and the\nconditions pursuant to which services to be performed by the independent auditors are to be pre-approved. Pursuant to the Policy, certain services described\nin detail in the Policy may be pre-approved on an annual basis together with pre-approved maximum fee levels for such services. The services eligible for\nannual pre-approval consist of services that would be included under the categories of Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees and Tax Fees in the table, as well as\nservices for limited review of actuarial reports and calculations. If not pre-approved on an annual basis, proposed services must otherwise be separately\napproved prior to being performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, any services that receive annual pre-approval but\nexceed the pre-approved maximum fee level also will require separate approval by the Audit Committee prior to being performed. The Audit Committee\nmay delegate authority to pre-approve audit and non-audit services to any member of the Audit Committee but may not delegate such authority to\nmanagement.\n41\nCompensation Committee\nOur Compensation Committee assists our Board of Directors in determining the development plans and compensation of our officers, directors\nand employees. Specific responsibilities include approving the compensation and benefits of our executive officers; reviewing the performance objectives\nand actual performance of our officers; administering our stock option and other equity compensation plans; and reviewing and discussing with\nmanagement the compensation discussion and analysis that the SEC requires in our future Form 10-Ks and proxy statements.\nOur Compensation Committee is comprised of two Directors, whom the Board considers to be independent under the applicable rules and listing\nstandards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. The members of our Compensation Committee are Leroy C. Richie (Chairman) and D. Duke\nDaughtery. The Compensation Committee held two meetings and acted several times by unanimous written consent resolutions during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Mr. Ross, our Chief Executive Officer, does not participate in the determination of his own compensation or the compensation of\ndirectors. However, he makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the amount and form of the compensation of the other\nexecutive officers and key employees, and he often participates in the Compensation Committee’s deliberations about such persons’ compensation. Thomas\nJ. Heckman, our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), also assists the Compensation Committee in its deliberations regarding executive officer, director and\nemployee compensation. No other executive officers participate in the determination of the amount or the form of the compensation of executive officers or\ndirectors. The Compensation Committee does not utilize the services of an independent compensation consultant to assist in its oversight of executive and\ndirector compensation.\nNominating Committee\nOur Nominating Committee assists our Board of Directors by identifying and recommending individuals qualified to become members of our\nBoard of Directors, reviewing correspondence from our stockholders, and establishing, evaluating, and overseeing our corporate governance guidelines.\nSpecific responsibilities include the following: evaluating the composition, size and governance of our Board of Directors and its committees and making\nrecommendations regarding future planning and appointing directors to our committees; establishing a policy for considering stockholder nominees for\nelection to our Board of Directors; and evaluating and recommending candidates for election to our Board of Directors.\nOur Nominating Committee strives for a Board composed of individuals who bring a variety of complementary skills, expertise, or background and who, as\na group, will possess the appropriate skills and experience to oversee our business. The diversity of the members of the Board relates to the selection of its\nnominees. While the Committee considers diversity and variety of experiences and viewpoints to be important factors, it does not believe that a director\nnominee should be chosen or excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual orientation or identity. In selecting a\ndirector nominee for recommendation to our Board, our Nominating Committee focuses on skills, expertise or background that would complement the\nexisting members on the Board. Accordingly, although diversity may be a consideration in the Committee’s process, the Committee and the Board of\nDirectors do not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees.\nWhen the Nominating Committee has either identified a prospective nominee or determined that an additional or replacement director is required,\nthe Nominating Committee may take such measures as it considers appropriate in connection with its evaluation of a director candidate, including\ncandidate interviews, inquiry of the person or persons making the recommendation or nomination, engagement of an outside search firm to gather\nadditional information, or reliance on the knowledge of the members of the Board of Directors or management. In its evaluation of director candidates,\nincluding the members of the Board eligible for re-election, the Nominating Committee considers a number of factors, including: the current size and\ncomposition of the Board of Directors, the needs of the Board of Directors and the respective committees of the Board, and such factors as judgment,\nindependence, character and integrity, age, area of expertise, diversity of experience, length of service and potential conflicts of interest.\n42\nThe Nominating Committee of the Board selects director nominees and recommends them to the full Board of Directors. In relation to such\nnomination process, the Nominating Committee:\n● determines the criteria for the selection of prospective directors and committee members;\n● reviews the composition and size of the Board and its committees to ensure proper expertise and diversity among its members;\n● evaluates the performance and contributions of directors eligible for re-election;\n● determines the desired qualifications for individual directors and desired skills and characteristics for the Board;\n● identifies persons who can provide needed skills and characteristics;\n● screens possible candidates for Board membership;\n● reviews any potential conflicts of interests between such candidates and the Company’s interests; and\n● shares information concerning the candidates with the Board and solicits input from other directors.\nThe Nominating Committee has specified the following minimum qualifications that it believes must be met by a nominee for a position on the\nBoard: the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity; proven achievement and competence in the nominee’s field and the ability to exercise\nsound business judgment; skills that are complementary to those of the existing Board; the ability to assist and support management and make significant\ncontributions to our success; the ability to work well with the other directors; the extent of the person’s familiarity with the issues affecting our business; an\nunderstanding of the fiduciary responsibilities that are required of a member of the Board of Directors; and the commitment of time and energy necessary\nto diligently carry out those responsibilities. A candidate for director must agree to abide by our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\nAfter completing its evaluation, the Nominating Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board of Directors as to the persons who should\nbe nominated to the Board, and the Board of Directors determines the nominees after considering the recommendation and report of the Committee.\nOur Nominating Committee is comprised of two Directors, whom the Board considers to be independent under the applicable rules and listing\nstandards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. The Nominating Committee held one meeting during the year ended December 31, 2023. The members\nof our Nominating Committee are Leroy C. Richie (Chairman) and D. Duke Daughtery.\nBoard of Directors’ Role in the Oversight of Risk Management\nWe face a variety of risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks. In fulfilling its risk oversight role, our Board of Directors focuses on the\nadequacy of our risk management process and overall risk management system. Our Board of Directors believes that an effective risk management system\nwill (i) adequately identify the material risks that we face in a timely manner; (ii) implement appropriate risk management strategies that are responsive to\nour risk profile and specific material risk exposures; (iii) integrate consideration of risk and risk management into our business decision-making; and (iv)\ninclude policies and procedures that adequately transmit necessary information regarding material risks to senior executives and, as appropriate, to the\nBoard or relevant committee.\nThe Board of Directors has designated the Audit Committee to take the lead in overseeing risk management at the Board of Directors level.\nAccordingly, the Audit Committee schedules time for periodic review of risk management, in addition to its other duties. In this role, the Audit Committee\nreceives reports from management, independent registered public accounting firm, outside legal counsel, and other advisors, and strives to generate serious\nand thoughtful attention to our risk management process and system, the nature of the material risks we face, and the adequacy of our policies and\nprocedures designed to respond to and mitigate these risks.\n43\nAlthough the Board of Directors has assigned the primary risk oversight to the Audit Committee, it also periodically receives information about\nour risk management system and the most significant risks that we face. This is principally accomplished through Audit Committee reports to the Board of\nDirectors and summary versions of the briefings provided by management and advisors to the Audit Committee.\nIn addition to the formal compliance program, our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee encourage management to promote a corporate\nculture that understands risk management and incorporates it into our overall corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. Our risk management\nstructure also includes an ongoing effort to assess and analyze the most likely areas of future risk for us. As a result, the Board of Directors and the Audit\nCommittee periodically ask our executives to discuss the most likely sources of material future risks and how we are addressing any significant potential\nvulnerability.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board of Directors does not have a policy on whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be\nseparate and, if they are to be separate, whether the Chairman of the Board should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee. Our\nBoard of Directors believes that it should be free to make a choice from time to time in any manner that is in the best interest of us and our stockholders.\nThe Board of Directors believes that Mr. Ross’s service as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board is in the best interest of us and our\nstockholders. Mr. Ross possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges we face and is thus best positioned to develop\nagendas, with the input of Mr. Richie, the lead independent director, to ensure that the Board’s time and attention are focused on the most critical matters.\nHis combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and\nconsistently to our stockholders, employees, customers, and suppliers, particularly during times of turbulent economic and industry conditions.\nOur Board of Directors also believes that a lead independent director is part of an effective Board leadership structure. To this end, the Board has\nappointed Mr. Richie as the lead independent director. The independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions at which only they are present, and\nthe lead independent director chairs those sessions. As the lead independent director, Mr. Richie calls meetings of the independent directors as needed; sets\nthe agenda for meetings of the independent directors; presides at meetings of the independent directors; is the principal liaison on Board issues between the\nindependent directors and the Chairman and between the independent directors and management; provides feedback to the Chairman and management on\nthe quality, quantity and timeliness of information sent to the Board; is a member of the Compensation Committee that evaluates the CEO’s performance;\nand oversees the directors’ evaluation of the Board’s overall performance. The Nominating Committee and the Board believe that its leadership structure,\nwhich includes the appointment of a lead independent director, is appropriate because it, among other things, provides for an independent director who\ngives board member leadership and each of the directors, other than Mr. Ross, is independent. Our Board of Directors believes that independent directors\nprovide effective oversight of management.\nStockholder Communications with the Board of Directors\nStockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors by writing to us as follows: Digital Ally, Inc., attention: Corporate Secretary, 14001\nMarshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215.

The\npolicy of our Nominating Committee is to consider recommendations for candidates to the Board of Directors from any stockholder of record in accordance\nwith our Bylaws. A director candidate recommended by our stockholders will be considered in the same manner as a nominee recommended by a Board\nmember, management or other sources. In addition, a stockholder may nominate a person directly for election to the Board of Directors at an annual\nmeeting of stockholders, provided the stockholder meets the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. We do not pay a fee to any third party to identify or\nevaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominees.\nStockholder Recommendations for Director Nominations. Stockholder recommendations for director nominations may be submitted to the\nCompany at the following address: Digital Ally, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215. Such\nrecommendations will be forwarded to the Nominating Committee for consideration, provided that they are accompanied by sufficient information to\npermit the Board to evaluate the qualifications and experience of the nominees, and they are in time for the Nominating Committee to do an adequate\nevaluation of the candidate before the Annual Meeting. The submission must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if\nnominated by the Board of Directors and to serve if elected and to cooperate with a background check.\n44\nStockholder Nominations of Directors. Our Bylaws provide that, in order for a stockholder to nominate a director at an annual meeting of\nstockholders, the stockholder must give timely written notice to our Secretary and such notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less\nthan one-hundred-and-twenty (120) days before the date of our release of the proxy statement to stockholders in connection with our previous year’s annual\nmeeting of stockholders. Such stockholder’s notice shall include, with respect to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a\ndirector, all information relating to such nominee that is required under the Exchange Act, including such person’s written consent to being named in the\nproxy statement as a nominee and serving as a director, and cooperating with a background investigation. In addition, the stockholder must include in such\nnotice the name and address, as they appear on our records, of the stockholder proposing the nomination of such person, and the name and address of the\nbeneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, the class and number of shares of our capital stock that are owned beneficially and of\nrecord by such stockholder of record and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, and any material interest or relationship\nthat such stockholder of record and/or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made may respectively have in such business or with\nsuch nominee. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated for election as a director shall furnish to our Secretary the information\nrequired to be set forth in a stockholder’s notice of nomination that pertains to the nominee.\nTo be timely in the case of a special meeting or if the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than thirty (30) days from such anniversary\ndate, a stockholder’s notice must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the\nearlier of the day on which notice of the meeting date was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting date was made.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of our executive officers serves, or in the past has served, as a member of the Compensation Committee. None of the members of our\nCompensation Committee is, or has ever been, an officer or employee of the Company.\nCode of Ethics and Conduct\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct that is applicable to all of our employees, officers and directors. Our Code of\nEthics and Conduct is intended to ensure that our employees, officers and directors act in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

Our executive compensation plan is based on attracting and retaining qualified professionals who possess the skills and leadership\nnecessary to enable us to achieve earnings and profitability growth to satisfy its stockholders. We must, therefore, create incentives for these executives to\nachieve both our and individual performance objectives using performance-based compensation programs. No one component is considered by itself, but\nall forms of the compensation package are considered in total. Wherever possible, objective measurements will be utilized to quantify performance, but\nmany subjective factors still come into play when determining performance.\nCompensation Components. The main elements of its compensation package consist of base salary, stock options or restricted stock awards and bonus.\nBase Salary. The base salary for each executive officer is reviewed and compared to the prior year, with considerations given for increase or decrease. The\nreview is generally on an annual basis but may take place more often in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.\nOn January 7, 2022, the Compensation Committee restored the annual base salaries of Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer, Thomas J. Heckman,\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and Peng Han, Chief Operating Officer, at $300,000, $120,000, and $250,000, respectively for 2022.\nOn January 10, 2023, the Compensation Committee restored the annual base salaries of Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer, Thomas J. Heckman,\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and Peng Han, Chief Operating Officer, at $250,000, $120,000, and $250,000, respectively for 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee plans to review the base salaries for possible adjustments on an annual basis. Base salary adjustments will be based on both\nthe individual and our performances and will include both objective and subjective criteria specific to each executive’s role and responsibility with us.\nStock Options and Restricted Stock Awards. The Compensation Committee determined stock option and restricted stock awards based on numerous\nfactors, some of which include responsibilities incumbent with the role of each executive with us, tenure with us, as well as our performance. The vesting\nperiod of options and restricted stock is also tied, in some instances, to our performance directly related to certain executive’s responsibilities with us. The\nCompensation Committee determined that Messrs. Ross, Heckman, and Han were eligible for awards of stock options or restricted stock in 2022 based on\ntheir performance. Refer to the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” table below for restricted stock awards made in 2022. The Committee also determined that\nMessrs. Ross, Heckman, and Han would be eligible in 2023 for awards of restricted stock or stock options.\nBonuses. The Compensation Committee determined to award bonuses to each of the executive officers in 2023 and 2022, as set forth in the foregoing\ntable. Refer to the “Summary Compensation Table” above for the bonuses paid to Messrs. Ross, Heckman, and Han in 2023 and 2022. In fiscal 2023,\nMessrs. Ross, Heckman, and Han were eligible for bonuses of up to $250,000, $120,000, and $250,000, respectively.\nOther. In July 2008, we amended and restated our 401(k) Plan. The amended 401(k) Plan requires us to provide a 100% matching contribution for\nemployees who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and a 50% matching contribution for employees’ elective deferrals between\n4% and 5%. We have made matching contributions for executives who elected to contribute to the 401(k) Plan during 2021. Each participant is 100%\nvested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 66,946 shares of our Common Stock were held\nin the 401(k) Plan. Mr. Heckman, as trustee of the 401(k) Plan, holds the voting power as to the shares of our Common Stock held in the 401(k) Plan. We\nhave no profit-sharing plan in place for our employees. However, we may consider adding such a plan to provide yet another level of compensation to our\ncompensation plan.\n47\nThe following table presents information concerning the grants of plan-based awards to the Named Executive Officers during the year ended December 31,\n2023:\nGrant of Plan-Based Awards\nAll other\nstock\nawards:\nNumber Exercise or Grant date\nof shares of base fair\nDate stock price of value of\napproved by or units: option stock\nCompensation (#) (1) awards awards\nName Grant date Committee (2) ($/Share) ($) (3)\nStanton E.

However, on December 23, 2008, we entered into retention agreements\nwith the following executive officers: Stanton E. Ross and Thomas J. Heckman.

The amount to be recovered will be the excess of the incentive compensation paid to the Covered Executive based\non the erroneous data over the incentive compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as\ndetermined by the board. If the board cannot determine the amount of excess incentive compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the\ninformation in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\nRefer to Exhibit 97 of this Annual Report for the Company’s Clawback Policy.\nItem 12.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for each of the years\nin the two year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nfinancial statements, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses and will require additional capital to continue as a going concern. This raises\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the\namounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statement are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nNew York, NY Washington DC Mumbai & Pune, India Boca Raton, FL\nSan Francisco, CA Las Vegas, NV Beijing, China Athens, Greece\nMember: ANTEA International with affiliated offices worldwide\nF-2\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill, Indefinite Life Intangibles and Other Intangibles Impairment Assessments – Entertainment/Ticketing Reporting Unit – Refer to Notes\n1, 8 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset balance was $5,886,547 and\n$600,000, respectively as of December 31, 2023. The Company also has amortizable identifiable intangible assets of $5,600,000 and $600,000 which are\nbeing amortized over 5 years and 4 years, respectively, and are related to the Entertainment/Ticketing reporting unit. Management tests these assets\nannually for impairment or more frequently when potential impairment triggering events are present. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the\nestimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Management uses a market approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting unit. The key\nassumptions and estimates utilized in the market approach primarily include market multiples, peer group and comparable transaction selection and\nselection of relevant financial matrices for concluding the fair value of reporting unit, and future levels of revenue growth.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments of the\nEntertainment/Ticketing reporting unit is a critical audit matter because (i) the significant judgment used by management when determining the fair value\nestimates of the reporting units; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the significant\nassumptions used in management’s fair value estimates; and (iii) the audit effort involved in the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n● These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the fair value estimates of the entertainment/ticketing\nreporting unit; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the market approach; and (iii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to market multiples, peer group and comparable transaction selection\nand selection of relevant financial matrices for concluding the fair value of reporting unit and future levels of revenue growth.\n● Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the future levels of revenue growth and involved evaluating whether the assumptions were\nreasonable considering (i) current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii)\nwhether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n● Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the market approach and (ii) the\nreasonableness of significant assumptions related to the market multiples, peer group and comparable transaction selection and selection of\nrelevant financial matrices for concluding the fair value of reporting unit and future levels of revenue growth.\n/s/ RBSM LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nNew

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Business:\nDigital Ally, Inc. was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. and had no operations until 2004. On\nNovember 30, 2004, Vegas Petra, Inc. entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., at which time the merged entity was renamed Digital Ally, Inc.\n(such merged entity, the “Predecessor Registrant”).\nOn August 23, 2022 (the “Effective Time”), the Predecessor Registrant merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, DGLY Subsidiary Inc.,\na Nevada corporation (the “Registrant”), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 23, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), between the\nPredecessor Registrant and the Registrant, with the Registrant as the surviving corporation in the merger (such transaction, the “Merger”). At the Effective\nTime, Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, pursuant to which the Registrant was renamed “Digital Ally, Inc.”\nand, by operation of law, succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor Registrant immediately\nprior to the Merger. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, shareholder approval was not required in connection with the Merger Agreement or the\ntransactions contemplated thereby.\nAt the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) each outstanding share of Predecessor Registrant’s common stock, par value $0.001\nper share (the “Predecessor Common Stock”) automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Registrant\n(“Registrant Common Stock”), (ii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of Predecessor Common Stock converted into an option,\nright or warrant, as applicable, to acquire an equal number of shares of Registrant Common Stock under the same terms and conditions as the original\noptions, rights or warrants, and (iii) the directors and executive officers of the Predecessor Registrant were appointed as directors and executive officers, as\napplicable, of the Registrant, each to serve in the same capacity and for the same term as such person served with the Predecessor Registrant immediately\nbefore the Merger.\nThe business of the Registrant, Digital Ally, Inc. (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC,\nDigital Ally Healthcare, LLC (“Digital Ally Healthcare”), TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”), Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc.,\nBirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc. (“Kustom 440”), Kustom Entertainment, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC,\ncollectively, “Digital Ally,” “Digital,” and the “Company”), is divided into three reportable operating segments: 1) the Video Solutions Segment, 2) the\nRevenue Cycle Management Segment and 3) the Ticketing Segment. The Video Solutions Segment is our legacy business that produces digital video\nimaging, storage products, disinfectant and related safety products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. This segment includes\nboth service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety\nsolutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout\nthe country, as a monthly service fee. The Ticketing Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing\nplatform, ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The accounting guidance on Segment\nReporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of\nthose segments to be presented in financial statements. Such required segment information is included in Note 23.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of\nthe State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the shares of its common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was\neffective as of time of filing. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that\nwould have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the\nboard of directors of the Company approved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable\ninto shares of the Company’s common stock, including, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. All\nhistorical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout the Company’s consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Report\nhave been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split as if the split occurred as of the earliest period presented. The par value per share of the Company’s\ncommon stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.\nF-8\nBusiness Combination\nIn June 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., a Delaware\ncorporation (Nasdaq: CLOE) (“Clover Leaf”), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (“Merger Sub”),\nYntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined\nin the Merger Agreement) for the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and Kustom\nEntertainment, Inc., a Nevada corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and\nentertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies (“Kustom”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and\nconditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge\nwith and into Kustom, with Kustom continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing\nwhich is subject to the approval of Clover Leaf’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions, the common\nstock of the combined company is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name “Kustom\nEntertainment”.\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s Significant Accounting Policies:\nBasis of Consolidation:\nThe accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Digital Ally, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally\nInternational, Inc., Shield Products, LLC, Digital Ally Healthcare, LLC, TicketSmarter, Inc., Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc., BirdVu\nJets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated\nduring consolidation.\nThe Company formed Digital Ally International, Inc. during August 2009 to facilitate the export sales of its products. The Company formed\nShield Products, LLC in May 2020 to facilitate the sales of its Shield™ line of disinfectant/cleanser products and ThermoVu® line of temperature\nmonitoring equipment. The Company formed Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”) in June 2021 to facilitate the operations of its revenue\ncycle management solutions and back-office services for healthcare organizations. The Company formed TicketSmarter, Inc. upon its acquisition of Goody\nTickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, to facilitate its global ticketing operations. The Company formed Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd., which is a captive\ninsurance company domiciled in Bermuda. It will provide primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently\navailable or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace. The Company formed Digital Connect, Inc. and BirdVu Jets, Inc. for travel and\ntransportation purposes in 2022. The Company formed Kustom 440, Inc. in 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences directly for consumers, and\nKustom Entertainment, Inc. in 2023 to serve as the participant in the Business Combination.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and subordinated notes\npayable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all\nrelated appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to its customers in an amount\nreflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach:\n(1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company has two different revenue streams, product and service, represented through its three segments. The Company reports all revenues\non a gross basis, other than service revenues from the Company’s entertainment and revenue cycle management segments, Revenues generated by all\nsegments are reported net of sales taxes.\nF-9\nVideo Solutions\nThe Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the\ncustomer. In situation where sales are to a distributor, the Company had concluded its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract\nbearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of part of its consideration for the contract, the Company evaluates certain\nfactors including the customers’ ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is\ndistinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or\nadjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, it has\nelected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the\ntransaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered\nthe standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is\nrecognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e. when the Company’s performance obligations is satisfied), which typically\noccurs at shipment. Further in determining whether control has been transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal\ntitle, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer. Customers do not have a right to return the product other than for\nwarranty reasons for which they would only receive repair services or replacement products. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under\nASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions for product sales when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have\notherwise recognized is less than one year.\nService and other revenue is comprised of revenues from extended warranties, repair services, cloud revenue and software revenue. Revenue is\nrecognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer for repair services. Revenue for extended\nwarranty, cloud service or other software-based products is over the term of the contract warranty or service period. A time-elapsed method is used to\nmeasure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to these revenues\nis generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, as long as the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nThe Company’s multiple performance obligations may include future in-car or body-worn camera devices to be delivered at defined points within\na multi-year contract, and in those arrangements, the Company allocates total arrangement consideration over the life of the multi-year contract to future\ndeliverables using management’s best estimate of selling price.\nRevenue Cycle Management\nThe Company reports revenue cycle management revenues on a net basis, as its primary source of revenue is its end-to-end service fees which is\ngenerally determined as a percentage of the invoice amounts collected. These service fees are reported as revenue monthly upon completion of the\nCompany’s performance obligation to provide the agreed upon service.\nEntertainment\nThe Company reports ticketing revenue on a gross or net basis based on management’s assessment of whether the Company is acting as a\nprincipal or agent in the transaction. The determination is based upon the evaluation of control over the event ticket, including the right to sell the ticket,\nprior to its transfer to the ticket buyer.\nThe Company sells tickets held in inventory, which consists of one performance obligation, being to transfer control of an event ticket to the buyer\nupon confirmation of the order. The Company acts as the principal in these transactions as the ticket is owned by the Company at the time of sale, therefore\ncontrolling the ticket prior to transferring to the customer. In these transactions, revenue is recorded on a gross basis based on the value of the ticket and is\nrecognized when an order is confirmed. Payment is typically due upon delivery of the ticket.\nThe Company also acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers through online secondary marketplace. Revenues derived from this\nmarketplace primarily consist of service fees from ticketing operations, and consists of one primary performance obligation, which is facilitating the\ntransaction between the buyer and seller, being satisfied at the time the order has been confirmed. As the Company does not control the ticket prior to the\ntransfer, the Company acts as an agent in these transactions. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, net of the amount due to the seller when an order is\nconfirmed, the seller is then obligated to deliver the tickets to the buyer per the seller’s listing. Payment is due at the time of sale.\nF-10\nOther\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported\nseparately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid\ncloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $2.6 million related to its contract liabilities. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and\ninclude payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are\ngenerally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. Total contract liabilities consist of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023\nRecognized December 31,\nDecember 31, 2022 Additions/Reclass Revenue 2023\nContract liabilities, current $ 2,154,874 $ 2,538,187 $ 1,755,893 $ 2,937,168\nContract liabilities, non-current 5,818,082 2,328,994 806,617 7,340,459\n$ 7,972,956 $ 4,867,181 $ 2,562,510 $ 10,277,627\nDecember 31, 2022\nRecognized December 31,\nDecember 31, 2021 Additions/Reclass Revenue 2022\nContract liabilities, current $ 1,665,519 $ 1,478,479 $ 989,124 $ 2,154,874\nContract liabilities, non-current 2,687,786 4,560,600 1,430,304 5,818,082\n$ 4,353,305 $ 6,039,079 $ 2,419,428 $ 7,972,956\nSales returns and allowances aggregated $117,713 and $118,026 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Obligations for\nestimated sales returns and allowances are recognized at the time of sales on an accrual basis. The accrual is determined based upon historical return rates\nadjusted for known changes in key variables affecting these return rates.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to, determining the estimated lives of long-lived\nassets, determining the potential impairment of long-lived assets, the fair value of warrants, options, the recognition of revenue, inventory valuation\nreserve, allowances for doubtful accounts and other receivables, incremental borrowing rate on leases, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and\nother legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the\nchanges become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are\ndetermined to be necessary.\nF-11\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash and cash equivalents include funds on hand, in bank and short-term investments with original maturities of ninety (90) days or less. The\nfollowing table shows the Company’s cash and cash equivalents by significant investment category as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023\nAdjusted Realized Realized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nDemand deposits $ 545,207 $ — $ — $ 545,207\nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90\ndays or less (Level 1):\nMoney market funds 135,342 — — 135,342\n$ 680,549 $ — $ — $ 680,549\nDecember 31, 2022\nAdjusted Realized Realized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\nDemand deposits $ 897,745 $ — $ — $ 897,745\nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90\ndays or less (Level 1):\nMoney market funds 2,634,454 — — 2,634,454\n$ 3,532,199 $ — $ — $ 3,532,199\nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accounts that at\ntimes may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with numerous\nmajor financial institutions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the uninsured balance amounted to $29,700 and $2,495,189, respectively.\nRestricted Cash:\nRestricted cash of $97,600 and $-0- was included in other assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Restricted cash consists of bank deposits\nthat collateralize our debt obligations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in\nthe consolidated statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 680,549 $ 3,532,199\nLong-term restricted cash included in other assets 97,600 —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statements of cash flows $ 778,149 $ 3,532,199\nAccounts Receivable:\nAccounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding\namounts on a weekly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and\nconsidering a customer’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions.\nTrade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. A\ntrade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than thirty (30) days beyond terms. No interest\nis charged on overdue trade receivables.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles:\nGoodwill - In connection with acquisitions, the Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition\nmethod of accounting. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31, and\nmore frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially\nrecorded. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within\na reporting unit, whether acquired or internally generated, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\nF-12\nTraditionally, goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to its carrying\namount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than zero and its fair value is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the\nreporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step two\ninvolves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-04 which simplifies subsequent goodwill measurement by\neliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As a result, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying\nvalue and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the reporting unit’s fair value.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the market approach. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value\nbased on multiples of comparable public companies and precedent transactions. Significant estimates in the market approach include: identifying similar\ncompanies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and\noperating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.\nLong-lived and Other Intangible Assets - The Company periodically assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets in accordance with the\nprovisions of ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company groups its assets at the lowest level for which\nidentifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities. The Company has determined that the lowest level for\nwhich identifiable cash flows are available is the operating segment level.\nFactors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating\nresults; significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic\ntrends. When the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of\nimpairment, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum\nof the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an\nimpairment loss. An impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, based on the\nfair value if available, or discounted cash flows, if fair value is not available. The Company assessed potential impairments of its long-lived assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment.\nLong-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived\nasset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset\ngroup to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment\nis recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including\ndiscounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as considered necessary.\nIntangible assets include deferred patent costs and license agreements and intangibles related to acquisitions. Legal expenses incurred in\npreparation of patent application have been deferred and will be amortized over the useful life of granted patents. Costs incurred in preparation of\napplications that are not granted will be charged to expense at that time. The Company has entered into several sublicense agreements under which it has\nbeen assigned the exclusive rights to certain licensed materials used in its products. These sublicense agreements generally require upfront payments to\nobtain the exclusive rights to such material. The Company capitalizes the upfront payments as intangible assets and amortizes such costs over their\nestimated useful life on a straight-line method.\nInventories:\nInventories for the video solutions segment consist of electronic parts, circuitry boards, camera parts and ancillary parts (collectively,\n“components”), work-in-process and finished goods. Finished goods that are manufactured and assembled by the Company are carried at the lower of cost\nor net realizable value, with cost determined by standard cost methods, which approximate the first-in, first-out method. Inventory costs include material,\nlabor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories for the entertainment segment consists of tickets to live events purchased, which are held at lower of cost or\nnet realizable value, and written-off after the event has occurred. Event tickets for the entertainment segment are carried at lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue, and fully written off at the time the event occurs if the ticket is unsold and remaining in inventory after the completion of the event. Management has\nestablished inventory reserves based on estimates of excess and/or obsolete current inventory.\nF-13\nManufacturing inventory for the video solutions segment is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis, based on\nestimated future use of quantities on hand, which is determined based on past usage, planned changes to products and known trends in markets and\ntechnology. Changes in support plans or technology could have a significant impact on obsolescence.\nTo support our world-wide service operations for the video solutions segment, we maintain service spare parts inventory, which consists of both\nconsumable and repairable spare parts. Consumable service spare parts are used within our service business to replace worn or damaged parts in a system\nduring a service call and are generally classified in current inventory as our stock of this inventory turns relatively quickly. However, if there has been no\nrecent usage for a consumable service spare part, but the part is still necessary to support systems under service contracts, the part is considered to be non-\ncurrent and included within non-current inventories within our consolidated balance sheet. Consumables are charged to cost of goods sold when issued\nduring the service call.\nAs these service parts age over the related product group’s post-production service life, we reduce the net carrying value of our repairable spare\npart inventory on the consolidated balance sheet to account for the excess that builds over the service life. The post-production service life of our systems is\ngenerally seven to twelve years and, at the end of twelve years, the carrying value for these parts in our consolidated balance sheet is reduced to zero. We\nalso perform periodic monitoring of our installed base for premature end of service life events and expense, through cost of sales, the remaining net\ncarrying value of any related spare parts inventory in the period incurred.\nProperty, plant and equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements are capitalized while ordinary\nmaintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life\nof the asset, which ranges from three to thirty years, other than the infinite useful life of land. Amortization expense on capitalized leases is included with\ndepreciation expense. The cost and accumulated depreciation related to assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is credited\nor charged to income.\nLeases:\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For arrangements where the Company is the lessee, the Company will\nevaluate whether to account for the lease as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are included in the right of use assets (ROU) and operating lease\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Finance leases would be included in property, plant and equipment, net and long-\nterm debt and finance lease obligations on the balance sheet. The Company had operating leases for copiers, offices and warehouse space at December 31,\n2023 but no financing leases.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the\noperating lease liabilities if the operating lease does not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include the option to extend when Company is\nreasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not\nrecognized for short term leases.\nWarranties:\nThe Company’s video solutions segment products carry explicit product warranties that extend up to two years from the date of shipment. The\nCompany records a provision for estimated warranty costs based upon historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to\nreflect actual experience. Accrued warranty costs are included in accrued expenses. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a\ncustomer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as contract liabilities and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.\nF-14\nShipping and Handling Costs:\nShipping and handling costs video solutions segment for outbound sales orders totaled $51,061 and $70,749 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdvertising Costs:\nAdvertising expense video solutions segment and entertainment segments includes costs related to trade shows and conventions, promotional\nmaterial and supplies, and media costs. Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The Company incurred total advertising\nexpenses of approximately $5,773,965 and $7,668,641 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such costs are included in selling,\nadvertising and promotional expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred taxes are provided for by the liability method in which deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the\ndifferences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the\nopinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nadjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe Company applies the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 740\n- Income Taxes that provides a framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and provided a comprehensive model to recognize, measure,\npresent, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. It initially recognizes tax positions in\nthe financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are\ninitially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the\ntax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Application requires numerous estimates based on available information. The\nCompany considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, and it recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not\naccurately anticipate actual outcomes. As it obtains additional information, the Company may need to periodically adjust its recognized tax positions and\ntax benefits. These periodic adjustments may have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. There was no interest expense related to the underpayment of estimated taxes during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022. There were no penalties in 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s tax returns filed for 2020,\n2021 and 2022 and to be filed for 2023 are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. With a few exceptions, as of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany is no longer subject to Federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for taxable years prior to 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses:\nThe Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred, which is generally incurred by the video solutions segment. Development\ncosts of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has\nbeen established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after\ntechnological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and software\ndevelopment costs were expensed as incurred during 2023 and 2022.\nF-15\nWarrant Derivative Liabilities:\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in an Entities Own Equity, entities must consider whether to classify\ncontracts that may be settled in its own stock, such as warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, as equity of the entity or as an asset or liability. If an\nevent that is not within the entity’s control could require net cash settlement, then the contract should be classified as an asset or a liability rather than as\nequity. We have determined because the terms of the warrants issued during the first quarter of 2021, and remain outstanding, include a provision that\nentitles all the warrant holders to receive cash for their warrants in the event of a qualifying cash tender offer, while only certain of the holders of the\nunderlying shares of common stock would be entitled to cash, our warrants should be classified as liability measured at fair value, with changes in fair\nvalue each period reported in earnings. Volatility in the price of our common stock may result in significant changes in the value of the derivatives and\nresulting gains and losses on our statement of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees, board of directors and certain third-party contractors. Share-based compensation\narrangements may include the issuance of options to purchase common stock in the future or the issuance of restricted stock, which generally are subject to\nvesting requirements. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation granted based on the grant-date fair\nvalue. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nThe Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Assumptions used to\nestimate compensation expense are determined as follows:\n● Expected term is determined using the contractual term and vesting period of the award;\n● Expected volatility of award grants made in the Company’s plan is measured using the weighted average of historical daily changes in the\nmarket price of the Company’s common stock over the period equal to the expected term of the award;\n● Expected dividend rate is determined based on expected dividends to be declared;\n● Risk-free interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity equal to the expected term\nof the awards; and\n● Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nSegment Reporting\nThe accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial\nstatements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Operating segments are identified as components of\nan enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer or “CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s three operating segments are\nVideo Solutions, Revenue Cycle Management, and Entertainment, each of which has specific personnel responsible for that business and reports to the\nCODM. Corporate expenses capture the Company’s corporate administrative activities, is also to be reported in the segment information. Therefore, its\noperations are eliminated in consolidation and is not considered a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes.\nF-16\nContingent Consideration\nIn circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the Company recognizes\na liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments the Company expects to make as of the acquisition date. The Company remeasures this liability\neach reporting period and records changes in the fair value through the consolidated statement of operations.\nRepurchase and Cancellation of Shares\nFrom time to time, the Board may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are held in\ntreasury for general corporate purposes and cancelled when it is determined appropriate by management. The Company accounts for repurchases of\ncommon stock under the cost method. Shares repurchased and cancelled during the period were recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. See further\ndiscussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 18–Stockholders’ Equity.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements represent the interest in subsidiaries held by venture partners. The\nventure partners hold noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. Since the Company consolidates the\nfinancial statements of all wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries, the noncontrolling owners’ share of each subsidiary’s results of operations are\ndeducted and reported as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRedeemable Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock may be classified as a liability, temporary equity (i.e., mezzanine equity) or permanent equity. In order to determine the\nappropriate classification, an evaluation of the cash redemption features is required. Where there exists an absolute right of redemption presently or in the\nfuture, the preferred stock would be classified as a liability. If redemption is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the\nissuer’s control, it should be classified as mezzanine equity. The probability that the redemption event will occur is irrelevant. If no redemption features\nexist, or if a contingent redemption feature is within the Company’s control, the preferred stock would be considered equity.\nLease Receivable\nLease receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less the total payments received pertaining to each individual customer’s lease\nagreement. These agreements range from three to five years and are removed from lease receivables upon termination of the agreement. The Company\ndetermines if an allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer lease receivables and considering a customer’s financial\ncondition, credit history, and current economic conditions. No allowance was deemed necessary for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNotes Receivable\nNotes receivable are carried at the original note amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding notes\non a quarterly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating each note receivable and considering the\nborrower’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. The Company entered into a promissory note, through its entertainment\nsegment, as part of a co-marketing agreement, with a principal amount of $3,000,000. Principal payment, since its inception, on this promissory note\ntotaled $2,849,846 as of December 31, 2023, resulting in a remaining balance of $150,154 maturing December 31, 2023.\nF-17\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial\nstatements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense\ncategories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate\nreconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3)\nincome tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their\nincome tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU\n2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting\nthis new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nGoing Concern Matters and Management’s Plans\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets\nand the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred substantial operating losses in the years ended December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 primarily due to reduced gross margins caused by a combination of competitors’ introduction of newer products with more\nadvanced features together with significant price cutting of their products and the recent acquisitions with much smaller margins than the video solutions\nsegment, historically. The Company incurred operating losses of approximately $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $29.7 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022 and it had an accumulated deficit of $117.7 million as of December 31, 2023. These matters raise substantial\ndoubt about Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In recent years the Company has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise\nfunding through the issuance of debt and equity. In that regard, the Company raised approximately $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021\nthrough two underwritten public offerings. These equity raises were utilized to fund its operations and acquisitions. Management expects to continue this\npattern until it achieves positive cash flows from operations, although it can offer no assurance in this regard.\nThe Company will have to restore positive operating cash flows and profitability over the next year and/or raise additional capital to fund its\noperational plans, meet its customary payment obligations and otherwise execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in\nrestoring positive cash flows and profitability, or that it can raise additional financing when needed, and obtain it on terms acceptable or favorable to the\nCompany.\nThe Company has increased its contract liabilities to nearly $10.3 million as of December 31, 2023, which results in recurring revenue during the\nperiod of 2023 to 2026. The Company believes that its quality control and cost cutting initiatives, expansion to non-law enforcement sales channels and\nnew product introduction will eventually restore positive operating cash flows and profitability, although it can offer no assurances in this regard.\nThe Company has significantly cut costs in its entertainment segment through the removal of several large partnerships and sponsorships. These\nwere not yielding the results management expected; thus, it is not expected that these costs with significantly hinder total revenues in 2024 and beyond.\nIn addition to the initiatives described above, the Board of Directors is conducting a review of a full range of strategic alternatives to best position\nthe Company for the future including, but not limited to, the sale of all or certain assets, properties or groups of properties or individual businesses or\nmerger or combination with another company. The result of this review may also include the continued implementation of the Company’s business plan.\nThere can be no assurance that any additional transactions or financings will result from this process.\nF-18\nIn that regard, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., with a focus and mission to own and\nproduce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the\nentertainment segment will become a separate publicly traded Company while the video and revenue cycle management segments will be retained by\nDigital Ally, Inc.\nBased on the uncertainties described above, the Company believes its business plan does not alleviate the existence of substantial doubt about its\nability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of\nliabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 2. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable. Sales to domestic\ncustomers are typically made on credit and the Company generally does not require collateral while sales to international customers require payment before\nshipment or backing by an irrevocable letter or credit. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and\nmaintains an allowance for estimated losses. Accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance\nfor doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $200,668 as of December 31, 2023 and $152,736 as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accounts that at\ntimes may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major\nfinancial institutions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the uninsured balance amounted to $29,700 and $2,495,189, respectively. The Company uses\nprimarily a network of unaffiliated distributors for international sales and an employee-based direct sales force for domestic sales. No international\ndistributor individually exceeded 10% of total revenues. No one individual customer receivable balance exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s video solutions segment purchases finished circuit boards and other proprietary component parts from suppliers located in the\nUnited States and on a limited basis from Asia. Although the Company obtains certain of these components from single source suppliers, it generally owns\nall tooling and management has located alternative suppliers to reduce the risk in most cases to supplier problems that could result in significant production\ndelays. The Company has not historically experienced significant supply disruptions from any of its principal vendors and does not anticipate future supply\ndisruptions. The Company acquires most of its components on a purchase order basis and does not have long-term contracts with its suppliers.\nNOTE 3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBeginning balance $ 152,736 $ 113,234\nProvision for bad debts 84,446 126,018\nCharge-offs to allowance, net of recoveries (36,514) (86,516)\nEnding balance $ 200,668 $ 152,736\nF-19\nNOTE 4.

The Company entered into a promissory note, through its entertainment segment, as part of a co-marketing\nagreement, with a principal amount of $3,000,000. Principal payment, since its inception, on this promissory note totaled $2,849,846 as of December 31,\n2023, resulting in a remaining balance of $150,154 maturing December 31, 2023. Lease receivable increased by $0.6 million primarily due to increased\nsales under the Company’s subscription model during 2023. The Company determines if an allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating notes\nreceivable and individual customer lease receivables, by considering a customer’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. The\nCompany recorded an allowance of $5,000 and $-0- for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Other receivables relate to a related party receivable\nfurther described in Note 19.\nNOTE 5.

The EIDL is evidenced by an unsecured promissory note, dated May 8, 2020, in the\noriginal principal amount of $150,000 with the SBA, the lender.\nUnder the terms of the note issued under the EIDL program, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The term\nof such note is thirty years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under such note. Monthly principal and interest payments began in\nNovember 2022, after being deferred for thirty months after the date of disbursement and total $731.00 per month thereafter. Such note may be prepaid in\npart or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Company granted the secured party a continuing interest in and to any and all collateral, including but not\nlimited to tangible and intangible personal property.\nThe Company made principal payments of $2,219 and $-0- for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and recorded interest expense of\n$5,606 in 2023.\nContingent Consideration Promissory Notes\nOn June 30, 2021, Nobility Healthcare, a subsidiary of the Company, issued a contingent consideration promissory note (the “June Contingent\nNote”) in connection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “June Seller”) of $350,000. The Contingent\nNote has a three-year term and bears interest at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Quarterly principal and interest payments are deferred for six months and is due\nin equal quarterly installments on the seventh business day of each quarter. The principal amount of the June Contingent Note is subject to an earn-out\nadjustment, being the difference between the $975,000 (the “June Projected Revenue”) and the cash basis revenue (the “June Measurement Period\nRevenue”) collected by the June Seller in its normal course of business from the clients existing on June 30, 2021, during the period from October 1, 2021\nthrough September 30, 2022 (the “June Measurement Period”) measured on a quarterly basis and annualized as of the relevant period. If the June\nMeasurement Period Revenue is less than the June Projected Revenue, such amount will be subtracted from the principal balance of this June Contingent\nNote on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the June Measurement Period Revenue is more than the June Projected Revenue, such amount will be added to the\nprincipal balance of this June Contingent Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In no event will the principal balance of this June Contingent Note become a\nnegative number. The maximum downward earn-out adjustment to the principal balance will be to zero. There are no limits to the increases to the principal\nbalance of the June Contingent Note as a result of the earn-out adjustments.\nThe June Contingent Payment Note is considered to be additional purchase price, therefore the estimated fair value of the contingent liability is\nrecorded as a liability at the acquisition date and the fair value is considered part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. Management has recorded the\ncontingent consideration promissory note at its estimated fair value of $350,000 at the acquisition date. Principal payments, since its inception, on this\ncontingent consideration promissory note totaled $232,134. The estimated fair value of the June Contingent Note at December 31, 2023 is $58,819,\nrepresenting a decrease in its estimated fair value of $117,637 as compared to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2022. This reduction only relates\nto the principal payments made for the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, the Company recorded a gain of $-0- and $27,139 in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nF-23\nOn August 31, 2021, Nobility Healthcare, issued another contingent consideration promissory note (the “August Contingent Payment Note”) in\nconnection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “August Sellers”) of $650,000. The August\nContingent Payment Note has a three-year term and bears interest at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Quarterly principal and interest payments are deferred for\nsix months and is due in equal quarterly installments on the seventh business day of each quarter. The principal amount of the August Contingent Payment\nNote is subject to an earn-out adjustment, being the difference between the $3,000,000 (the “August Projected Revenue”) and the cash basis revenue (the\n“August Measurement Period Revenue”) collected by the August Sellers in its normal course of business from the clients existing on September 1, 2021,\nduring the period from December 1, 2021 through November 30, 2022 (the “August Measurement Period”) measured on a quarterly basis and annualized\nas of the relevant period. If the August Measurement Period Revenue is less than the August Projected Revenue, such amount will be subtracted from the\nprincipal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the August Measurement Period Revenue is more than the August\nProjected Revenue, such amount will be added to the principal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In no event\nwill the principal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note become a negative number. The maximum downward earn-out adjustment to the\nprincipal balance will be to zero. There are no limits to the increases to the principal balance of the August Contingent Payment Note as a result of the earn-\nout adjustments.\nThe August Contingent Payment Note is considered to be additional purchase price, therefore the estimated fair value of the contingent liability is\nrecorded as a liability at the acquisition date and the fair value is considered part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. Management has recorded the\ncontingent consideration promissory note at its estimated fair value of $650,000 at the acquisition date. Principal payments, since its inception, on this\ncontingent consideration promissory note totaled $552,256. The estimated fair value of the August Contingent Note at December 31, 2023 is $129,651,\nrepresenting a decrease in its estimated fair value of $259,303 as compared to is estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023. This reduction only relates\nto the principal payments made for the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, the Company recorded a loss of $-0- and $31,907 in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare issued another contingent consideration promissory note (the “January Contingent Payment Note”) in\nconnection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “January Sellers”) of $750,000.

If the January Measurement Period Revenue is less than the January Projected Revenue, such amount will be\nsubtracted from the principal balance of this January Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the January Measurement Period Revenue is\nmore than the January Projected Revenue, such amount will be added to the principal balance of this January Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-\ndollar basis. In no event will the principal balance of this January Contingent Payment Note become a negative number. The maximum downward earn-out\nadjustment to the principal balance will be a reduction to zero. There are no limits to the increases to the principal balance of the January Contingent\nPayment Note as a result of the earn-out adjustments.\nOn January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare issued another contingent consideration promissory note (the “January Contingent Payment Note”) in\nconnection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “January Sellers”) of $750,000.

The TicketSmarter Earn-Out shall be payable with ninety percent\n(90%) readily available funds and ten percent (10%) in stock consideration. The principal amount of the TicketSmarter Earn-Out is subject to an earn-out\nadjustment, being the difference between the $2,896,829 (the “Projected EBITDA”) and the actual EBITDA (the “Measurement Period EBITDA”)\ngenerated by TicketSmarter in its normal course of business, during the period from September 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the “Measurement\nPeriod”). If the Measurement Period EBITDA is less than seventy percent (70%) of the Projected EBITDA, there will be zero contingent payment. If the\nMeasurement Period EBITDA is between seventy percent (70%) and one hundred percent (100%) of the Projected EBITDA, then a fractional amount of\nthe contingent payment will be paid out. If the Measurement Period EBITDA is more than the Projected EBITDA, the full principal balance of this\nTicketSmarter Earn-Out will be paid out. In no event will the principal balance of this TicketSmarter Earn-Out become a negative number. The maximum\ndownward earn-out adjustment to the earn-out balance will be to reduce the balance to zero.\nThe contingent consideration earn-out is considered to be additional purchase price, therefore the estimated fair value of the contingent liability is\nrecorded as a liability at the acquisition date and the fair value is considered part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. Management has recorded the\ncontingent consideration earn-out at its estimated fair value of $3,700,000 at the acquisition date. Management determined that the actual Measurement\nPeriod EBITDA generated by TicketSmarter was less than 70% of the Projected EBITDA threshold. Therefore, no TicketSmarter Earn-Out payments\namounts were due under the agreement. Therefore, the fair value of the contingent consideration earn-out agreement was reduced to zero, and the resulting\ngain of $-0- and $-0- was reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\nF-25\n2023 Commercial Extension of Credit\nOn February 23, 2023, the Company’s Entertainment segment entered into an extension of credit in the form of a loan to use in marketing and\noperating its business in accordance with the Private Label Agreement previously entered into with the Lender.

The Purchase Agreement provided for a ten percent (10%) original interest discount resulting in\ngross proceeds to the Company of $2,700,000. No interest accrues under the Notes. The Warrants are exercisable for an aggregate 1,125,000 shares\ncomprised of 375,000 warrants at an exercise price of $5.50 per share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 (the “Common Stock”), 375,000\nwarrants at an exercise price of $6.50 per share of Common Stock, and 375,000 warrants at an exercise price of $7.50 per share of Common Stock.\nSubject to certain conditions, within 18 months from the effectiveness date and while the Notes remain outstanding, the Purchasers have the right\nto require the Company to consummate a second closing of up to an additional $3,000,000 of Notes (the “Second Notes”) and Warrants on the same terms\nand conditions as the First Closing, except that the Second Notes may be subordinate to a mortgage on the Company’s headquarters building (the “Bank\nMortgage”).\nThe Notes are convertible into shares of Common Stock at the election of the Purchasers at any time at a fixed conversion price of $5.00 (the\n“Conversion Price”) per share of Common Stock. The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits,\nreclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based adjustment in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or\nexchangeable for, Common Stock at a price below the then-applicable Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions). Subject to certain conditions,\nincluding certain equity conditions, the Company may redeem some or all of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note for cash in an amount equal\nto 110% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (the “Optional Redemption Amount”).

If\nthe Registration Statement is not filed by the Filing Date or is not declared effective by the Effectiveness Date, or under certain other circumstances\ndescribed in the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company shall be obligated to pay, as partial liquidated damages, to each Purchaser an amount in\ncash equal to 2% of the original principal amount of the Notes each month until the applicable event giving rise to such payments is cured. If the Company\nfails to pay any partial liquidated damages in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 10% per\nannum.\nThe Company recognized the full warrant derivative value, with the remaining amount being allocated to the debt obligation. As the warrant\nderivative value exceeded the net proceeds from the issuance, the excess amount is recognized as a loss on the date of the issue date. Thus, the Company\nrecorded a loss of $576,380 as an interest expense on the date of issuance relating to the Convertible note. The following is the assumptions used in\ncalculating the estimated grant-date fair value of the detachable warrants to purchase common stock granted in connection with the Convertible Note:\nTerms at\nApril 5, 2023\n(issuance date)\nVolatility - range 106.0%\nRisk-free rate 3.36%\nDividend 0%\nRemaining contractual term 5.0 years\nExercise price $ 5.50 – 7.50\nCommon stock issuable under the warrants 1,125,000\nOn June 2, 2023, the Purchasers elected to convert $125,000 principal, at the fixed price of $5.00 per share of common stock, 25,000 shares\nvalued at $119,750. The loss on conversion of convertible note into common shares, of $93,386, was recorded during the period.\nOn October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement of which a portion of the net proceeds were used to repay the\nprincipal amount of the Convertible debt. The Company made an aggregate payment of $3,162,500 from the proceeds, inclusive of fees to retire the\nconvertible notes. In 2023, the Company amortized $2,169,545 in debt issuance costs associated with the convertible notes and expensed the remaining\nbalance of $731,819 upon extinguishment of the notes. As a result a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $1,019,319 was recorded in our Consolidated\nStatements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Under the Loan Agreement, the Revolving Loans made by Kompass may be repaid and,\nsubject to customary terms and conditions, borrowed again up to, but not including October 26, 2025, unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise\naccelerated, terminated or extended as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall be used by the Borrower for the purpose of working\ncapital and to retire existing debt. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to provide written notice to Kompass prior to creating, assuming or\nincurring any debt or becoming liable, whether as endorser, guarantor, surety or otherwise, for any debt or obligation of any other party. While obligations\nremain outstanding under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to maintain a minimum balance of $97,600 in a reserve account (the “Capital\nReserve Account”). Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is prohibited from creating, assuming, incurring or suffering or permitting to exist any lien of\nany kind or character upon the collateral, which consists of the Mortgaged Property and the Company’s interest in the Capital Reserve Account.

The property mortgaged under the Mortgage consists\nof the Mortgaged Property. The Mortgage contains customary covenants, representations and warranties by the Company. In addition, the Company\nrecorded debt issuance costs of $188,255. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company amortized $16,997 of debt discount under interest\nexpense, compared to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nMerchant Cash Advances\nIn November 2023, the Company obtained a short-term merchant advance, which totaled $1,050,000, from a single lender to fund operations.\nThese advances included origination fees totaling $50,000 for net proceeds of $1,000,000.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), the Company utilizes the market approach to\nmeasure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions\ninvolving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.\nASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The\nfollowing is a brief description of those three levels:\n● Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n● Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)\n● Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value)\nThe following table represents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nWarrant derivative liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,369,738 $ 1,369,738\nContingent consideration promissory notes and\ncontingent consideration earn-out agreement — — 188,470 188,470\n$ — $ — $ 1,558,208 $ 1,558,208\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nWarrant derivative liabilities $ — $ — $ — $ —\nContingent consideration promissory notes and\ncontingent consideration earn-out agreement — — 777,840 777,840\n$ — $ — $ 777,840 $ 777,840\nThe following table represents the change in Level 3 tier value measurements:\nContingent\nConsideration\nPromissory Notes and Warrant Derivative\nEarn-Out Agreement Liabilities\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ 777,840 $ —\nIssuance of warrant derivative liabilities — 3,216,380\nChange in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities — (1,846,642)\nPrincipal payments on contingent consideration promissory notes – Revenue Cycle\nManagement Acquisitions (411,460) —\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration promissory notes - Revenue Cycle\nManagement Acquisitions (177,910) —\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 188,470 $ 1,369,738\nF-29\nNOTE 12.

The Company determined that it was appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on\nnet deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, primarily because of the current year operating losses.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nStock-based compensation $ 305,000 $ 510,000\nStart-up costs 110,000 110,000\nInventory reserves 1,120,000 1,355,000\nUniform capitalization of inventory costs 115,000 70,000\nAllowance for doubtful accounts receivable 50,000 40,000\nProperty, plant and equipment depreciation 230,000 290,000\nDeferred revenue 2,535,000 1,965,000\nAccrued litigation reserve 500,000 60,000\nAccrued expenses 35,000 50,000\nNet operating loss carryforward 35,365,000 27,940,000\nResearch and development tax credit carryforward 1,795,000 1,795,000\nState jobs credit carryforward 230,000 230,000\nCharitable contributions carryforward 95,000 95,000\nTotal deferred tax assets 42,485,000 34,510,000\nValuation reserve (41,610,000) (34,200,000)\nTotal deferred tax assets 875,000 310,000\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nWarrant derivative liabilities (455,000) —\nIntangible assets (265,000) (165,000\nDomestic international sales company (155,000) (145,000)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (875,000) (310,000)\nNet deferred tax assets (liability) $ — $ —\nThe valuation allowance on deferred tax assets totaled $41,610,000 and $34,200,000 as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany records the benefit it will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences as “deferred tax\nassets.” In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets\nif, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company incurred operating losses in 2023 and 2022 and it continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position at December 31, 2023 and\n2022. Accordingly, the Company determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding its potential for future profits to outweigh the negative\nevidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, it determined to increase our valuation allowance\nby $7,870,000 but continue to fully reserve its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023. The Company expects to continue to maintain a full valuation\nallowance until it determines that it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize these assets. To the extent the Company\ndetermines that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the\nvaluation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock\noption exercises, an increase in shareholders’ equity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had available approximately $140,940,000 of Federal net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset\nfuture taxable income generated. Such tax net operating loss carry-forwards expire between 2025 and 2043, with $91,352,000 of the tax net operating loss\ncarry-forwards have an indefinite life since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition, the Company had research and development\ntax credit carry-forwards totaling $1,794,000 available as of December 31, 2023, which expire between 2024 and 2040.\nThe Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards in\nthe event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Current estimates prepared by the Company indicate that\ndue to ownership changes which have occurred, approximately $765,000 of its net operating loss and $175,000 of its research and development tax credit\ncarry-forwards are currently subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,151,000 and may be further limited by additional ownership changes\nwhich may occur in the future. As stated above, the net operating loss and research and development credit carry-forwards expire between 2024 and 2039,\nallowing the Company to potentially utilize all of the limited net operating loss carry-forwards during the carry-forward period.\nAs discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first\ndetermines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the\nlargest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management has identified no tax positions taken that\nwould meet or exceed these thresholds and therefore there are no gross interest, penalties and unrecognized tax expense/benefits that are not expected to\nultimately result in payment or receipt of cash in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 varied from the expected statutory rate due to the Company continuing to\nprovide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on\nnet deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, primarily because of the current year operating losses.\nThe Company’s federal and state income tax returns are closed for examination purposes by relevant statute and by examination for 2019 and all\nprior tax years.\nF-30\nNOTE 14.

Total lease expense\nunder the five operating leases was approximately $534,830 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 4.5\nyears and 3.3 years, respectively.\nThe discount rate implicit within the Company’s operating leases was not generally determinable, and therefore, the Company determined the\ndiscount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate on the information available at commencement date. As of commencement date, the operating lease\nliabilities reflect a weighted average discount rate of 8%.\nThe following sets forth the operating lease right of use assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023:\nAssets:\nOperating lease right of use assets $ 1,053,159\nLiabilities:\nOperating lease obligations-current portion 279,538\nOperating lease obligations-less current portion 827,836\nTotal operating lease obligations $ 1,107,374\nF-31\nFollowing are the minimum lease payments for each year and in total.\nYear ending December 31:\n2024 $ 358,424\n2025 311,849\n2026 293,300\n2027 117,492\nThereafter 235,020\nTotal undiscounted minimum future lease payments 1,316,085\nImputed interest (208,711)\nTotal operating lease liability $ 1,107,374\nNOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation.\nFrom time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose the\nspecifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and assuming\nwe determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against us. We record a\nliability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not probable, we determine whether\nit is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for\naccrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and\ncircumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update\naccruals as matters progress over time.\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit against Culp McAuley, Inc. (“defendant”) in the United States District Court for the District of\nKansas. The lawsuit arises from the defendant’s multiple breaches of its obligations to the Company. The Company seeks monetary damages and injunctive\nrelief based on certain conduct by the defendant. On July 18, 2022, the defendant filed its Answer to the Company’s Verified Complaint and included\nCounterclaims alleging breach of contract and seeking monetary damages. On August 8, 2022, the Company filed its Reply and Affirmative Defenses to\nthe Counterclaims by, among other things, denying the allegations and any and all liability.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss related to the Culp McCauley case, our estimate of the\naggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) was approximately $1.8 million. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental\nagencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result,\nactual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nWhile the ultimate resolution is unknown, based on the information currently available, we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or\nin the aggregate, have a material adverse effect to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is\ninherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will\nbe covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect\non our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nF-32\nGeneral\n401 (k) Plan. The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan, as amended, requires it to\nprovide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching contributions\nfor employee’s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company made matching contributions totaling $207,463 and $223,084 for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions.\nNOTE 16. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock issued of $452,071 and $1,282,757\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had adopted ten separate stock option and restricted stock plans: (i) the 2005 Stock Option and Restricted\nStock Plan (the “2005 Plan”), (ii) the 2006 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), (iii) the 2007 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan\n(the “2007 Plan”), (iv) the 2008 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2008 Plan”), (v) the 2011 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2011\nPlan”), (vi) the 2013 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2013 Plan”), (vii) the 2015 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”),\n(viii) the 2018 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2018 Plan”), (ix) the 2020 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2020 Plan”), and (x)\nthe 2022 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”). The 2005 Plan, 2006 Plan, 2007 Plan, 2008 Plan, 2011 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2015 Plan,\n2018 Plan, 2020 Plan and 2022 Plan are referred to as the “Plans.”\nThese Plans permit the grant of stock options or restricted stock to its employees, non-employee directors and others for up to a total of 333,750\nshares of common stock. The 2005 Plan terminated during 2015 with 1,078 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for\nissuance. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 total 284. The 2006 Plan terminated\nduring 2016 with 2,739 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. Stock options granted under the 2006\nPlan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 total 531. The 2007 Plan terminated during 2017 with 4,733 shares not awarded or\nunderlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. There are no stock options granted under the 2007 Plan that remain unexercised and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023. The 2008 Plan terminated during 2018 with 2,025 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now\nunavailable for issuance. There are no stock options granted under the 2008 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nOur Board of Directors adopted the 2020 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2020 Plan”) on June 30, 2020 and the Company’s\nstockholders approved the 2020 Plan at the Annual Meeting held on September 9, 2020. The Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2020\nPlan at the Annual Meeting held on June 22, 2021 which increased the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance under the\n2020 Plan to a total of 125,000. A total of 112,958 options and restricted stock have been granted under the 2020 Plan to date. The 2020 Plan also\nauthorizes us to grant (i) to the key employees’ incentive stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock and non-qualified stock options to purchase\nshares of Common Stock and restricted stock awards and (ii) to non-employee directors and consultants non-qualified stock options and restricted stock.\nF-33\nOur Board of Directors adopted the 2022 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) on October 28, 2022 and the Company’s\nstockholders approved the 2022 Plan at the Annual Meeting held on December 7, 2022. The number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved\nfor issuance under the 2022 Plan totals 125,000. The 2022 Plan also authorizes us to grant (i) to the key employees’ incentive stock options to purchase\nshares of Common Stock and non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock and restricted stock awards and (ii) to non-employee\ndirectors and consultants non-qualified stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company believes that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of its stockholders. Option awards have been\ngranted with an exercise price equal to the market price of its stock at the date of grant with such option awards generally vesting based on the completion\nof continuous service and having ten-year contractual terms. These option awards typically provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as\ndefined in the Plans). The Company has registered all shares of common stock that are issuable under its Plans with the SEC. A total of 137,042 shares\nremained available for awards under the various Plans as of December 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.\nActivity in the various Plans during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is reflected in the following table:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nOptions Shares Exercise Price\nOutstanding at January 1, 2022 54,303 $ 47.40\nGranted 1,250 19.60\nExercised — —\nForfeited (1,603) (80.80)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 53,950 $ 45.80\nExercisable at December 31, 2022 53,950 $ 45.80\nWeighted\nNumber of Average\nOptions Shares Exercise Price\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 53,950 $ 45.80\nGranted — —\nExercised — —\nForfeited (350) (83.20)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 53,600 $ 45.55\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 53,600 $ 45.55\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The total estimated grant date\nfair value stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $-0- and $22,768, respectively.\nThe Company has utilized the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the estimated grant date fair value\nof the options during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\nAssumptions Assumptions\nVolatility – range — 111.67%\nRisk-free rate — 1.81%\nExpected term — 10.0 years\nExercise price — $ 19.60\nF-34\nThe Plans allow for the cashless exercise of stock options. This provision allows the option holder to surrender/cancel options with an intrinsic\nvalue equivalent to the purchase/exercise price of other options exercised. There were no shares surrendered pursuant to cashless exercises during the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was approximately $-0- and $-0-, respectively, and the\naggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable was approximately $-0- and $-0-, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable\noptions under the Company’s option plans as of December 31, 2023:\nOutstanding options Exercisable options\nWeighted\naverage Weighted average\nExercise price Number of remaining Number of remaining\nrange options contractual life options contractual life\n$ 0.01 to $49.99 37,000 6.6 years 37,000 6.6 years\n$ 50.00 to $69.99 15,100 4.5 years 15,100 4.5 years\n$ 70.00 to $89.99 1,500 2.4 years 1,500 2.4 years\n53,600 5.9 years 53,600 5.9 years\nRestricted stock grants. The Board of Directors has granted restricted stock awards under the Plans. Restricted stock awards are valued on the date\nof grant and have no purchase price for the recipient. Restricted stock awards typically vest over one to four years corresponding to anniversaries of the\ngrant date. Under the Plans, unvested shares of restricted stock awards may be forfeited upon the termination of service to or employment with the\nCompany, depending upon the circumstances of termination. Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of restricted stock, holders of unvested\nrestricted stock have full stockholder’s rights, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends.\nA summary of all restricted stock activity under the equity compensation plans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nWeighted\nNumber of average\nRestricted grant date\nshares fair value\nNonvested balance, January 1, 2022 52,869 $ 37.40\nGranted 60,750 14.67\nVested (31,244) (34.73)\nForfeited (3,250) (21.20)\nNonvested balance, December 31, 2022 79,125 $ 21.73\nWeighted\nNumber of average\nRestricted grant date\nshares fair value\nNonvested balance, January 1, 2023 79,125 $ 21.73\nGranted 35,000 5.00\nVested (56,625) (21.29)\nForfeited (3,625) (22.41)\nNonvested balance, December 31, 2023 53,875 $ 11.27\nF-35\nThe Company estimated the fair market value of these restricted stock grants based on the closing market price on the date of the grant. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there was $140,573 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to all remaining non-vested restricted stock grants, which will be\namortized over the next forty-eight months in accordance with their respective vesting scale.\nThe nonvested balance of restricted stock vests as follows:\nNumber of\nYears ended shares\n2024 27,750\n2025 19,000\n2026 4,125\n2027 2,000\n2028 1,000\nNOTE 17. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS\n2021 Purchase Warrants\nThe Company has issued Common Stock purchase warrants in conjunction with various debt and equity issuances. The warrants are either\nimmediately exercisable or have a delayed initial exercise date, no more than nine months from their respective issue date and allow the holders to purchase\nup to 1,148,286 shares of common stock at $5.50 to $52.00 per share as of December 31, 2023. The warrants expire from July 31, 2023 through April 5,\n2028 and under certain circumstances allow for cashless exercise.\nOn January 14, 2021 and February 1, 2021, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 2,127,500 shares of Common Stock. The warrant\nterms provide for net cash settlement outside the control of the Company under certain circumstances in the event of tender offers. As such, the Company is\nrequired to treat these warrants as derivative liabilities which are valued at their estimated fair value at their issuance date and at each reporting date with\nany subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities. Furthermore, the\nCompany re-values the fair value of warrant derivative liability as of the date the warrant is exercised with the resulting warrant derivative liability\ntransitioned to change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities through the consolidated statement of operations.\nOn August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with the Investors cancelling\nFebruary Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 384,077 shares of Common Stock in consideration for its issuance of (i) new warrants (the “Exchange\nWarrants”) to the Investors exercisable for an aggregate of up to 384,077 shares of Common Stock. The Company also issued warrants (the “Replacement\nOriginal Warrants”) replacing the February Warrants for the remaining shares of Common Stock exercisable thereunder, representing an aggregate of\n330,923 shares of Common Stock, and extended the expiration date of the February Warrants to September 18, 2026. The Exchange Warrants provide for\nan initial exercise price of $65.00 per share, subject to customary adjustments thereunder, and are immediately exercisable upon issuance for cash and on a\ncashless basis. On the date of the exchange, the Company calculated the fair value, using the Black-Scholes method, of the cancelled February Warrants\nand the newly issued Exchange Warrants, the difference in fair value measurement of the respective warrants was attributed to warrant modification\nexpense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nF-36\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company entered into Warrant Exchange Agreements (the “Warrant Exchange Agreements”) with certain investors (the\n“Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investors an aggregate of 303,750 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the\ncancellation by the Investors of the January Warrants, the Exchange Warrants and the Replacement Originals Warrants. On the date of the exchange, the\nCompany calculated the fair value of the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the Warrant Exchange Agreements, attributing that value to\ncommon stock and additional paid in capital. The remaining value of the warrant derivative liability was attributed to an income from change in fair market\nvalue of warrant derivative liabilities and gain on extinguishment of warrant derivative liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations. On the date of\nthe Warrant Exchange Agreement, using the Black-Scholes method, the fair value of the warrant derivative liability was $8.1 million, compared to $9.3\nmillion at June 30, 2022, resulting in income from change in fair market value of warrant derivative liabilities of $1.2 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Further, the value of the issued shares of Common Stock was $4.5 million, applied to additional paid in capital, resulting in a gain on\nthe extinguishment of warrant derivative liabilities of $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTerms at\nAugust 23, 2022\nVolatility - range 103.7%\nRisk-free rate 3.17 - 3.36%\nDividend 0%\nRemaining contractual term 3.4 - 4.1 years\nExercise price $ 65.00\nCommon stock issuable under the warrants 1,215,000\nFluctuations in the Company’s stock price are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. As the\nstock price increases for each of the related derivative instruments, the value to the holder of the instrument generally increases, therefore increasing the\nliability on the Company’s balance sheet. Additionally, stock price volatility is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of each of the Company’s derivative instruments. The simulated fair value of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the Company’s\nexpected volatility. Increases in expected volatility would generally result in higher fair value measurement. A 10% change in pricing inputs and changes in\nvolatilities and correlation factors would not result in a material change in our Level 3 fair value.\n2023 Purchase Warrants\nOn April 5, 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock. The warrant terms provide for net cash\nsettlement outside the control of the Company under certain circumstances. As such, the Company is required to treat these warrants as derivative liabilities\nwhich are valued at their estimated fair value at their issuance date and at each reporting date with any subsequent changes reported in the consolidated\nstatements of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities. Furthermore, the Company re-values the fair value of warrant\nderivative liability as of the date the warrant is exercised with the resulting warrant derivative liability transitioned to change in fair value of warrant\nderivative liabilities through the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company has utilized the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the estimated fair value of the\nwarrant derivative liabilities as of their date of issuance and as of December 31, 2023:\nIssuance date December 31, 2023\nassumptions assumptions\nVolatility - range 106.0% $ 105.4%\nRisk-free rate 3.36% 3.84%\nDividend 0% 0%\nRemaining contractual term 5.0 years 4.3 years\nExercise price 5.50 – 7.50 5.50 – 7.50\nCommon stock issuable under the warrants 1,125,000 1,125,000\nF-37\nThe following table summarizes information about shares issuable under warrants outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nWeighted\naverage\nWarrants exercise price\nVested Balance, January 1, 2022 1,300,430 $ 64.80\nGranted — —\nExercised — —\nCancelled (1,232,971) (65.08)\nVested Balance, December 31, 2022 67,459 $ 60.26\nWeighted\naverage\nWarrants exercise price\nVested Balance, January 1, 2023 67,459 $ 60.26\nGranted 1,125,000 6.50\nExercised — —\nForfeited/cancelled (67,459) (60.26)\nVested Balance, December 31, 2023 1,125,000 $ 6.50\nThe total intrinsic value of all outstanding warrants aggregated $-0- as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the weighted average remaining term\nwas 51.2 and 3.9 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable\nwarrants to purchase shares of common stock as of December 31, 2023:\nOutstanding and exercisable warrants\nWeighted average\nExercise Number of remaining\nprice warrants contractual life\n$ 5.50 375,000 4.3 years\n$ 6.50 375,000 4.3 years\n$ 7.50 375,000 4.3 years\n1,125,000 4.3 years\nNOTE 18 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n2022 Issuance of Restricted Common Stock.\nOn January 7, 2022, the board of directors approved the grant of 26,250 shares of common stock to officers of the Company.

The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of\ntime of filing. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would have\notherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, our board\napproved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of our Common Stock,\nincluding, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. All historical share and per-share amounts\nreflected throughout our consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock\nSplit as if the split occurred as of the earliest period presented. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.\nAs a result of the Reverse Stock Split, no fractional shares of new common stock will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, all of\nwhich shares of new common stock shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of such shares. Therefore, the Company issued 24,206 shares pursuant\nto Reverse Stock Split related to rounding up to the nearest whole number of shares.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Company owns a 51% equity interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Nobility Healthcare. As a result, the noncontrolling shareholders or\nminority interest is allocated 49% of the income/loss of Nobility Healthcare which is reflected in the statement of (income) loss as “net (income) loss\nattributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiary”. We reported net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated\nsubsidiary of $224,598 and $407,933 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nConversion of Convertible Note\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, pursuant to the Convertible Note, the Purchasers elected to convert $125,000 principal, at the fixed\nprice of $5.00 per share of common stock, 25,000 shares valued at $119,750.\nCancellation of Common Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company cancelled 3,625 shares for various reasons.\nNOTE 19.

For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, all shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants were\nantidilutive, and, therefore, not included in the computation of diluted loss per share.\nNOTE 21. DIGITAL ALLY HEALTHCARE VENTURE\nOn June 4, 2021, Digital Ally Healthcare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a venture with Nobility LLC (“Nobility”), an\neight-year-old revenue cycle management (“RCM”) company servicing the medical industry, to form Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”).\nDigital Ally Healthcare is capitalizing the venture with $13.5 million to support the venture’s business strategy to make acquisitions of RCM companies.\nDigital Ally Healthcare owns 51% of the venture that entitles it to 51% of the distributable cash as defined in the venture’s operating agreement plus a\ncumulative preferred return of 10% per annum on its invested capital. Nobility will receive a management fee and 49% of the distributable cash,\nsubordinated to Digital Ally Healthcare’s preferred return. The venture comprises the Company’s revenue cycle management segment.\nF-41\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company’s revenue cycle management segment completed the acquisition of a private medical billing company (the\n“Healthcare Acquisition”). In accordance with the stock purchase agreement, the Company’s revenue cycle management segment agreed to a non-\nrefundable initial payment (the “Initial Payment Amount”) of $850,000. In addition to the Initial Payment Amount, the Company’s revenue cycle\nmanagement segment agreed to issue a promissory note to the stockholders of the Healthcare Acquisition in the principal amount of $350,000 that is\nsubject to an earn-out adjustment. Management’s estimate of the fair value of this Contingent Note at December 31, 2021 is $317,212. The gain associated\nwith the adjustment in the estimated fair value of this contingent promissory note is recorded as a gain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. Lastly, the Company’s revenue cycle management segment agreed to pay $162,552 representing the principal and accrued\ninterest balance due under a promissory note issued to the selling shareholders prior to the acquisition closing date. The Company’s revenue cycle\nmanagement segment anticipates the estimated fair value of the contingent promissory note to be paid in full, therefore, the total aggregate purchase price\nwas determined to be approximately $1,376,509. Total acquisition related costs aggregated $164,630, which was expensed as incurred. Subsequent to the\nacquisition date, the Company received further information regarding the purchased assets and assumed liabilities. As a result, the initial allocation of the\npurchase price was adjusted by increasing accounts receivable by $75,000 with a corresponding reduction of goodwill during the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of\nRegulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, the presentation of the assets acquired,\nhistorical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 8 of Regulation S-X, respectively, are not required to be\npresented. Under the acquisition method, the purchase price of the Healthcare Acquisition has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the time of the Healthcare Acquisition. This allocation involves a number of\nassumptions, estimates, and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. Our assumptions and\nestimates are based upon information obtained from the management of the Company’s revenue cycle management segment. The acquisition was\nstructured as stock purchase, therefore the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which will not\nbe amortized for income tax filing purposes. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the\nacquisition date.\nThe purchase price of the Healthcare Acquisition was allocated to the tangible assets, and assumed liabilities based on their preliminary estimated\nfair values at the time of the Healthcare Acquisition.

These adjustments primarily related to estimated identifiable intangible asset fair values of client agreements and goodwill.\nDuring the measurement period (which is the period required to obtain all necessary information that existed at the acquisition date, or to conclude\nthat such information is unavailable, not to exceed one year), additional assets or liabilities may be recognized, or there could be changes to the amounts of\nassets or liabilities previously recognized on a preliminary basis, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the\nacquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of these assets or liabilities as of that date. The change in fair value of the contingent\nconsideration is more fully described in Note 10, “Debt Obligations”.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company’s revenue cycle management segment completed the acquisition of another private medical billing company\n(the “Medical Billing Acquisition”). In accordance with the stock purchase agreement, Nobility Healthcare agreed to a non-refundable initial payment (the\n“Initial Payment Amount”) of $2,270,000. In addition to the Initial Payment Amount, the Company’s revenue cycle management segment agreed to issue a\ncontingent promissory note to the stockholders of the Medical Billing Acquisition in the principal amount of $650,000 that is subject to an earn-out\nadjustment. The Company’s revenue cycle management segment anticipates the estimated fair value of the contingent promissory note to be paid in full,\ntherefore, the total aggregate purchase price was determined to be approximately $2,920,000. Total acquisition related costs aggregated $5,602, which was\nexpensed as incurred.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of\nRegulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant.

Total acquisition related costs\naggregated $10,322, which was expensed as incurred.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations”, the acquisition method of accounting is used, and recognition of the assets acquired is at\nfair value as of the acquisition dates. All acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. The consideration paid has been allocated to the assets acquired based\non their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The estimate of fair values for the intangible assets acquired were agreed to by both buyer and seller.\nThe estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in the Medical Billing Asset Acquisition were as follows:\nDescription Amount\nAssets acquired:\nIntangible assets acquired – client agreements $ 335,000\nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 335,000\nConsideration:\nCash paid at acquisition date $ 230,000\nContingent consideration promissory note 105,000\nTotal acquisition purchase price $ 335,000\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives in years as of the date of\nacquisition:\nAmortization\nthrough\nDecember 31, Estimated\nCost 2023 useful life\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nClient agreements $ 335,000 $ 64,208 10 years\nThe change in fair value of the contingent consideration is more fully described in Note 10, “Debt Obligations” and will be estimated on a\nquarterly basis.\nF-46\nNOTE 22. TICKETSMARTER ACQUISITION\nOn September 1, 2021, Digital Ally, Inc. formed TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”), through which the Company completed the acquisition of\nGoody Tickets, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“Goody Tickets”) and TicketSmarter, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“TicketSmarter\nLLC”), collectively the “TicketSmarter Acquisition”. TicketSmarter, Inc. comprises the Company’s entertainment business segment. In accordance with the\nstock purchase agreement, the Company agreed to an initial payment (the “Initial Payment Amount”) of $9,403,600 through a combination of cash and\ncommon stock. In addition to the Initial Payment Amount, the Company agreed to issue an earn-out agreement to the stockholders of Goody Tickets and\nTicketSmarter LLC in the contingent amount of $4,244,400 that is subject to an earn-out adjustment based on actual EBITDA achieved in 2021, of which\nthe Company gave a fair value of $3,700,000 on the date of acquisition. However, following the completion of 2021, it was determined that the actual\nEBITDA threshold for any earn-out adjustment to be paid was not met. Thus, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the fair value of the contingent earn-out is\nreduced to zero, and the associated gain related to this revaluation is recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December\n31, 2021. Lastly, included in the agreement, the Company agreed to place $500,000 in escrow, subject to a working capital adjustment based on actual\nworking capital amounts on the acquisition date as defined in the agreement, this amount was subject to disbursement 45 days following the close of the\nacquisition. The parties completed the working capital adjustment resulting in the Company retaining $297,726 of the escrow amount with the $202,274\nreleased to the Sellers. The total acquisition related costs aggregated $40,625, which was expensed as incurred.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of\nRegulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, the presentation of the assets acquired,\nhistorical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, are not required to be\npresented. Under the acquisition method, the purchase price of the TicketSmarter Acquisition has been allocated to Goody Tickets’ and TicketSmarter\nLLC’s acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the time of the TicketSmarter\nAcquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in\nour financial statements. The TicketSmarter Acquisition was structured as a stock purchase; however the parties agreed to coordinate the election to invoke\nIRS Section 338(h)(10) relative to this transaction for tax purposes. Therefore, the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired\nwas recorded as goodwill, which will be amortized over 15 years for income tax filing purposes. Likewise, the other acquired assets were stepped up to fair\nvalue and is deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from\nthe acquisition date.\nThe purchase price of the TicketSmarter Acquisition was allocated to Goody Tickets’ and TicketSmarter LLC’s tangible assets, goodwill,\nidentifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values at the time of the TicketSmarter Acquisition. The\nCompany retained the services of an independent valuation firm to determine the fair value of these identifiable intangible assets. The preliminary and final\nestimated fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in the TicketSmarter Acquisition were as follows:\nPurchase price allocation\nAs allocated Final as allocated\nDescription September 30, 2021 December 31, 2021\nAssets acquired:\nTangible assets acquired, including $51,432 of cash acquired $ 7,139,930 $ 5,748,291\nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired — 6,800,000\nGoodwill 11,839,308 5,886,547\nLiabilities assumed (5,128,964) (5,128,964)\nNet assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 13,850,274 $ 13,305,874\nConsideration:\nCash paid at TicketSmarter Acquisition date $ 8,413,240 $ 8,413,240\nCommon stock issued as consideration for TicketSmarter Acquisition at date of acquisition 990,360 990,360\nContingent consideration earn-out agreement 4,244,400 3,700,000\nCash paid at closing to escrow amount 500,000 500,000\nCash retained from escrow amount pursuant to settlement of working capital target (297,726) (297,726)\nTotal TicketSmarter Acquisition purchase price $ 13,850,274 $ 13,305,874\nF-47\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives in years as of the date of\nacquisition:\nAmortization\nthrough Estimated\nCost December 31, 2023 useful life\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nTrademarks $ 600,000 $ — indefinite\nSponsorship agreement network 5,600,000 2,613,333 5 years\nSearch engine optimization/content 600,000 350,000 4 years\n$ 6,800,000 $ 2,963,333\nFor the period from the date of the TicketSmarter Acquisition to December 31, 2021, the Company adjusted its preliminary fair value estimates\nand estimated useful lives based upon information obtained through December 31, 2021, which resulted in adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the\npurchase price. These adjustments primarily related to estimated identifiable intangible asset fair values (primarily related to the sponsorship agreement\nnetwork), the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out agreement liability and goodwill. There were no adjustments to the allocation of the purchase\nprice during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the measurement period (which is the period required to obtain all necessary information that existed at the acquisition date, or to conclude\nthat such information is unavailable, not to exceed one year), additional assets or liabilities may be recognized, or there could be changes to the amounts of\nassets or liabilities previously recognized on a preliminary basis, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the\nacquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of these assets or liabilities as of that date. The change in fair value of the contingent\nconsideration is more fully described in Note 10, “Debt Obligations”.\nNOTE 23. SEGMENT DATA\nThe accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial\nstatements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Operating segments are identified as components of\nan enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer or “CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s three operating segments are\nVideo Solutions, Revenue Cycle Management, and Entertainment, each of which has specific personnel responsible for that business and reports to the\nCODM. Corporate expenses capture the Company’s corporate administrative activities, is also to be reported in the segment information. The Company’s\ncaptive insurance subsidiary provides services to the Company’s other business segments and not to outside customers. Therefore, its operations are\neliminated in consolidation and is not considered a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Video Solutions Segment encompasses our law, commercial, and shield divisions. This segment includes both service and product revenues\nthrough our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety solutions. The Revenue Cycle\nManagement Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout the country, as a monthly\nservice fee. The Entertainment Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing platform,\nticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms.\nF-48\nThe Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the corporate line item. These activities primarily include expense related to\ncertain corporate officers and support staff, certain accounting staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, stock option expense for options\ngranted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and\nprofessional fee expenses. Corporate identifiable assets primarily consist of cash, invested cash (if any), refundable income taxes (if any), and deferred\nincome taxes.\nSummarized financial information for the Company’s reportable business segments is provided for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet Revenues:\nVideo Solutions $ 7,471,285 $ 8,252,288\nRevenue Cycle Management 6,713,678 7,886,107\nEntertainment 14,063,381 20,871,500\nTotal Net Revenues $ 28,248,344 $ 37,009,895\nGross Profit (loss):\nVideo Solutions $ 1,290,509 $ (1,250,277)\nRevenue Cycle Management 2,772,271 3,303,477\nEntertainment 1,699,704 268,741\nTotal Gross Profit $ 5,762,484 $ 2,321,941\nOperating Income (loss):\nVideo Solutions $ (7,135,584) $ (9,278,721)\nRevenue Cycle Management 292,543 357,705\nEntertainment (3,646,770) (7,369,241)\nCorporate (11,750,742) (13,443,001)\nTotal Operating Income (Loss) $ (22,240,553) $ (29,733,258)\nDepreciation and Amortization:\nVideo Solutions $ 836,699 $ 769,228\nRevenue Cycle Management 104,352 128,082\nEntertainment 1,277,186 1,279,369\nTotal Depreciation and Amortization $ 2,218,237 $ 2,176,679\nAssets (net of eliminations):\nVideo Solutions $ 26,396,559 $ 28,509,706\nRevenue Cycle Management 2,260,376 2,201,570\nEntertainment 6,324,211 11,190,491\nCorporate 12,047,663 14,766,295\nTotal Identifiable Assets $ 47,028,809 $ 56,668,062\nThe segments recorded noncash items affecting the gross profit and operating income (loss) through the established inventory reserves based on\nestimates of excess and/or obsolete current and non-current inventory.

(the “Company”)\nCLAWBACK POLICY\nEffective as of November 17, 2023\nBackground\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a\nculture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Compensation\nCommittee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) and the Board have therefore adopted this policy, which provides for the recoupment (or\nclawback) of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting\nrequirements under the federal securities laws of the United States (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10D-1”) and the listing standards of\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608.\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding\non all affected individuals. Subject to any limitation under applicable law, the Compensation Committee may authorize and empower any officer or\nemployee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (the “Authorized\nOfficers”) (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).\nCovered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange\nAct and the listing standards of the Nasdaq (“Covered Executives”).\nRecoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with\nany financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Compensation Committee will require prompt reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess\nIncentive Compensation (as defined below) received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on\nwhich the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. For the sake of clarity, recoupment is required in the event of any restatement that\neither: (a) corrects an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements; or (b) corrects an error not\nmaterial to previously issued financial statements, but that would result in a material misstatement if (i) the error was left uncorrected in the then current\nperiod; or (ii) the error correction was recognized in the then current period. The Company’s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is\nnot dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company\nis required to prepare an accounting restatement as described above is the earlier to occur of: (A) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, the\nAuthorized Officers, or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described above; or (B) the date a court, regulator, or other legally\nauthorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement as described above. In accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5608(e), this Policy is\napplicable to Incentive Compensation (as described below) received on or after October 2, 2023.\nIncentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means any of the following, provided that such compensation is granted, earned or vested based\nwholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure affected by the restated financial statements:\n● Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.\n● Stock options.\n● Stock appreciation rights.\n● Restricted stock.\nFinancial reporting measures are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total stockholder return are also financial\nreporting measures. A financial reporting measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. The Company’s financial reporting measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n● Company stock price.\n● Total stockholder return.\n● Revenues.\n● Net income.\n● Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n● Funds from operations.\n● Liquidity measures such as working capital, operating cash flow or Free Cash Flow.\n● Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets.\n● Earnings measures such as earnings per share.\nThis Policy applies to all Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Executive:\n● After beginning service as an executive officer;\n● Who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation;\n● While the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association; and\n● During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as\ndescribed in this Policy. In addition to these last three completed fiscal years, this Policy applies to any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. However, a transition period between\nthe last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would\nbe deemed a completed fiscal year.\nIncentive Compensation is deemed received in the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the Incentive\nCompensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nExcess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive\nCompensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as determined by the Compensation\nCommittee, and without regard to any taxes paid by or withheld from the Covered Executive. If the Compensation Committee cannot determine the amount\nof excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its\ndetermination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total\nstockholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an\naccounting restatement, the amount will be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total stockholder\nreturn upon which the Incentive Compensation was received. In such case, the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nMethod of Recoupment\nThe Compensation Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include,\nwithout limitation:\n● Requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n● Seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n● Offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive in accordance with applicable\nlaw;\n● Cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n● Taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nNo Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Incentive Compensation recovered under this Policy or from any\nconsequence arising therefrom.\nInterpretation\nThe Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the\nExchange Act, Rule 10D-1 and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or Nasdaq.\nEffective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and, in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5608(e), shall apply to\nIncentive Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after October 2, 2023.\nAmendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect regulations adopted by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by Nasdaq. The Board\nmay terminate this Policy at any time.\nOther Recoupment Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of applicable law. The Board and/or Compensation Committee may require that any\nemployment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into or amended on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the\ngrant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of: (a) any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar\npolicy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company, including\ntermination of employment or institution of legal proceedings; and (b) any statutory recoupment requirement, including Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2022. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid to the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022 shall be considered\n(and may be credited) in determining any amounts recovered under this Policy.\nImpracticability\nThe Compensation Committee shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be\nimpracticable, as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1(b)(1)(iv) under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of Nasdaq. In order for the\nCompany to determine that recovery would be impracticable, the Company’s Compensation Committee must conclude the following:\na) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered after making a reasonable\nattempt to recover such Incentive Compensation. Note that the attempt(s) to recover must be documented by the Company and such\ndocumentation provided to Nasdaq;\nb) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Note that the Company must obtain a legal\nopinion of home country counsel that such recovery would result in a violation of local law and provide such opinion to Nasdaq; or\nc) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan under which benefits are broadly available to Company employees to fail\nto meet the requirements for qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus plans under Section 401(a)(13) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nor the minimum vesting standards under Section 411(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\nExhibit Filing\nA copy of this Policy shall be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\nATTESTATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CLAWBACK POLICY FOR DIGITAL ALLY, INC. (the “Company”)\nBy my signature below, I acknowledge and agree that:\n● I have received and read the attached Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) of the Company.\n● I hereby agree to abide by all of the terms of the Policy both during and after my employment with the Company, including, without limitation, by\npromptly repaying or returning any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation to the Company as determined in accordance with the Policy.\n● I hereby waive any claim against the Company, its Authorized Officers and the Board in connection with the implementation of the Policy.\nSignature:\nPrinted\nName:\nDate:"

Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company, whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company.

The EIDL is evidenced by a secured promissory note, dated May 8, 2020, in the original principal amount of $150,000 with the SBA, the lender.\n\nUnder the terms of the note issued under the EIDL program, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The term of such note is thirty years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under such note. Monthly principal and interest payments began in November 2022, after being deferred for thirty months after the date of disbursement and total $731 per month thereafter. Such note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty.

If the June Measurement Period Revenue is less than the June Projected Revenue, such amount will be subtracted from the principal balance of this June Contingent Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the June Measurement Period Revenue is more than the June Projected Revenue, such amount will be added to the principal balance of this June Contingent Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In no event will the principal balance of this June Contingent Note become a negative number. The maximum downward earn-out adjustment to the principal balance will be a reduction to zero. There are no limits to the increases to the principal balance of the June Contingent Note as a result of the earn-out adjustments.\n\nThe June Contingent Note is considered to be additional purchase price; therefore, the estimated fair value of the contingent liability is recorded as a liability at the acquisition date and the fair value is considered part of the consideration paid for the acquisition with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management recorded the contingent consideration promissory note at its estimated fair value of $350,000 at the acquisition date. Total principal payments, since inception, on this contingent consideration promissory note totaled $261,543. The estimated fair value of the June Contingent Note at March 31, 2024 is $29,409, representing a reduction in its estimated fair value of $29,409 as compared to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.

Therefore, the Company recorded no gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, Nobility Healthcare, issued another contingent consideration promissory note (the “August Contingent Payment Note”) in connection with a stock purchase agreement between Nobility Healthcare and a private company (the “August Sellers”) of $650,000.

Quarterly principal and interest payments are deferred for six months and is due in equal quarterly installments on the seventh business day of each quarter.

If the August Measurement Period Revenue is less than the August Projected Revenue, such amount will be subtracted from the principal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the August Measurement Period Revenue is more than the August Projected Revenue, such amount will be added to the principal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In no event will the principal balance of this August Contingent Payment Note become a negative number. The maximum downward earn-out adjustment to the principal balance will be to zero. There are no limits to the increases to the principal balance of the August Contingent Payment Note as a result of the earn-out adjustments.\n\nThe August Contingent Payment Note is considered to be additional purchase price, therefore the estimated fair value of the contingent liability is recorded as a liability at the acquisition date and the fair value is considered part of the consideration paid for the acquisition. Management has recorded the contingent consideration promissory note at its estimated fair value of $650,000 at the acquisition date. Principal payments, since its inception, on this contingent consideration promissory note totaled $617,082. The estimated fair value of the August Contingent Note at March 31, 2024 is $64,826, representing a decrease in its estimated fair value of $64,826 as compared to is estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.

Subject to certain conditions, including certain equity conditions, the Company may redeem some or all of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note for cash in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (the “Optional Redemption Amount”). In addition, the Purchasers may, at their option, demand repayment at the Optional Redemption Amount upon five (5) business days’ written notice following (i) the closing by the Company of the Bank Mortgage, or (ii) a sale by the Company of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents.\n\nThe Notes rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets, as evidenced by (i) a security agreement entered into at the Closing, (ii) a trademark security agreement entered into at the Closing, (iii) a patent security agreement entered into at the Closing, (iv) a guaranty executed by all direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company pursuant to which each of them has agreed to guaranty the obligations of the Company under the Notes, and (v) a mortgage on the Company’s headquarters building in favor of the Purchasers.\n\nAlso at the Closing, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Purchasers. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to prepare and file with the SEC within the 10th business day following the First Closing (the “Filing Date”) a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants, and to use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as promptly as possible, but in any event no later than 45 days following the Filing Date (the “Effectiveness Date”). If the Registration Statement is not filed by the Filing Date or is not declared effective by the Effectiveness Date, or under certain other circumstances described in the Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company shall be obligated to pay, as partial liquidated damages, to each Purchaser an amount in cash equal to 2% of the original principal amount of the Notes each month until the applicable event giving rise to such payments is cured. If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 10% per annum.\n\nThe Company recognized the full warrant derivative value, with the remaining amount being allocated to the debt obligation. As the warrant derivative value exceeded the net proceeds from the issuance, the excess amount is recognized as a loss on the date of the issue date. Thus, the Company recorded a loss of $576,380 as an interest expense on the date of issuance relating to the Notes. The following is the assumptions used in calculating the estimated grant-date fair value of the detachable warrants to purchase common stock granted in connection with the Notes:\n\nSCHEDULE OF WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK GRANTED\n\nTerms at April 5, 2023 (issuance date)  \n---  \nVolatility - range | 106.0| %  \nRisk-free rate | 3.36| %  \nDividend | 0| %  \nRemaining contractual term | 5.0 years  \nExercise price | $| 5.50 – 7.50  \nCommon stock issuable under the warrants | 1,125,000  \n  \nOn June 2, 2023, the Purchasers elected to convert $125,000 principal, at the fixed price of $5.00 per share of common stock, 25,000 shares valued at $119,750. The loss on conversion of convertible note into common shares, of $93,386, was recorded during the period.\n\nOn October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement of which a portion of the net proceeds were used to repay the principal amount of the Convertible debt.

In connection with the Loan Agreement, on October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (the “Mortgage”) by and between the Company, as grantor, and Kompass, as grantee, and issued a Revolving Note (the “Revolving Note”) to Kompass. The gross proceeds to the Company were $4,880,000 before repaying those certain Senior Secured Convertible Notes issued on April 5, 2023 in the aggregate amount of $3,162,500 and paying customary fees and expenses.\n\nPursuant to the Loan Agreement, Kompass agreed to make revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans”) available to the Borrower as the Borrower may from time to time request until, but not including, October 26, 2025, and in such amounts as the Borrower may from time to time request, provided, however, that the aggregate principal balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of $4,880,000 or an amount equal to eighty percent of the value of the mortgaged property, which consists of the real property owned by the Company having an address of 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, KS 66215 (the “Mortgaged Property”). Under the Loan Agreement, the Revolving Loans made by Kompass may be repaid and, subject to customary terms and conditions, borrowed again up to, but not including October 26, 2025, unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise accelerated, terminated or extended as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall be used by the Borrower for the purpose of working capital and to retire existing debt. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to provide written notice to Kompass prior to creating, assuming or incurring any debt or becoming liable, whether as endorser, guarantor, surety or otherwise, for any debt or obligation of any other party. While obligations remain outstanding under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to maintain a minimum balance of $97,600 in a reserve account (the “Capital Reserve Account”). Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is prohibited from creating, assuming, incurring or suffering or permitting to exist any lien of any kind or character upon the collateral, which consists of the Mortgaged Property and the Company’s interest in the Capital Reserve Account. The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties by the Borrower.\n\nPursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company issued the Revolving Note to Kompass whereby the Company and Digital Ally Healthcare jointly and severally promise to pay to the order of Kompass the lesser of (i) $4,880,000.00, or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding under and pursuant to the Loan Agreement at the maturity or maturities and in the amount or amounts stated on the records of Kompass, together with interest (computed on the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360 day year) at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus four percent or (ii) eight percent, on the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time as provided in the Loan Agreement.\n\nThe Company entered into the Mortgage to secure its obligations under the Loan Agreement. The property mortgaged under the Mortgage consists of the Mortgaged Property. The Mortgage contains customary covenants, representations and warranties by the Company. In addition, the Company recorded debt issuance costs of $188,255.

These advances included origination fees totaling $50,000 for net proceeds of $1,000,000.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS** **_Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock Elimination_** On April 5, 2024, Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada an Elimination of Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Elimination Certificate”) and Elimination of Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series B Elimination Certificate”) in order to eliminate and cancel all designations, rights, preferences and limitations of the shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). In December 2022, all 1,400,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that had originally been issued pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series A Certificate of Designations”) and all 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that had originally been issued pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Certificate of Designations”) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company. Prior to the filing of the Series A Elimination Certificate, none of the 1,400,000 authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock or 100,000 authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and no shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock were to be issued subject to the Series A Certificate of Designations or Series B Certificate of Designations. The Series A Elimination Certificate and Series B Elimination Certificate became effective upon their filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. **_Merchant Cash Advances – Video Solutions Segment_** In April 2024, the Company received additional advances of $444,000 from the lender and agreed to new terms where total proceeds received since inception totaled $2,144,000. The Company will repay an aggregate of $2,880,000 to the lender. The advances remain secured by expected future sales of the Company with payments on a weekly basis and the full amount is expected to be repaid in 2024.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of March 31, 2023 was 4.5 years.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT** In accordance with ASC Topic 820 — _Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures_ (“ASC 820”), the Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business. ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: | ● | Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)  \n● | Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value)  \n  \nThe following table represents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON RECURRING BASIS\n\nMarch 31, 2024  \n---  \nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant derivative liabilities | $| — | $| — | $| 1,718,629 | $| 1,718,629  \nContingent consideration promissory notes and contingent consideration earn-out agreement | — | — | 94,235 | 94,235  \n$| — | $| — | $| 1,812,864 | $| 1,812,864  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant derivative liabilities | $| — | $| — | $| 1,369,738 | $| 1,369,738  \nContingent consideration promissory notes and contingent consideration earn-out agreement | — | — | 188,470 | 188,470  \n$| — | $| — | $| 1,558,208 | $| 1,558,208  \n  \nThe following table represents the change in Level 3 tier value measurements for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS CHANGE IN LEVEL 3 INPUTS\n\nContingent Consideration Promissory Notes and Earn-Out Agreement | Warrant Derivative Liabilities  \n---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | $| 188,470 | $| 1,369,738  \nIssuance of warrant derivative liabilities | — | —  \nChange in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities | — | 348,891  \nPrincipal payments on contingent consideration promissory notes – Revenue Cycle Management Acquisitions | (94,235| ) | —  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration promissory notes - Revenue Cycle Management Acquisitions | — | —  \nBalance, March 31, 2024 | $| 94,235 | $| 1,718,629  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

INCOME TAXES** The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 varied from the expected statutory rate due to the Company continuing to provide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2024, primarily because of the Company’s history of operating losses. The Company has incurred operating losses in recent years, and it continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position at March 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding its potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, it is determined to continue to provide a 100% valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The Company expects to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until it determines that it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize these assets. To the extent the Company determines that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. The Company has available to it approximately $140.9 million (based on its December 31, 2023 tax return) in net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income as of March 31, 2024.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

SEGMENT DATA** The accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or “CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s three operating segments are Video Solutions, Revenue Cycle Management, and Entertainment, each of which has specific personnel responsible for that business and reports to the CODM. Corporate expenses capture the Company’s corporate administrative activities, is also to be reported in the segment information. The Company’s captive insurance subsidiary provides services to the Company’s other business segments and not to outside customers. Therefore, its operations are eliminated in consolidation and is not considered a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes. The Video Solutions Segment encompasses our law, commercial, and Shield™ divisions. This segment includes both service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety solutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout the country, as a monthly service fee. The Entertainment Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing platform, ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the corporate line item. These activities primarily include expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, certain accounting staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, stock option expense for options granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses. Corporate identifiable assets primarily consist of cash, invested cash (if any), refundable income taxes (if any), and deferred income taxes.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY** **_2023 Issuance of Restricted Common Stock_** On January 10, 2023, the board of directors approved the grant of 22,500 shares of common stock to officers of the Company. Such shares will generally vest over a period of one to five years on their respective anniversary dates in January through January 2028, provided that each grantee remains an officer or employee on such dates. Additionally, the board of directors approved the grant of 12,500 restricted common shares to certain new employees of the Company. Such shares will generally vest over a period of one to two years on their respective anniversary dates in January through January 2025, provided that each grantee remains an employee of the company on such dates. **_2024 Issuance of Restricted Common Stock_** In January 2024, the board of directors approved the grant of 55,000 shares of common stock to officers of the Company. Such shares will generally vest over a period of one to five years on their respective anniversary dates in January through January 2028, provided that each grantee remains an officer or employee on such dates. Additionally, the board of directors approved the grant of 25,197 restricted common shares to certain new employees of the Company. Such shares will generally vest over a period of one to two years on their respective anniversary dates in January through January 2026, provided that each grantee remains an employee of the company on such dates. **_Cancellation of Restricted Stock_** During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company cancelled 1,125 shares due to termination of employee. **_Reverse Stock Split_** On February 6, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the shares of our common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of time of filing. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, our board approved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of our Common Stock, including, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split as if the split occurred as of the earliest period presented. The par value per share of our common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. **_Noncontrolling Interests_** The Company owns a 51% equity interest in its consolidated subsidiary, Nobility Healthcare. As a result, the noncontrolling shareholders or minority interest is allocated 49% of the income/loss of Nobility Healthcare which is reflected in the statement of (income) loss as “net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiary”. We reported net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiary of $12,248 and ($126,239) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION** The Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock issued of $40,695 and $114,848 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had adopted ten separate stock option and restricted stock plans: (i) the 2005 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2005 Plan”), (ii) the 2006 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), (iii) the 2007 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2007 Plan”), (iv) the 2008 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2008 Plan”), (v) the 2011 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2011 Plan”), (vi) the 2013 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2013 Plan”), (vii) the 2015 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”), (viii) the 2018 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2018 Plan”), (ix) the 2020 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2020 Plan”), and (x) the 2022 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”). The 2005 Plan, 2006 Plan, 2007 Plan, 2008 Plan, 2011 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2015 Plan, 2018 Plan, 2020 Plan and 2022 Plan are referred to as the “Plans.” These Plans permit the grant of stock options or restricted stock to its employees, non-employee directors and others for up to a total of 333,750 shares of common stock. The 2005 Plan terminated during 2015 with 1,078 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 total 284. The 2006 Plan terminated during 2016 with 2,739 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. Stock options granted under the 2006 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of March 31, 2024 total 531. The 2007 Plan terminated during 2017 with 4,733 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. There are no stock options granted under the 2007 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of March 31, 2024. The 2008 Plan terminated during 2018 with 2,025 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. There are no stock options granted under the 2008 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of March 31, 2024. **_Stock option grants._** The Company believes that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of its stockholders. Option awards have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of its stock at the date of grant with such option awards generally vesting based on the completion of continuous service and having ten-year contractual terms. These option awards typically provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the Plans). The Company has registered all shares of common stock that are issuable under its Plans with the SEC. A total of 137,042 shares remained available for awards under the various Plans as of March 31, 2024. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. A summary of all stock option activity under the Plans for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is as follows:  SUMMARY OF STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING | Options | **Number of** **Shares** | **Weighted** **Average** **Exercise Price**  \n---|---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 | 53,600 | $| 45.55  \nGranted | — | —  \nExercised | — | —  \nForfeited | — | —  \nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 | 53,600 | $| 45.55  \nExercisable at March 31, 2024 | 53,600 | $| 45.55  \n  \nThe Plans allow for the cashless exercise of stock options. This provision allows the option holder to surrender/cancel options with an intrinsic value equivalent to the purchase/exercise price of other options exercised. There were no shares surrendered pursuant to cashless exercises during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $-0- and $-0-, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable was $-0- and $-0-, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the unrecognized portion of stock compensation expense on all existing stock options was $-0-.\n\nThe following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable options under the Company’s option plans as of March 31, 2024: \n\nSCHEDULE OF SHARES AUTHORIZED UNDER STOCK OPTION PLANS BY EXERCISE PRICE RANGE\n\nOutstanding options | Exercisable options  \n---|---  \n**Exercise price** **range** | **Number of** **options** | **Weighted average remaining** **contractual life** | **Number of** **options** | **Weighted average** **remaining** **contractual life**  \n$| 0.01 to $49.99 | 37,000 | 6.4 years | 37,000 | 6.4 years  \n$| 50.00 to $69.99 | 15,100 | 4.2 years | 15,100 | 4.2 years  \n$| 70.00 to $89.99 | 1,500 | 2.1 years | 1,500 | 2.1 years  \n53,600 | 5.6 years | 53,600 | 5.6 years  \n  \n**_Restricted stock grants._** The Board of Directors has granted restricted stock awards under the Plans. Restricted stock awards are valued on the date of grant and have no purchase price for the recipient. Restricted stock awards typically vest over one to five years corresponding to anniversaries of the grant date. Under the Plans, unvested shares of restricted stock awards may be forfeited upon the termination of service to or employment with the Company, depending upon the circumstances of termination. Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of restricted stock, holders of unvested restricted stock have full stockholder’s rights, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends.\n\nA summary of all restricted stock activity under the Plans for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is as follows:\n\nSUMMARY OF RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY\n\n**Number of Restricted** **shares** | **Weighted** **average** **grant date fair value**  \n---|---  \nNonvested balance, December 31, 2023 | 53,875 | $| 11.27  \nGranted | 80,197 | 2.12  \nVested | (30,750| ) | 10.06  \nForfeited | (1,125| ) | 22.20  \nNonvested balance, March 31, 2024 | 102,197 | $| 4.34  \n  \nThe Company estimated the fair market value of these restricted stock grants based on the closing market price on the date of grant.

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS** **_2023 Purchase Warrants_** On April 5, 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock. The warrant terms provide for net cash settlement outside the control of the Company under certain circumstances. As such, the Company is required to treat these warrants as derivative liabilities which are valued at their estimated fair value at their issuance date and at each reporting date with any subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities. Furthermore, the Company re-values the fair value of warrant derivative liability as of the date the warrant is exercised with the resulting warrant derivative liability transitioned to change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities through the consolidated statement of operations. The Company has utilized the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the estimated fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities as of their date of issuance and as of March 31, 2024: SCHEDULE OF WARRANT MODIFICATION | Issuance date assumptions | March 31, 2024 assumptions  \n---|---  \nVolatility - range | 106.0| % | $| 108.5| %  \nRisk-free rate | 3.36| % | 4.21| %  \nDividend | 0| % | 0| %  \nRemaining contractual term | 5.0 years | 4.0 years  \nExercise price | 5.50 – 7.50 | 5.50 – 7.50  \nCommon stock issuable under the warrants | 1,125,000 | 1,125,000  \n  \nThe following table summarizes information about shares issuable under warrants outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nSUMMARY OF WARRANT ACTIVITY\n\nWarrants | Weighted average exercise price  \n---|---  \nVested Balance, December 31, 2023 | 1,125,000 | $| 6.50  \nGranted | — | —  \nExercised | — | —  \nForfeited/cancelled | — | —  \nVested Balance, March 31, 2024 | 1,125,000 | $| 6.50  \n  \nThe total intrinsic value of all outstanding warrants aggregated $-0- as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the weighted average remaining term was 48.2 months as of March 31, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable warrants to purchase shares of common stock as of March 31, 2024:\n\nSUMMARY OF RANGE OF EXERCISE PRICES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF WARRANTS \n\nOutstanding and exercisable warrants  \n---  \nExercise price | Number of warrants | Weighted average remaining contractual life  \n$| 5.50 | 375,000 | 4.0 years  \n$| 6.50 | 375,000 | 4.0 years  \n$| 7.50 | 375,000 | 4.0 years  \n1,125,000 | 4.0 years  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- Definition](javascript:void\\(0\\);)Common Stock Purchase Warrants [Text Block] [+ References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES** **_Litigation_** From time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose the specifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and assuming we determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against us. We record a liability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not probable, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time. On May 31, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit against Culp McAuley, Inc. (“defendant”) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The lawsuit arises from the defendant’s multiple breaches of its obligations to the Company. The Company seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief based on certain conduct by the defendant. On July 18, 2022, the defendant filed its Answer to the Company’s Verified Complaint and included Counterclaims alleging breach of contract and seeking monetary damages. On August 8, 2022, the Company filed its Reply and Affirmative Defenses to the Counterclaims by, among other things, denying the allegations and any and all liability. As of March 31, 2024, we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss related to the Culp McCauley case, our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) was approximately $1.8 million. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result, actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. While the ultimate resolution is unknown, based on the information currently available, we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. **_Notice of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule_** On March 14, 2024, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff notified Digital Ally, Inc. (the “Company”), that due to resignation of Mr. Michael J. Caulfield from the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) effective on January 31, 2024, the Company no longer complies with the audit committee and compensation committee requirements as set forth in Listing Rule 5605 of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), including the requirements that there are at least three independent directors on the Company’s audit committee and at least two independent directors on the Company’s compensation committee. The notification has no immediate effect on the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company is provided a cure period until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting (or July 29, 2024 if the next shareholders’ meeting will be held before July 29, 2024) or January 31, 2025 (the “Cure Period”). If the Company does not regain compliance by within the Cure Period, Nasdaq will provide written notice that the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, at which time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The management of the Company has resolved to take commercially reasonable steps to fill the vacancy on the Board with a new director who qualifies as independent under the Nasdaq Listing Rules as soon as is practical and anticipates regaining compliance during the Cure Period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

COUNTRY STAMPEDE ACQUISITION** On March 1, 2024, Kustom 440, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with JC Entertainment, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“JC Entertainment”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Kustom 440 acquired certain assets associated with a music entertainment event (“Country Stampede”), including all intellectual property arising out of and relating to Country Stampede (“Country Stampede Intellectual Property”) and certain contracts in which JC Entertainment is a party to host and operate the 2024 Country Stampede (the “Assumed Contracts”, and together with the Country Stampede Intellectual Property, the “Purchased Assets”). As consideration for acquiring the Purchased Assets, Kustom 440 paid JC Entertainment the aggregate purchase price amount $542,959, with the sum of $400,000 paid at the time of closing (“Closing”), and the remainder to be paid on or before thirty days from the time of Closing. Kustom 440 shall receive a credit for all non-refunded festival ticket sales for the 2024 Country Stampede to be calculated immediately prior to Closing, and JC Entertainment shall be entitled to keep all ticket sale proceeds made and/or received prior to Closing. Kustom 440 shall be obligated, to the extent a refund is sought after Closing, to provide such refund, if appropriate, to the customer requesting a refund, and shall indemnify and hold harmless JC Entertainment from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, suits, or the like relating to such refund request. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, the presentation of the assets acquired, historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, are not required to be presented. Under the acquisition method, the purchase price of the Country Stampede Acquisition has been allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the time of the Country Stampede Acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. The Country Stampede Acquisition was structured as an asset purchase; however the parties agreed to coordinate the election to invoke IRS Section 338(h)(10) relative to this transaction for tax purposes. Therefore, the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which will be amortized over 15 years for income tax filing purposes. Likewise, the other acquired assets were stepped up to fair value and is deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the Country Stampede Acquisition was allocated to tangible assets, goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values at the time of the acquisition. The Company retained the services of an independent valuation firm to determine the fair value of these identifiable intangible assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the fair value of the identified intangible assets. The preliminary estimated fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in the Country Stampede Acquisition were as follows: SCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ACQUISITION | As allocated  \n---  \nAs allocated(Preliminary)  \nDescription | **March 1, 2024**  \nAssets acquired (provisional):  \nTangible assets acquired | $| 305,000  \nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired (Trademarks and trade names) | 300,000  \nGoodwill | 225,959  \nLiabilities assumed | (288,000| )  \nLiabilities assumed pursuant to stock purchase agreement | (288,000| )  \nNet assets acquired and liabilities assumed | $| 542,959  \nConsideration:  \nCash paid at Country Stampede Acquisition date | $| 400,000  \nCash paid subsequent to closing | 142,959  \nTotal Country Stampede Acquisition purchase price | $| 542,959  \n  \nDuring the measurement period (which is the period required to obtain all necessary information that existed at the acquisition date, or to conclude that such information is unavailable, not to exceed one year), additional assets or liabilities may be recognized, or there could be changes to the amounts of assets or liabilities previously recognized on a preliminary basis, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of these assets or liabilities as of that date.   \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- Definition](javascript:void\\(0\\);)Line items represent financial concepts included in a table.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom, with Kustom continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing which is subject to the approval of Clover Leaf’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions, the common stock of the combined company is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name “Kustom Entertainment”.  \n[Basis of Presentation](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Basis of Presentation :** The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  \n[Liquidity and Going Concern](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Liquidity and Going Concern** During the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update provided U.S. GAAP guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. Under this standard, the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the Company’s financial statements were issued (May 15, 2023). Management considered the Company’s current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and the Company’s obligations due before May 15, 2024.  The Company has experienced net losses and cash outflows from operating activities since inception. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3,931,020, net cash used in operating activities of $918,545, $160,830 provided by investing activities and $1,005,027 provided by financing activities. The Company will have to restore positive operating cash flows and profitability over the next year and/or raise additional capital to fund its operational plans, meet its customary payment obligations and otherwise execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in restoring positive cash flows and profitability, or that it can raise additional financing when needed, and obtain it on terms acceptable or favorable to the Company.  The Company has implemented an enhanced quality control program to detect and correct product issues before they result in significant rework expenditures affecting its gross margins and has seen progress in that regard. The Company has also implemented a marketing and advertisement reduction plan for its entertainment segment, which will focus on reducing and alleviating current obligations from its media marketing agreements and place a hold on entering into any new agreements. The Company believes that its quality control, cost-cutting initiatives, and new product introduction will eventually restore positive operating cash flows and profitability, although it can offer no assurances in this regard. Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions described above in relation to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations and concluded that, without additional funding, the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.  \n[Basis of Consolidation](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Basis of Consolidation :** The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Digital Ally, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC, Digital Ally Healthcare, LLC, TicketSmarter, Inc., Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc., BirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated during consolidation. The Company formed Digital Ally International, Inc. during August 2009 to facilitate the export sales of its products. The Company formed Shield Products, LLC in May 2020 to facilitate the sales of its Shield™ line of disinfectant/cleanser products and ThermoVu™ line of temperature monitoring equipment. The Company formed Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”) in June 2021 to facilitate the operations of its revenue cycle management solutions and back-office services for healthcare organizations. The Company formed TicketSmarter, Inc. upon its acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, to facilitate its global ticketing operations. The Company formed Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd., which is a captive insurance company domiciled in Bermuda. It will provide primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace. The Company formed Kustom 440, Inc. in 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences directly for consumers, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc. in 2023 to serve as the participant in the Business Combination.  \n[Fair Value of Financial Instruments](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Fair Value of Financial Instruments :** The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and subordinated notes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.  \n[Revenue Recognition](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Revenue Recognition :** The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ , and all related appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to its customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has two different revenue streams, product and service, represented through its three segments. The Company reports all revenues on a gross basis, other than service revenues from the Company’s entertainment and revenue cycle management segments, Revenues generated by all segments are reported net of sales taxes. **_Video Solutions_** The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the customer. In situation where sales are to a distributor, the Company had concluded its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of part of its consideration for the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customers’ ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, it has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e. when the Company’s performance obligations is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. Further in determining whether control has been transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer. Customers do not have a right to return the product other than for warranty reasons for which they would only receive repair services or replacement products. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions for product sales when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year. Service and other revenue is comprised of revenues from extended warranties, repair services, cloud revenue and software revenue. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer for repair services. Revenue for extended warranty, cloud service or other software-based products is over the term of the contract warranty or service period. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to these revenues is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, as long as the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company’s multiple performance obligations may include future in-car or body-worn camera devices to be delivered at defined points within a multi-year contract, and in those arrangements, the Company allocates total arrangement consideration over the life of the multi-year contract to future deliverables using management’s best estimate of selling price. **_Revenue Cycle Management_** The Company reports revenue cycle management revenues on a net basis, as its primary source of revenue is its end-to-end service fees which is generally determined as a percentage of the invoice amounts collected. These service fees are reported as revenue monthly upon completion of the Company’s performance obligation to provide the agreed upon service. **_Entertainment_** The Company reports ticketing revenue on a gross or net basis based on management’s assessment of whether the Company is acting as a principal or agent in the transaction. The determination is based upon the evaluation of control over the event ticket, including the right to sell the ticket, prior to its transfer to the ticket buyer. The Company sells tickets held in inventory, which consists of one performance obligation, being to transfer control of an event ticket to the buyer upon confirmation of the order. The Company acts as the principal in these transactions as the ticket is owned by the Company at the time of sale, therefore controlling the ticket prior to transferring to the customer. In these transactions, revenue is recorded on a gross basis based on the value of the ticket and is recognized when an order is confirmed. Payment is typically due upon delivery of the ticket. The Company also acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers through online secondary marketplace. Revenues derived from this marketplace primarily consist of service fees from ticketing operations, and consists of one primary performance obligation, which is facilitating the transaction between the buyer and seller, being satisfied at the time the order has been confirmed. As the Company does not control the ticket prior to the transfer, the Company acts as an agent in these transactions. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, net of the amount due to the seller when an order is confirmed, the seller is then obligated to deliver the tickets to the buyer per the seller’s listing. Payment is due at the time of sale. **_Other_** Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $241,371 related to its contract liabilities. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. Total contract liabilities consist of the following: SCHEDULE OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES | March 31, 2024  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023 | Additions/Reclass | Recognized Revenue | March 31, 2024  \nContract liabilities, current | $| 2,937,168 | $| 535,598 | $| 173,052 | $| 3,299,714  \nContract liabilities, non-current | 7,340,459 | 13,066 | 68,319 | 7,285,206  \n$| 10,277,627 | $| 548,664 | $| 241,371 | $| 10,584,920  \nMarch 31, 2023  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2022 | Additions/Reclass | Recognized Revenue | March 31, 2023  \nContract liabilities, current | $| 2,154,874 | $| 562,809 | $| 92,813 | $| 2,624,870  \nContract liabilities, non-current | 5,818,082 | 868,211 | 370,646 | 6,315,647  \n$| 7,972,956 | $| 1,431,020 | $| 463,459 | $| 8,940,517  \n  \nSales returns and allowances aggregated $93,170 and $117,713 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Obligations for estimated sales returns and allowances are recognized at the time of sales on an accrual basis. The accrual is determined based upon historical return rates adjusted for known changes in key variables affecting these return rates.  \n  \n[Use of Estimates](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Use of Estimates :** The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to determining the estimated lives of long-lived assets, determining the potential impairment of long-lived assets, the fair value of warrants, options, the recognition of revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimate of fair value of the lease liabilities and related right of use asset, inventory valuation reserve, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, incremental borrowing rate on leases, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary.  \n[Cash and cash equivalents](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Cash and cash equivalents :** Cash and cash equivalents include funds on hand, in bank and short-term investments with original maturities of ninety (90) days or less. The following table shows the Company’s cash and cash equivalents by significant investment category as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023: SCHEDULE OF SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS | March 31, 2024  \n---  \nAdjusted Cost | Realized Gains | Realized Losses | Fair Value  \nDemand deposits | $| 769,982 | $| — | $| — | $| 769,982  \nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less (Level 1):  \nMoney market funds | 157,879 | — | — | 157,879  \n$| 927,861 | $| — | $| — | $| 927,861  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nAdjusted Cost | Realized Gains | Realized Losses | Fair Value  \nDemand deposits | $| 545,207 | $| — | $| — | $| 545,207  \nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less (Level 1):  \nMoney market funds | 135,342 | — | — | 135,342  \n$| 680,549 | $| — | $| — | $| 680,549  \n  \nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the uninsured balance amounted to $296,799 and $29,700, respectively.  \n  \n[Restricted Cash](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Restricted Cash :** Restricted cash of $97,600 and $97,600 was included in other assets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Restricted cash consists of bank deposits that collateralize our debt obligations. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows: SCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 927,861 | $| 680,549  \nLong-term restricted cash included in other assets | 97,600 | 97,600  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statements of cash flows | $| 1,025,461 | $| 778,149  \n[Accounts Receivable](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Accounts Receivable :** Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a weekly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. Trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. A trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than thirty (30) days beyond terms. No interest is charged on overdue trade receivables.  \n[Goodwill and Other Intangibles](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Goodwill and Other Intangibles :** _Goodwill_ - In connection with acquisitions, the Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, _Business Combinations_ , using the acquisition method of accounting. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, _Intangibles - Goodwill and Other_ , the Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or internally generated, are available to support the value of the goodwill. Traditionally, goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than zero and its fair value is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step two involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-04 which simplifies subsequent goodwill measurement by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As a result, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value and recognized an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the market approach. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on multiples of comparable public companies and precedent transactions. Significant estimates in the market approach include: identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. _Long-lived and Other Intangible Assets -_ The Company periodically assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, _Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets_. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company groups its assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities. The Company has determined that the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available is the operating segment level. Factors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends. When the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an impairment loss. An impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, based on the fair value if available, or discounted cash flows, if fair value is not available. The Company last assessed potential impairments of its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment. Subsequent to completing our 2023 annual impairment test, no events or changes in circumstances were noted that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Intangible assets include deferred patent costs, license agreements, trademarks and trade names. Legal expenses incurred in preparation of patent application have been deferred and will be amortized over the useful life of granted patents. Costs incurred in preparation of applications that are not granted will be charged to expense at that time. The Company has entered into several sublicense agreements under which it has been assigned the exclusive rights to certain licensed materials used in its products. These sublicense agreements generally require upfront payments to obtain the exclusive rights to such material. The Company capitalizes the upfront payments as intangible assets and amortizes such costs over their estimated useful life on a straight-line method.  \n[Segment Reporting](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Segment Reporting** The accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or “CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s three operating segments are Video Solutions, Revenue Cycle Management, and Entertainment, each of which has specific personnel responsible for that business and reports to the CODM. Corporate expenses capture the Company’s corporate administrative activities and are also to be reported in the segment information.  \n[Contingent Consideration](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Contingent Consideration** In circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments the Company expects to make as of the acquisition date. The Company remeasures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through the consolidated statement of operations.  \n[Non-Controlling Interests](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **Non-Controlling Interests** Non-controlling interests in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements represent the interest in subsidiaries held by our venture partner. The venture partner holds a noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. Since the Company consolidates the financial statements of all wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries, the noncontrolling owners’ share of each subsidiary’s results of operations are deducted and reported as net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  \n[New Accounting Standards](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | **New Accounting Standards** In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- Definition](javascript:void\\(0\\);)Contingent Consideration [Policy Text Block] [+ References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES** **Nature of Operations:** Digital Ally, Inc. was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. and had no operations until 2004. On November 30, 2004, Vegas Petra, Inc. entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., at which time the merged entity was renamed Digital Ally, Inc. (such merged entity, the “Predecessor Registrant”). On August 23, 2022 (the “Effective Time”), the Predecessor Registrant merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, DGLY Subsidiary Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant”), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 23, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), between the Predecessor Registrant and the Registrant, with the Registrant as the surviving corporation in the merger (such transaction, the “Merger”). At the Effective Time, Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, pursuant to which the Registrant was renamed “Digital Ally, Inc.” and, by operation of law, succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor Registrant immediately prior to the Merger. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, shareholder approval was not required in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) each outstanding share of Predecessor Registrant’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Predecessor Common Stock”) automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Registrant (“Registrant Common Stock”), (ii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of Predecessor Common Stock converted into an option, right or warrant, as applicable, to acquire an equal number of shares of Registrant Common Stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants, and (iii) the directors and executive officers of the Predecessor Registrant were appointed as directors and executive officers, as applicable, of the Registrant, each to serve in the same capacity and for the same term as such person served with the Predecessor Registrant immediately before the Merger. The business of the Registrant, Digital Ally, Inc. (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC, Digital Ally Healthcare, LLC (“Digital Ally Healthcare”), TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”), Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc., BirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc. (“Kustom 440”), Kustom Entertainment, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC, collectively, “Digital Ally,” “Digital,” and the “Company”), is divided into three reportable operating segments: 1) the Video Solutions Segment, 2) the Revenue Cycle Management Segment and 3) the Ticketing Segment. The Video Solutions Segment is our legacy business that produces digital video imaging, storage products, disinfectant and related safety products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. This segment includes both service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety solutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout the country, as a monthly service fee. The Entertainment Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing platform, ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Such required segment information is included in Note 18. **Reverse Stock Split** On February 6, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the shares of its common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of time of filing. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the board of directors of the Company approved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of the Company’s common stock, including, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout the Company’s consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split as if the split occurred as of the earliest period presented. The par value per share of the Company’s common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. **Business Combination** In June 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Nasdaq: CLOE) (“Clover Leaf”), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (“Merger Sub”), Yntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a Nevada corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies (“Kustom”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom, with Kustom continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing which is subject to the approval of Clover Leaf’s shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions, the common stock of the combined company is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name “Kustom Entertainment”. **Basis of Presentation :** The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the audited financial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. **Liquidity and Going Concern** During the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update provided U.S. GAAP guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. Under this standard, the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the Company’s financial statements were issued (May 15, 2023). Management considered the Company’s current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and the Company’s obligations due before May 15, 2024.  The Company has experienced net losses and cash outflows from operating activities since inception. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3,931,020, net cash used in operating activities of $918,545, $160,830 provided by investing activities and $1,005,027 provided by financing activities. The Company will have to restore positive operating cash flows and profitability over the next year and/or raise additional capital to fund its operational plans, meet its customary payment obligations and otherwise execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in restoring positive cash flows and profitability, or that it can raise additional financing when needed, and obtain it on terms acceptable or favorable to the Company.  The Company has implemented an enhanced quality control program to detect and correct product issues before they result in significant rework expenditures affecting its gross margins and has seen progress in that regard. The Company has also implemented a marketing and advertisement reduction plan for its entertainment segment, which will focus on reducing and alleviating current obligations from its media marketing agreements and place a hold on entering into any new agreements. The Company believes that its quality control, cost-cutting initiatives, and new product introduction will eventually restore positive operating cash flows and profitability, although it can offer no assurances in this regard. Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions described above in relation to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations and concluded that, without additional funding, the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within one year from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. **Basis of Consolidation :** The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Digital Ally, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC, Digital Ally Healthcare, LLC, TicketSmarter, Inc., Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc., BirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated during consolidation. The Company formed Digital Ally International, Inc. during August 2009 to facilitate the export sales of its products. The Company formed Shield Products, LLC in May 2020 to facilitate the sales of its Shield™ line of disinfectant/cleanser products and ThermoVu™ line of temperature monitoring equipment. The Company formed Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”) in June 2021 to facilitate the operations of its revenue cycle management solutions and back-office services for healthcare organizations. The Company formed TicketSmarter, Inc. upon its acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, to facilitate its global ticketing operations. The Company formed Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd., which is a captive insurance company domiciled in Bermuda. It will provide primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace. The Company formed Kustom 440, Inc. in 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences directly for consumers, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc. in 2023 to serve as the participant in the Business Combination. **Fair Value of Financial Instruments :** The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and subordinated notes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. **Revenue Recognition :** The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ , and all related appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to its customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has two different revenue streams, product and service, represented through its three segments. The Company reports all revenues on a gross basis, other than service revenues from the Company’s entertainment and revenue cycle management segments, Revenues generated by all segments are reported net of sales taxes. **_Video Solutions_** The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the customer. In situation where sales are to a distributor, the Company had concluded its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of part of its consideration for the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customers’ ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, it has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e. when the Company’s performance obligations is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. Further in determining whether control has been transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer. Customers do not have a right to return the product other than for warranty reasons for which they would only receive repair services or replacement products. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions for product sales when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year. Service and other revenue is comprised of revenues from extended warranties, repair services, cloud revenue and software revenue. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer for repair services. Revenue for extended warranty, cloud service or other software-based products is over the term of the contract warranty or service period. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to these revenues is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, as long as the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company’s multiple performance obligations may include future in-car or body-worn camera devices to be delivered at defined points within a multi-year contract, and in those arrangements, the Company allocates total arrangement consideration over the life of the multi-year contract to future deliverables using management’s best estimate of selling price. **_Revenue Cycle Management_** The Company reports revenue cycle management revenues on a net basis, as its primary source of revenue is its end-to-end service fees which is generally determined as a percentage of the invoice amounts collected. These service fees are reported as revenue monthly upon completion of the Company’s performance obligation to provide the agreed upon service. **_Entertainment_** The Company reports ticketing revenue on a gross or net basis based on management’s assessment of whether the Company is acting as a principal or agent in the transaction. The determination is based upon the evaluation of control over the event ticket, including the right to sell the ticket, prior to its transfer to the ticket buyer. The Company sells tickets held in inventory, which consists of one performance obligation, being to transfer control of an event ticket to the buyer upon confirmation of the order. The Company acts as the principal in these transactions as the ticket is owned by the Company at the time of sale, therefore controlling the ticket prior to transferring to the customer. In these transactions, revenue is recorded on a gross basis based on the value of the ticket and is recognized when an order is confirmed. Payment is typically due upon delivery of the ticket. The Company also acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers through online secondary marketplace. Revenues derived from this marketplace primarily consist of service fees from ticketing operations, and consists of one primary performance obligation, which is facilitating the transaction between the buyer and seller, being satisfied at the time the order has been confirmed. As the Company does not control the ticket prior to the transfer, the Company acts as an agent in these transactions. Revenue is recognized on a net basis, net of the amount due to the seller when an order is confirmed, the seller is then obligated to deliver the tickets to the buyer per the seller’s listing. Payment is due at the time of sale. **_Other_** Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $241,371 related to its contract liabilities. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied. Total contract liabilities consist of the following: SCHEDULE OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES | March 31, 2024  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023 | Additions/Reclass | Recognized Revenue | March 31, 2024  \nContract liabilities, current | $| 2,937,168 | $| 535,598 | $| 173,052 | $| 3,299,714  \nContract liabilities, non-current | 7,340,459 | 13,066 | 68,319 | 7,285,206  \n$| 10,277,627 | $| 548,664 | $| 241,371 | $| 10,584,920  \nMarch 31, 2023  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2022 | Additions/Reclass | Recognized Revenue | March 31, 2023  \nContract liabilities, current | $| 2,154,874 | $| 562,809 | $| 92,813 | $| 2,624,870  \nContract liabilities, non-current | 5,818,082 | 868,211 | 370,646 | 6,315,647  \n$| 7,972,956 | $| 1,431,020 | $| 463,459 | $| 8,940,517  \n  \nSales returns and allowances aggregated $93,170 and $117,713 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Obligations for estimated sales returns and allowances are recognized at the time of sales on an accrual basis. The accrual is determined based upon historical return rates adjusted for known changes in key variables affecting these return rates.\n\n**Use of Estimates :**\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to determining the estimated lives of long-lived assets, determining the potential impairment of long-lived assets, the fair value of warrants, options, the recognition of revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimate of fair value of the lease liabilities and related right of use asset, inventory valuation reserve, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, incremental borrowing rate on leases, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents :**\n\nCash and cash equivalents include funds on hand, in bank and short-term investments with original maturities of ninety (90) days or less. The following table shows the Company’s cash and cash equivalents by significant investment category as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nMarch 31, 2024  \n---  \nAdjusted Cost | Realized Gains | Realized Losses | Fair Value  \nDemand deposits | $| 769,982 | $| — | $| — | $| 769,982  \nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less (Level 1):  \nMoney market funds | 157,879 | — | — | 157,879  \n$| 927,861 | $| — | $| — | $| 927,861  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nAdjusted Cost | Realized Gains | Realized Losses | Fair Value  \nDemand deposits | $| 545,207 | $| — | $| — | $| 545,207  \nShort-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less (Level 1):  \nMoney market funds | 135,342 | — | — | 135,342  \n$| 680,549 | $| — | $| — | $| 680,549  \n  \nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the uninsured balance amounted to $296,799 and $29,700, respectively.\n\n**Restricted Cash :**\n\nRestricted cash of $97,600 and $97,600 was included in other assets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Restricted cash consists of bank deposits that collateralize our debt obligations.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 927,861 | $| 680,549  \nLong-term restricted cash included in other assets | 97,600 | 97,600  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statements of cash flows | $| 1,025,461 | $| 778,149  \n  \n**Accounts Receivable :**\n\nAccounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a weekly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions.\n\nTrade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. A trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than thirty (30) days beyond terms. No interest is charged on overdue trade receivables.\n\n**Goodwill and Other Intangibles :**\n\n_Goodwill_ - In connection with acquisitions, the Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, _Business Combinations_ , using the acquisition method of accounting. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, _Intangibles - Goodwill and Other_ , the Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or internally generated, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\n\nTraditionally, goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than zero and its fair value is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step two involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill. The Company has adopted ASU 2017-04 which simplifies subsequent goodwill measurement by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As a result, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value and recognized an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the reporting unit’s fair value.\n\nThe Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the market approach. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on multiples of comparable public companies and precedent transactions. Significant estimates in the market approach include: identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\n_Long-lived and Other Intangible Assets -_ The Company periodically assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, _Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets_. An impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company groups its assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities. The Company has determined that the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available is the operating segment level.\n\nFactors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends. When the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company recognizes an impairment loss. An impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, based on the fair value if available, or discounted cash flows, if fair value is not available. The Company last assessed potential impairments of its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment. Subsequent to completing our 2023 annual impairment test, no events or changes in circumstances were noted that required an interim goodwill impairment test.\n\nIntangible assets include deferred patent costs, license agreements, trademarks and trade names. Legal expenses incurred in preparation of patent application have been deferred and will be amortized over the useful life of granted patents. Costs incurred in preparation of applications that are not granted will be charged to expense at that time. The Company has entered into several sublicense agreements under which it has been assigned the exclusive rights to certain licensed materials used in its products. These sublicense agreements generally require upfront payments to obtain the exclusive rights to such material. The Company capitalizes the upfront payments as intangible assets and amortizes such costs over their estimated useful life on a straight-line method.\n\n**Segment Reporting**\n\nThe accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or “CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s three operating segments are Video Solutions, Revenue Cycle Management, and Entertainment, each of which has specific personnel responsible for that business and reports to the CODM. Corporate expenses capture the Company’s corporate administrative activities and are also to be reported in the segment information.\n\n**Contingent Consideration**\n\nIn circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments the Company expects to make as of the acquisition date. The Company remeasures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n**Non-Controlling Interests**\n\nNon-controlling interests in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements represent the interest in subsidiaries held by our venture partner. The venture partner holds a noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC. Since the Company consolidates the financial statements of all wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries, the noncontrolling owners’ share of each subsidiary’s results of operations are deducted and reported as net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n**New Accounting Standards**\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

          "content": "Digital Ally [Skip to main content](#content)\n\nMay 21 2024\n\n### Digital Ally, Inc Announces First Quarter 2024 Operating Results\n\nDigital Ally, Inc. (Nasdaq: DGLY) (the “Company” or “our”), today announced its operating results for the first quarter of 2024. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, 2024 (see details below).\n\n**_Highlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024_**\n\n● Overall gross profits for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $1,523,699, a slight decrease of $21,093, or 1%, as compared to $1,544,792 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The overall decrease is attributable to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 72% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our goal is to improve our margins over the longer term based on the expected margins generated by our new recent revenue cycle management and entertainment operating segments together with our video solutions operating segment and its expected margins from our EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, ShieldTM disinfectants and our cloud evidence storage and management offering, provided that they gain traction in the marketplace. In addition, if revenues from the video solutions segment increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from this segment through expansion and increased efficiency utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative to more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\n\n● Total revenues decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 to $5,529,351 from $7,697,190 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 a deterioration of $2,167,839 (28%). The primary reason for the overall revenue decrease is a decrease of $1,223,646 (44%) in service revenues in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 at the entertainment operating segment. Service and other revenues experienced a significant decrease during the three months ended March 31, 2024, in comparison to the same period in 2023, due to the Company’s focus to work towards profitability and focus on cash flow during the period. Additionally, the Company’s subscription plan model continues to gain traction in the marketplace, resulting in the Company building and recognizing its recurring revenues.\n\n● On September 1, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc., through which the Company completed the acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC (“Goody Tickets”) and TicketSmarter, LLC (“TicketSmarter”) (collectively the “TicketSmarter Acquisition”). Goody Tickets and TicketSmarter®, are ticket resale marketplaces with seats offered at over 125,000 live events, offering over 48 million tickets for sale through its TicketSmarter.com platform. Within this entertainment segment, the Company also formed Kustom 440, Inc. (“Kustom 440”) in late 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences through concerts, festivals, and private experiences. This segment generated revenues totaling $2,376,460 in service and product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1,8639,776, or (41%), as compared to $4,016,236 in service and product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is largely due to management’s focus on right-sizing the entertainment segment, and working towards profitability; thus, decreasing marketing expenses, directly correlating to a decrease in revenues.\n\n● We remain in the revenue cycle management business through the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company. On January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a private dental billing company. Additionally, on February 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare also completed an asset purchase for a portfolio of a medical billing company. These acquisitions further enhanced the Company’s revenue cycle management operating segment, which provides revenue cycle management solutions to medium to large healthcare organizations throughout the country. The compilation of acquisitions generated service revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of $1,434,598, a decrease of $346,992, or (19%), as compared to $1,781,590 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\n● Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $5,162,733, a decrease of $2,554,865, or (33%), as compared to $7,717,598 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company.\n\n● On March 1, 2024, Kustom 440, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with JC Entertainment, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“JC Entertainment”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Kustom 440 acquired certain assets associated with a music entertainment event (“Country Stampede”), including all intellectual property arising out of and relating to Country Stampede and certain contracts in which JC Entertainment is a party to host and operate the 2024 Country Stampede.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n● In June 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Nasdaq: CLOE) (“Clover Leaf”), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (“Merger Sub”), Yntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a Nevada corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies (“Kustom Entertainment”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom Entertainment, with Kustom Entertainment continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing, which is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions (including the approval of Clover Leaf’s shareholders), the common stock of the combined company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name “Kustom Entertainment.”\n\nIn May 2024, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of Amendment No. 4 to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC on May 13, 2024, relating to the previously announced proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf.\n\n● On April 5, 2024, the “Company, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada an Elimination of Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Elimination Certificate”) and Elimination of Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series B Elimination Certificate”) in order to eliminate and cancel all designations, rights, preferences and limitations of the shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). In December 2022, all 1,400,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that had originally been issued pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series A Certificate of Designations”) and all 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that had originally been issued pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series B Certificate of Designations”) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Series A Elimination Certificate, none of the 1,400,000 authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock or 100,000 authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and no shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock were to be issued subject to the Series A Certificate of Designations or Series B Certificate of Designations. The Series A Elimination Certificate and Series B Elimination Certificate became effective upon their filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada\n\n● In April 2024, the Company received additional advances of $444,000 from the lender and agreed to new terms where total proceeds received since inception totaled $2,144,000. The Company will repay an aggregate of $2,880,000 to the lender. The advances remain secured by expected future sales of the Company with payments on a weekly basis and the full amount is expected to be repaid in 2024.\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nStanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We are very pleased to keep our momentum from the end of 2023 into the first quarter of 2024, with greatly improved gross profits compared to the first quarter of 2023, showing the continued success of our focus on margins and working towards profitability. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the EVO-HD, FirstVu Pro, and QuickVu docking stations, which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance reach $10.6 million at March 31, 2024, as our balance grew considerably by about $1.7 million from $8.9 million at March 31, 2023. There is additional excitement about new upcoming product releases and additional patent filings that will continue to display our commitment to innovation and success within our video solutions operating segment. We continue to see continued success in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maintain profitability throughout that segment.”\n\nRoss added: “Additionally, we are very excited about the latest filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4/A by Clover Leaf with the SEC relating to the proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf Capital Corp. to create Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a company with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies. We expect that this business combination will provide clarity to both shareholder as well as the marketplace, showing two distinct, stand-alone entities, Digital Ally and Kustom Entertainment, further, we remain excited about the organic growth opportunities with the Kustom 440 subsidiary along with the recent acquisition of Country Stampede, a prestigious festival within the Midwest.

(53) the risk that Kustom Entertainment is not able to maintain and enhance its brand and reputation in its marketplace, adversely affecting Kustom Entertainment’s business, financial condition and results of operations; (54) the risk of the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, disease epidemics or pandemics, severe weather events and natural disasters; (55) the risk that because Kustom Entertainment’s operations are seasonal and its results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, its financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, Kustom Entertainment’s financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years; (56) the risk that periods of rapid growth and expansion could place a significant strain on Kustom Entertainment’s resources, including its employee base, which could negatively impact Kustom Entertainment’s operating results; (57) the risk that Kustom Entertainment may never achieve or sustain profitability; (58) the risk that Kustom Entertainment may need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which many not be available on acceptable terms or at all;

          "content": "[Skip to main content](#content)\n\nApr 2 2024\n\n### DIGITAL ALLY, INC ANNOUNCES 2023 OPERATING RESULTS\n\n**Digital Ally, Inc. (Nasdaq: DGLY) (the “Company” or “our”),** today announced its operating results for fiscal year 2023. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 2, 2024 (see details below).\n\n**Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023**\n\n● Overall gross profits for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $5,762,484, an increase of $3,440,543, or 148%, as compared to $2,321,941 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The overall increase is attributable to the consistent focus on the cost of goods sold, particularly surrounding the Entertainment Segment, as well as the enhanced margins within the video solutions segment, with its new and expanded product offerings. Our goal is to continue to improve our margins over the longer term based on the expected margins generated by our new operating segments together with continued enhancements within our video solutions segment and its expected margins from our EVO-Fleet, EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, InterVu Room, Shield disinfectants and our cloud evidence storage and management offerings, as they gain traction in the marketplace. In addition, if revenues from the video solutions segment increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from this segment through expansion and increased efficiency utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative for more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\n\n● Total revenues decreased in 2023 to $28,248,344 from $37,009,895 in 2022 a deterioration of $8,761,551 (24%). The primary reason for the overall revenue decrease is a decrease of $6,253,892 (41%) in service revenues from 2022 levels at the entertainment operating segment. Service and other revenues experienced a significant decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023, in comparison to the same period in 2022, due to the Company’s focus to work towards profitability and focus on cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company’s subscription plan model continues to gain traction in the marketplace, resulting in the Company building and recognizing its recurring revenues.\n\n● On September 1, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc., through which the Company completed the acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC (“Goody Tickets”) and TicketSmarter, LLC (“TicketSmarter”) (collectively the “TicketSmarter Acquisition”). Goody Tickets and TicketSmarter®, are ticket resale marketplaces with seats offered at over 125,000 live events, offering over 48 million tickets for sale through its TicketSmarter.com platform. Within this Entertainment Segment, the Company also formed Kustom 440, Inc. (“Kustom 440”) in late 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences through concerts, festivals, and private experiences. This segment generated revenues totaling $14,063,381 in service and product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $6,808,119, or (33%), as compared to $20,871,500 in service and product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is largely due to management’s focus on right-sizing the entertainment segment, and working towards profitability; thus, decreasing marketing expenses, directly correlating to a decrease in revenues.\n\n● We remain in the revenue cycle management business through the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company. On January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a private dental billing company. Additionally, on February 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare also completed an asset purchase for a portfolio of a medical billing company. These acquisitions further enhanced the Company’s revenue cycle management operating segment, which provides revenue cycle management solutions to medium to large healthcare organizations throughout the country. The compilation of acquisitions generated service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $6,713,678, a decrease of $1,172,429, or (15%), as compared to $7,886,107 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n● Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $28,003,037, a decrease of $4,052,162, or (13%), as compared to $32,055,199 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n● In June 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Nasdaq: CLOE) (“Clover Leaf”), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (“Merger Sub”), Yntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a Nevada corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies (“Kustom Entertainment”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom Entertainment, with Kustom Entertainment continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing, which is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions (including the approval of Clover Leaf’s shareholders), the common stock of the combined company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name “Kustom Entertainment.”\n\nIn February 2024, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of Amendment No. 2 to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC on February 5, 2024, relating to the previously announced proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf.\n\n● On March 1, 2024, Kustom 440, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with JC Entertainment, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“JC Entertainment”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Kustom 440 acquired certain assets associated with a music entertainment event (“Country Stampede”), including all intellectual property arising out of and relating to Country Stampede (“Country Stampede Intellectual Property”) and certain contracts in which JC Entertainment is a party to host and operate the 2024 Country Stampede (the “Assumed Contracts”, and together with the Country Stampede Intellectual Property, the “Purchased Assets”).\n\n● On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Agreement”), by and between the Company, Kustom Entertainment (together with the Company, the “Borrowers”), and Mosh Man, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Borrowers issued to the Purchaser a Senior Secured Promissory Note (the “Note”) with a principal amount of $1,425,000. In connection with the Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”) by and between the Borrowers, as grantor, and the Purchaser, as grantee. The gross proceeds to the Company are $1,000,000, before paying customary fees and expenses.\n\nPursuant to the Note, the Borrowers shall repay the Note, in full, on the earlier of (i) November 1, 2024, and (ii) the consummation of the merger between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf pursuant to the Merger Agreement among the Company, Kustom Entertainment, Clover Leaf, Yntegra Capital Investments LLC and Merger Sub, dated as of June 1, 2023. The Borrowers shall pay in arrears in cash an amount equal to 50% of revenues from all ticket sales generated by Kustom Entertainment, up nine thousand tickets sold, and thereafter equal to 10% of all revenues from all ticket sales until the earlier of the date on which the Note is repaid in full or the Maturity Date. The Note bears interest at a rate of 1.58% per month. The Borrowers have the right, but not the obligation, under the Note to prepay the Note, upon written notice to the Purchaser, by payment in full of the entire outstanding principal balance plus interest. Upon a change of control of either Borrower or a sale or all or substantially all of either Borrower’s assets, the Purchaser may require the Borrowers to repay the Note, upon written notice to the Borrowers, by payment in full of the entire outstanding principal balance plus interest. In addition, upon the receipt of proceeds from any financing or extraordinary receipts, the Borrowers are required to repay the Note as follows: (A) if the aggregate proceeds of all such financings and extraordinary receipts are less than $3,000,000, the Borrowers shall prepay an amount equaling to 50% of the outstanding principal of the Note, and (B) if the aggregate proceeds of all such financings and extraordinary receipts are equal to or greater than $3,000,000, the Borrowers shall prepay the Note in full.\n\nPursuant to the Security Agreement, the Borrowers’ obligations under the Note and Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers, other than any real property.\n\n● On March 14, 2024, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff notified the Company, that due to resignation of Mr. Michael J. Caulfield from the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) effective on January 31, 2024, the Company no longer complies with the audit committee and compensation committee requirements as set forth in Listing Rule 5605 of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), including the requirements that there are at least three independent directors on the Company’s audit committee and at least two independent directors on the Company’s compensation committee.\n\nThe notification has no immediate effect on the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company is provided a cure period until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting (or July 29, 2024 if the next shareholders’ meeting will be held before July 29, 2024) or January 31, 2025 (the “Cure Period”). If the Company does not regain compliance by within the Cure Period, Nasdaq will provide written notice that the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, at which time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\n\nThe management of the Company has resolved to take commercially reasonable steps to fill the vacancy on the Board with a new director who qualifies as independent under the Nasdaq Listing Rules as soon as is practical and anticipates regaining compliance during the Cure Period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nStanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We are very pleased to close out another great year in 2023, with greatly improved gross profits compared to 2022, showing the success of our focus of margins and working towards profitability. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the EVO-HD, FirstVu Pro, and QuickVu docking stations, which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance reach $10.3 million, as our balance grew dramatically by about $2.3 million from less than $8.0 million at December 31, 2022. There is additional excitement about new upcoming product releases and additional patent filings that will continue to display our commitment to innovation and success within our video solutions operating segment. We continue to see continued success in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maintain profitability of the four completed acquisitions.”\n\nRoss added: “Additionally, we are very excited about the 2022 filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC relating to the proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf Capital Corp. to create Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a company with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies. We expect that this business combination will provide clarity to both shareholder as well as the marketplace, showing two distinct, stand-alone entities, Digital Ally and Kustom Entertainment, Further, we remain excited about the organic growth opportunities with the Kustom 440 subsidiary. Kustom 440 hosted its first festival during 2023, in Kansas City at Legends Field, headlining Chris Young and Gabby Barrett. We are also thrilled about the recent launch of KustomTicket.com, an advanced online ticketing platform, right alongside our recently completed acquisition of Country Stampede that marks a significant milestone for Kustom Entertainment, solidifying its presence and influence in the entertainment industry. We will continue to inform our investors as we move forward with the business combination, alongside our continuous efforts to take advantage of new business opportunities and to maximize our existing business lines to benefit the Company and its shareholders through 2024 and beyond.”\n\n**2023 Operating Results**\n\nOverall gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5,762,484 and $2,321,941, respectively, an increase of $3,440,543 (148%).

(54) the risk of the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, disease epidemics or pandemics, severe weather events and natural disasters; (55) the risk that because Kustom Entertainment’s operations are seasonal and its results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, its financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, Kustom Entertainment’s financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years;

(Nasdaq: DGLY) (the œCompany or œour),** which develops, manufactures, and markets advanced video recording products and other critical safety products for law enforcement, emergency management, fleet safety and event security, today announced a notable milestone with its deferred revenue balance exceeding $10 million for the first time in the Company™s history.\n\nThe Company™s switch to a subscription program model in mid-2020 has proven to be a great success and widely accepted in the industry as adequate funding for many municipalities can be a rigorous and slow process. The subscription model minimizes their upfront capital expenditure and allows flexibility for the customer based on their current financial situation, without having to sacrifice their urgency for video evidence technology.\n\nœWe™re proud to announce another great milestone for the Company, as we continue to build momentum throughout the marketplace and compile a robust customer base taking advantage of our subscription model. Surpassing $10 million is a great feat for the Company, with nearly 300 customers currently utilizing our subscription plans throughout the country, said Brody Green, President of Digital Ally, adding, œBy no means does this satisfy our management team, as we fully expect these numbers to continue to grow alongside our market share within this industry and others. We are excited about the forward progress being made, and this milestone shows the potential and future growth the Company will have as it becomes disciplined and attentive moving forward.\n\nThe milestone comes on the heels of the Company™s recent filing of the S-4/A Registration Statement Amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the announcement of several notable law enforcement orders and patents, as well as the addition of its InterVu Room solution. Digital Ally continues to demonstrate its commitment to innovation and a world-class video solutions ecosystem with the FirstVu Pro body-worn camera, EVO-HD in-car system, InterVu Room system, EVO Web and QuickVu docking stations.\n\n**About Digital Ally**\n\nDigital Ally, Inc. (NASDAQ: DGLY) through its subsidiaries, is engaged in video solution technology, human & animal health protection products, healthcare revenue cycle management, ticket brokering and marketing, event production and jet chartering. Digital Ally continues to add organizations that demonstrate the common traits of positive earnings, growth potential, innovation and organizational synergies.\n\nFor additional news and information please visit [ _www.digitalally.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JoQwSiQfHZV7wLlMX4fgej1Mao55he__TxKvj9j1WvaAYvSwq0cgs3aPxlnAdYep3LYEu2IzN9LfpwcyHCyoLccBi0VnZbM2fQfSNTpnl9E=) or follow Digital Ally Inc. social media channels here:\n\n[Facebook](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0rHtyOUgiplGuGqaCWTpc7btYhtv8JMBjIxad-v8of3jboBboKc7ncFYjKxbXkUroVrxFwSJ3aW_NGumxNte86U_d_Y-Tw-h4lBtISIeucs= \"Facebook\") | [Instagram](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vmCGS1H5fgHR2MXy3RM8pbzXtb0b37DG9v36vLYlWuugPD_oY8fDoHvNEod7XSY2JqaQRPhkRA2PzD6TMd56Y-OvhvzHhAhQwnx9Cy56_vx1AUIQHeBw7wCYJkxlXh47 \"Instagram\") | [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-_bNq-b0Rm0QrZ5Q1h935agcnWeY4uQVMEoRmtBzJoeytjiQCjfM6KGFjY9hdr6acXt2AYt1AqT2xNsZx33x1NDbvlXtbpGAo3Nn_sait8k= \"LinkedIn\") | [Twitter](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z7XWJ48H_OO_9PvD6gGU7lWa6xlrV4eRTT6dPYXoHdNJqVhZj3h6cd79QEo8zHY5G9VM2t8ALnBlbORirzWlfu_xTYFokGl0ACPOVBKl85A= \"Twitter\")\n\n**Contact Information** Brody Green, President Stanton Ross, CEO Tom Heckman, CFO Digital Ally, Inc. 913-814-7774 [_info@digitalallyinc.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OPAjYKXDrKX2SnbtSCFS3yAu1UtyKD7GeUisPILqVoufYV4XKM_csDAt9BQ-34xynGXEcFnbX5Zu9U8yksfqDxtlirlwhdShCyCaR-lHAAE=)\n\n**Forward Looking Statement**\n\n_This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934.

          "content": "[Skip to main content](#content)\n\nNov 15 2023\n\n### Digital Ally, Inc Announces Third Quarter 2023 Operating Results\n\n**Digital Ally, Inc. (Nasdaq: DGLY) (the œCompany or œour),** today announced its operating results for the third quarter 2023. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, November 15, 2023 (see details below).\n\nAll share and price per share information in this press release has been adjusted to reflect the Company™s 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective on February 6, 2023.\n\n**_Highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023_**\n\n  * _Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $6,337,699, a decrease of $2,146,454, or (25%), as compared to $8,484,153 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Overall product revenues were $2,095,237 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $967,136, or (32%), as compared to $3,062,373 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in product revenues for the period is attributable to the Entertainment Segment™s (the œEntertainment Segment) efforts to reduce expenses and maximize their margins, thus leading to a significant decrease in product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months in September 30, 2022. Service and other revenues also experienced a decline during the three months ended September 30, 2023, in comparison to the same period in 2022, due to a reduction in marketing expenses within the Entertainment Segment, that resulted in a correlating decline in service revenues for the period. The primary reason for the overall revenue decrease is a decrease of $876,542, or (33%), in service revenues from 2022 levels at the Entertainment Segment, due to the reduction in marketing expenses within the Entertainment Segment throughout the period._\n\n\n  * _On September 1, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc., through which the Company completed the acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC (œGoody Tickets) and TicketSmarter, LLC (œTicketSmarter) (collectively the œTicketSmarter Acquisition). Goody Tickets and TicketSmarter®, are ticket resale marketplaces with seats offered at over 125,000 live events, offering over 48 million tickets for sale through its TicketSmarter.com platform. Within this Entertainment Segment, the Company also formed Kustom 440, Inc. (œKustom 440) in late 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences through concerts, festivals, and private experiences. This segment generated additional revenues totaling $2,903,808 in service and product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $1,472,306, or (34%), as compared to $4,376,114 in service and product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease is largely due to management™s focus on right-sizing the Entertainment Segment, and working towards profitability; thus, decreasing marketing expenses, directly correlating to a decrease in revenues._\n\n\n  * _We entered the revenue cycle management business late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (œNobility Healthcare). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company. On January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a private dental billing company. Additionally, on February 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare also completed an asset purchase for a portfolio of a medical billing company. These acquisitions further enhanced the Company™s Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment (the œRevenue Cycle Management Operating Segment), which provides revenue cycle management solutions to medium to large healthcare organizations throughout the country. These acquisitions, along with the Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment™s acquisitions that were previously completed in 2021, generated service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of $1,636,543, a decrease of $378,569, or (19%), as compared to $2,015,112 for the three months ended September 30, 2022._\n\n\n  * _Our healthcare venture is following a roll-up strategy in the medical billing industry. The venture™s acquisition targets include the approximate 6,000 medical billing companies in the United States, most of which are relatively small and closely-held private companies. Each year a portion of these company owners sell because they want to retire or exit the business for other pursuits. The Company saw the opportunity to form the venture and provide the capital to make acquisitions and pursue the medical billing company roll-up strategy at a faster pace. We expect our healthcare venture to continue its track record of providing superior medical billing services and practice management services, as well as executing a profitable roll-up strategy._\n\n\n  * _Overall gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $1,595,500, an increase of $630,649, or 106%, as compared to $595,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The overall increase is attributable to the consistent focus on the cost of goods sold, particularly surrounding the Entertainment Segment, as well as the enhanced margins within the Video Solutions Segment (the œVideo Solutions Segment), with its newer product offerings. Our goal is to improve our margins over the longer term based on the expected margins generated by our new recent Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment and Entertainment Segment together with our Video Solutions Segment and its expected margins from our EVO-Fleet, EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, Shield disinfectants and our cloud evidence storage and management offerings, as they gain traction in the marketplace. In addition, if revenues from the Video Solutions Segment increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from this segment through expansion and increased efficiency utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative to more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices._\n\n\n  * _Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $6,374,192, a decrease of $788,331, or (11%), as compared to $7,162,523 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company._\n\n\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * _In June 2023, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the œMerger Agreement) with Clover Leaf Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (Nasdaq: CLOE) (œClover Leaf), CL Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf (œMerger Sub), Yntegra Capital Investments LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the stockholders of Clover Leaf in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a Nevada corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies (œKustom). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the œClosing), Merger Sub will merge with and into Kustom, with Kustom continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Clover Leaf. Upon the Closing, which is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions (including the approval of Clover Leaf™s shareholders), the common stock of the combined company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under a mutually agreed new ticker symbol that reflects the name œKustom Entertainment._\n\n\n  * _In October 2023, Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf announced the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC on October 4, 2023, relating to the previously announced proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf._\n\n\n  * _On October 17, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the œBoard) appointed D. Duke Daughtery as a member of the Board, effective immediately, to hold office until the next meeting of shareholders of the Company at which directors are being elected or as set forth in the Company™s bylaws._\n\n\n  * _On October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the œLoan Agreement) by and between the Company, Digital Ally Healthcare (together with the Company, the œBorrower), and Kompass Kapital Funding, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (œKompass). In connection with the Loan Agreement, on October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (the œMortgage) by and between the Company, as grantor, and Kompass, as grantee, and issued a Revolving Note (the œRevolving Note) to Kompass. The gross proceeds to the Company are $4,880,000 before repaying those certain Senior Secured Convertible Notes issued on April 5, 2023 in the aggregate amount of $3,162,500 and paying customary fees and expenses._\n\n\n  * _Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, Kompass agreed to make the revolving loans (the œRevolving Loans) available to the Borrower as the Borrower may from time to time request until, but not including, October 26, 2025, and in such amounts as the Borrower may from time to time request, provided, however, that the aggregate principal balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of $4,880,000.00 or an amount equal to eighty percent of the value of the mortgaged property, which consists of the real property owned by the Company (the œMortgaged Property). Under the Loan Agreement, the Revolving Loans made by Kompass may be repaid and, subject to customary terms and conditions, borrowed again up to, but not including October 26, 2025, unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise accelerated, terminated or extended as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall be used by the Borrower for the purpose of working capital and to retire existing debt. Under the Loan Agreement, the borrower is required to provide written notice to Kompass prior to creating, assuming or incurring any debt or becoming liable, whether as endorser, guarantor, surety or otherwise, for any debt or obligation of any other party. While obligations remain outstanding under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to maintain a minimum balance of $97,600 in a reserve account. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is prohibited from creating, assuming, incurring or suffering or permitting to exist any lien of any kind or character upon the collateral, which consists of the Mortgaged Property and the Company™s interest in the Capital Reserve Account. The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties by the Borrower._\n\n\n  * _Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company issued the Revolving Note to Kompass whereby the Company and Digital Ally Healthcare jointly and severally promise to pay to the order of Kompass the lesser of (i) $4,880,000.00, or (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding under and pursuant to the Loan Agreement at the maturity or maturities and in the amount or amounts stated on the records of Kompass, together with interest (computed on the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a 360 day year) at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus four percent or (ii) eight percent, on the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time as provided in the Loan Agreement._\n\n\n  * _The Company entered into the Mortgage to secure its obligations under the Loan Agreement. The property mortgaged under the Mortgage consists of the Mortgaged Property. The Mortgage contains customary covenants, representations and warranties by the Company._\n\n\n\n**Management Comments**\n\nStanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally, stated, œWe are very pleased to report over $6.3 million in quarterly revenues for the third quarter of 2023, along with greatly improved gross profits compared to the third quarter of 2022. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the EVO-HD, FirstVu Pro, and QuickVu docking stations, which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance approaching the $10 million mark, as our contract liabilities went from approximately $7.2 million at September 30, 2022, to nearly $9.9 million at September 30, 2023. We continue to build excitement around the momentum being gained in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maximize the profitability of the four completed acquisitions. The numerous medical billing company acquisitions that we have already completed demonstrate our roll-up strategy is effective and attractive to potential targets. We look forward to seeing the growth potential of this venture come to fruition and continue throughout 2023 and beyond.\n\nRoss added: œAdditionally, we are very excited about the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 by Clover Leaf with the SEC relating to the proposed business combination between Kustom Entertainment and Clover Leaf Capital Corp. to create Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a company with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies. We expect that this business combination will provide clarity to both shareholder as well as the marketplace, showing two distinct, stand-alone entities, Digital Ally and Kustom Entertainment, Further, we remain excited about the organic growth opportunities with the Kustom 440 subsidiary. Kustom 440 hosted its first festival during 2023, in Kansas City at Legends Field, headlining Chris Young and Gabby Barrett. We were very pleased with the results of the show and the turn-out for this event and look forward to announcing more shows in the near future. We will continue to inform our investors as we move forward with the business combination, alongside our continuous efforts to take advantage of new business opportunities and to maximize our existing business lines to benefit the Company and its shareholders through 2023 and beyond.\n\n**2023 Operating Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $6,337,699 and $8,484,153, respectively, a decrease of $2,146,454 (25%).\n\nOverall gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $1,226,149 and $595,500, respectively, an increase of $630,649 (106%). The overall increase is attributable to the Entertainment Segment reaching profitability for the three months ended September 30, 2023 along with a sustained gross profit within the Video Solutions Segment and Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment. Further, a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 81% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 93% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 also contributed to improved gross profits.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $6,374,192 and $7,162,523 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $788,331 (11%). The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company.\n\nWe reported an operating loss of $5,148,043 and $6,567,023 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an improvement of $1,418,980 (22%).\n\nTotal other income decreased to $1,469,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to total other income of $4,647,952 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in other income was largely attributable to the gain on the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities of $1,863,326 and interest expenses of $959,898 associated with the April 5, 2023 Purchase Agreement, both incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to other income of $1,164,849 related to the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities and a gain on the extinguishment of warrants derivative liabilities of $3,624,794 during the three months ended September 30, 2022.\n\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3,708,673, or $1.32 per share, and $1,902,475, or $0.76 per share, for the years three months September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in either 2023 or 2022 as the Company has maintained a full valuation reserve on its deferred tax assets.\n\n**Investor Conference Call**\n\n**The Company will host an investor conference call at 11:15 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, November 15, 2023, to discuss its third quarter 2023 financial results, corporate and individual subsidiary outlook, and previously announced corporate separation. Shareholders and other interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing 888-886-7786 and entering conference ID #73514221 a few minutes before 11:15 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, November 15, 2023.**\n\n**Additional Information and Where to Find It**\n\nIn connection with the business combination between Clover Leaf and Kustom Entertainment (the œBusiness Combination), Clover Leaf has filed a proxy statement and registration statement on Form S-4 (the œProxy/Registration Statement) with the SEC (as defined herein), which includes a proxy statement to be distributed to holders of Clover Leaf™s common stock in connection with Clover Leaf™s solicitation of proxies for the vote by Clover Leaf™s stockholders with respect to the Business Combination and other matters as described in the Proxy/Registration Statement, as well as, a prospectus relating to the offer of the securities to be issued to Kustom Entertainment™s stockholder in connection with the Business Combination.

(54) the risk of the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, disease epidemics or pandemics, severe weather events and natural disasters; (55) the risk that because Kustom Entertainment™s operations are seasonal and its results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, its financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, Kustom Entertainment™s financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years; (56) the risk that periods of rapid growth and expansion could place a significant strain on Kustom Entertainment™s resources, including its employee base, which could negatively impact Kustom Entertainment™s operating results; (57) the risk that Kustom Entertainment may never achieve or sustain profitability; (58) the risk that Kustom Entertainment may need to raise additional capital to execute its business plan, which many not be available on acceptable terms or at all;

(Nasdaq: DGLY) (the œCompany or œour)** , today announced its operating results for the second quarter 2023. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, August 15, 2023 (see details below).\n\nAll share and price per share information in this press release has been adjusted to reflect the Company™s 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective on February 6, 2023.\n\n**Highlights for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023**\n\nâ— _Total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $8,279,632, a decrease of $1,071,826, or (11%), as compared to $9,351,458 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Overall product revenues were $3,077,661 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a increase of $867,480, or (39%), as compared to $2,210,181 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in product revenues for the period is attributable to the Entertainment Segment™s completion of its first music festival, Country Roots Festival in May. Service and other revenues also experienced a decline during the three months ended June 30, 2023, in comparison to the same period in 2022, due to a reduction in marketing expenses within the Entertainment segment, that resulted in a correlating decline in service revenues for the period. The primary reason for the overall revenue decrease is a decrease of $1,648,813, or (38%), in service revenues from 2022 levels at the Entertainment Segment, due to the reduction in ticket purchases within the Entertainment segment throughout the period._\n\n_â— On September 1, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc., through which the Company completed the acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC (œGoody Tickets) and TicketSmarter, LLC (œTicketSmarter) (collectively the œTicketSmarter Acquisition). Goody Tickets and TicketSmarter®, are ticket resale marketplaces with seats offered at over 125,000 live events, offering over 48 million tickets for sale through its TicketSmarter.com platform. Within this Entertainment Segment, the Company also formed Kustom 440, Inc. in late 2022 to create unique entertainment experiences through concerts, festivals, and private experiences. This segment generated additional revenues totaling $4,655,270 in service and product revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $525,693, or (10%), as compared to $5,180,963 in service and product revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease is largely due to management™s focus on right-sizing the Entertainment Segment, and work towards profitability; thus, decreasing marketing expenses, directly correlating to a decrease in revenues._\n\n_â— We entered the revenue cycle management business late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (œNobility Healthcare). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company. On January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a private dental billing company. Additionally, on February 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare also completed an asset purchase for a portfolio of a medical billing company. These acquisitions further enhanced the Company™s revenue cycle management operating segment, which provides revenue cycle management solutions to medium to large healthcare organizations throughout the country. These acquisitions, along with the Revenue Cycle Management operating segment™s acquisitions that were previously completed in 2021, generated service revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $1,724,772, a decrease of $395,966, or (19%), as compared to $2,120,738 for the three months ended June 30, 2022._\n\n_â— Our healthcare venture is following a roll-up strategy in the medical billing industry. The venture™s acquisition targets include the approximate 6,000 medical billing companies in the United States, most of which are relatively small and closely-held private companies. Each year a portion of these company owners sell because they want to retire or exit the business for other pursuits. The Company saw the opportunity to form the venture and provide the capital to make acquisitions and pursue the medical billing company roll-up strategy at a faster pace. We expect our healthcare venture to continue its track record of providing superior medical billing services and practice management services, as well as executing a profitable roll-up strategy._\n\n_â— Overall gross profits for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were $2,737,040, an increase of $1,017,962, or 59%, as compared to $1,719,078 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The overall increase is attributable to the consistent focus on the cost of goods sold, particularly surrounding the Entertainment segment, as well as the enhanced margins within the Video Solutions segment, with its newer product offerings. Our goal is to improve our margins over the longer term based on the expected margins generated by our new recent revenue cycle management and entertainment operating segments together with our video solutions operating segment and its expected margins from our EVO-Fleet, EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, Shield disinfectants and our cloud evidence storage and management offerings, as they gain traction in the marketplace. In addition, if revenues from the video solutions segment increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from this segment through expansion and increased efficiency utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components.

Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally, stated, œWe are very pleased to report nearly $8.3 million in quarterly revenues for the second quarter of 2023, along with improved gross profits compared to the second quarter of 2022. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the EVO-HD, FirstVu Pro, and QuickVu docking stations, which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance up nearly $3.5 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the second quarter of 2022, as our contract liabilities went from approximately $6.0 million at June 30, 2022, to nearly $9.5 million at June 30, 2023. We continue to build excitement around the momentum being gained in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maximize the profitability of the four completed acquisitions. The numerous medical billing company acquisitions that we have already completed demonstrate our roll-up strategy is effective and attractive to potential targets. We look forward to seeing the growth potential of this venture come to fruition and continue throughout 2023 and beyond.\n\nRoss added: œAdditionally, we are very excited about the Agreement and Plan of Merger signed with Clover Leaf Capital Corp. to create Kustom Entertainment, Inc., a company with a focus and mission to own and produce events, festivals, and entertainment alongside its evolving primary and secondary ticketing technologies. This business combination will provide clarity to both shareholder as well as the marketplace, showing two distinct, stand-alone entities, Digital Ally and Kustom Entertainment, Further, we remain excited about the organic growth opportunities with the Kustom 440 subsidiary. Kustom 440 hosted its first festival during the second quarter, in Kansas City at Legends Field, headlining Chris Young and Gabby Barrett. We were very pleased with the results of the show and the turn-out for this event, and look forward to announcing more shows in the near future. We will continue to inform our investors as we move forward with the business combination, alongside our continuous efforts to take advantage of new business opportunities and to maximize our existing business lines to benefit the Company and its shareholders through 2023 and beyond.\n\n**2023 Operating Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $8,279,632 and $9,351,458, respectively, a decrease of $1,071,826 (11%).\n\nOverall gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $2,737,040 and $1,719,078, respectively, an increase of $1,017,962 (59%). The overall increase is attributable to the large increase in gross profit for the entertainment segment for the three months ended June 30, 2023 along with a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 67% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 82% for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $7,677,744 and $8,380,330 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $702,586 (8%).

(Nasdaq: DGLY) (the œCompany or œour)** , today announced its operating results for the first quarter 2023. An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 16, 2023 (see details below).\n\nAll share and price per share information in this press release has been adjusted to reflect the Company™s 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective on February 6, 2023.\n\nHighlights for the three months ended March 31, 2023\n\nâ— Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7,697,190 and $10,294,781, respectively, a decrease of $2,597,591 (25%). The primary reason for the overall revenue decrease is a decrease of $2,551,498 (48%) in service revenues from 2022 levels at the Entertainment Segment. Product revenues experienced a decrease during the three months ended March 31, 2023, in comparison to the same period in 2022, due to the reduction in ticket purchases within the Entertainment segment throughout the period. Service and other revenues also experienced a decline during the three months ended March 31, 2023, in comparison to the same period in 2022, due to a reduction in marketing expenses within the Entertainment segment, that resulted in a correlating decline in service revenues for the period.\n\nâ— On September 1, 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc., through which the Company completed the acquisition of Goody Tickets, LLC (œGoody Tickets) and TicketSmarter, LLC (œTicketSmarter) (collectively the œTicketSmarter Acquisition). Goody Tickets and TicketSmarter®, are ticket resale marketplaces with seats offered at over 125,000 live events, offering over 48 million tickets for sale through its TicketSmarter.com platform. This acquisition generated additional revenues totaling $4,016,236 in service and product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $6,380,775 in service and product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n\nâ— We entered the revenue cycle management business late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (œNobility Healthcare). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and a second acquisition on August 31, 2021 upon the completion of its acquisition of another private medical billing company. On January 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a private dental billing company. Additionally, on February 1, 2022, Nobility Healthcare also completed an asset purchase for a portfolio of a medical billing company. These acquisitions further enhanced the Company™s revenue cycle management operating segment, which provides revenue cycle management solutions to medium to large healthcare organizations throughout the country. These acquisitions, along with the revenue cycle management operating segment™s acquisitions that were previously completed in 2021, generated service revenues of $1,781,590 during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $1,903,957 generated for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n\nâ— Our healthcare venture is following a roll-up strategy in the medical billing industry. The venture™s acquisition targets include the approximate 6,000 medical billing companies in the United States, most of which are relatively small and closely-held private companies. Each year a portion of these company owners sell because they want to retire or exit the business for other pursuits. The Company saw the opportunity to form the venture and provide the capital to make acquisitions and pursue the medical billing company roll-up strategy at a faster pace. We expect our healthcare venture to continue its track record of providing superior medical billing services and practice management services, as well as executing a profitable roll-up strategy.\n\nâ— Overall gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,544,792 and $1,939,619, respectively, a decrease of $394,827 (20%). The overall decrease is attributable to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 81% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our goal is to improve our margins over the longer term based on the expected margins generated by our new recent revenue cycle management and entertainment operating segments together with our video solutions operating segment and its expected margins from our EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink, FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, ShieldTM disinfectants and our cloud evidence storage and management offering, provided that they gain traction in the marketplace. In addition, if revenues from the video solutions segment increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from this segment through expansion and increased efficiency utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative to more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.\n\nâ— Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7,717,598 and $8,742,957 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,025,359 (12%). The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company.\n\nâ— During 2021, the Company issued detachable warrants to purchase a total of 2,127,500 shares of Common Stock in association with the two underwritten public offerings that were completed which raised total funds of approximately $66.6 million. The underlying warrant agreement terms provide for net cash settlement outside the control of the Company in the event of tender offers under certain circumstances. As such, the Company was required to treat these warrants as derivative liabilities which are valued at their estimated fair value as of their issuance date and at each reporting date with any subsequent changes reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities. There was no change in fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023, and the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities from December 31, 2021, to March 31, 2022, totaled $148,171 which was recognized as a gain in the first quarter of 2022. The Company determined the fair value of such warrants as of December 31, 2022, and as of March 31, 2023, to be $-0- and $-0-, respectively.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nâ— On February 6, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the œReverse Stock Split) of the shares of our common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was effective as of time of filing. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, our board approved appropriate and proportional adjustments to all outstanding securities or other rights convertible or exercisable into shares of our Common Stock, including, without limitation, all preferred stock, warrants, options, and other equity compensation rights. The par value per share of our common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nâ— As previously disclosed by Digital Ally, Inc. (the œCompany) in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company had received letters from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (œNasdaq) notifying the Company of its non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the œMinimum Bid Price Rule) and granting the Company extensions to demonstrate such compliance to Nasdaq. On February 23, 2023, the Company received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Company has cured its bid price deficiency and has fully regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\n\nâ— On April 5, 2023, Digital Ally, Inc. (the œCompany) entered into and consummated the initial closing (the œFirst Closing) of the transactions contemplated by a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2023 (the œPurchase Agreement), between the Company and certain investors (the œPurchasers). At the First Closing, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers Senior Secured Convertible Notes in the aggregate original principal amount of $3,000,000 (the œNotes) and warrants (the œWarrants). The Purchase Agreement provided for a ten percent (10%) original interest discount resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $2,700,000. No interest accrues under the Notes. The Warrants are exercisable for an aggregate 1,125,000 shares comprised of 375,000 warrants at an exercise price of $5.50 per share of the Company™s common stock (the œCommon Stock), 375,000 warrants at an exercise price of $6.50 per share of Common Stock, and 375,000 warrants at an exercise price of $7.50 per share of Common Stock.\n\nManagement Comments\n\nStanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally, stated, œWe are very pleased to report nearly $7.7 million in quarterly revenues for the first quarter of 2023, along with an improved net income. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and QuickVu docking stations; which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance nearly double at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, as our contract liabilities went from about $5.0 million at March 31, 2022, to nearly $8.9 million at March 31, 2023. We continue to build excitement around the momentum being gained in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maximizing the profitability of the four completed acquisitions. The numerous acquisitions we have already completed of medical billing companies demonstrates our roll-up strategy is effective and attractive to potential targets. We look forward to seeing the growth potential of this venture come to fruition and continue throughout 2023 and beyond.\n\nRoss added: œAdditionally, we continue to be excited to maximize the profitability of the entertainment segment and have it grow organically with the kick off of our new Kustom 440 subsidiary. Kustom 440 hosted its first festival on Saturday, May 13, 2023, in Kansas City at Legends Field, headlining Chris Young and Gabby Barrett. We were very pleased with the results of the show and the turn-out for this event; we believe shareholders will benefit from the partnership between TicketSmarter and Kustom 440, along with their long-term value based on the multiples commanded by similar public companies in the market. We are continuing to right-size and adjust to the nuances of each new subsidiary, as we learn to navigate and effectively grow each of them. We will continue to inform our investors as we attempt to take advantage of new business opportunities and to maximize our existing business lines to benefit the Company and its shareholders through 2023 and beyond.\n\n2023 Operating Results\n\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7,697,190 and $10,294,781, respectively, a decrease of $2,597,591 (25%).\n\nGross profit decreased 20% to $1,544,792 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 versus $1,939,619 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The overall decrease is attributable to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 81% for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $7,717,598 and $8,742,957 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,025,359 (12%). The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company.\n\nWe reported an operating loss of $6,172,806 and $6,803,338 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $630,532 (9%).\n\nTotal other income increased to $193,227 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to total other income of $105,096 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in other income was largely attributable to the gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration promissory notes of $158,021 compared to a loss of $56,050 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This is in connection with the four acquisitions made by our revenue cycle management segment. This gain was slightly offset by a decrease in interest income to $15,477 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $71,362 in the same period of 2022, which reflects our change in cash and cash equivalent levels in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $6,105,818, or $2.22 per share, and $6,600,148, or $2.59 per share, for the years three months March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in either 2023 or 2022 as the Company has maintained a full valuation reserve on its deferred tax assets.\n\n**Investor Conference Call**\n\n**The Company will host an investor conference call at 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, to discuss its first quarter 2023 financial results, corporate and individual subsidiary outlook, and previously announced corporate separation.

A wide variety of factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) our losses in recent years, including fiscal years 2022 and 2021; (2) economic and other risks for our business from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on our law-enforcement and commercial customers, suppliers and employees and on our ability to raise capital as required; (3) our ability to increase revenues, increase our margins and return to consistent profitability in the current economic and competitive environment; (4) our operation in developing markets and uncertainty as to market acceptance of our technology and new products; (5) the availability of funding from federal, state and local governments to facilitate the budgets of law enforcement agencies, including the timing, amount and restrictions on such funding; (6) our ability to deliver our new product offerings as scheduled in 2023, and whether new products perform as planned or advertised and whether they will help increase our revenues; (7) whether we will be able to increase the sales, domestically and internationally, for our products in the future; (8) our ability to maintain or expand our share of the market for our products in the domestic and international markets in which we compete, including increasing our international revenues; (9) our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective manner; (10) competition from larger, more established companies with far greater economic and human resources; (11) our ability to attract and retain quality employees; (12) risks related to dealing with governmental entities as customers; (13) our expenditure of significant resources in anticipation of sales due to our lengthy sales cycle and the potential to receive no revenue in return; (14) characterization of our market by new products and rapid technological change; (15) that stockholders may lose all or part of their investment if we are unable to compete in our markets and return to profitability; (16) defects in our products that could impair our ability to sell our products or could result in litigation and other significant costs; (17) our dependence on key personnel; (18) our reliance on third-party distributors and sales representatives for part of our marketing capability; (19) our dependence on a few manufacturers and suppliers for components of our products and our dependence on domestic and foreign manufacturers for certain of our products; (20) our ability to protect technology through patents and to protect our proprietary technology and information, such as trade secrets, through other similar means; (21) our ability to generate more recurring cloud and service revenues; (22) risks related to our license arrangements; (23) our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter; (24) sufficient voting power by coalitions of a few of our larger stockholders, including directors and officers, to make corporate governance decisions that could have a significant effect on us and the other stockholders; (25) the sale of substantial amounts of our Common Stock that may have a depressive effect on the market price of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock; (26) the possible issuance of Common Stock subject to options and warrants that may dilute the interest of stockholders; (27) our nonpayment of dividends and lack of plans to pay dividends in the future; (28) future sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock that could depress the trading price of our common stock, lower our value and make it more difficult for us to raise capital; (29) our additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock; (30) our stock price is likely to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including a relatively limited public float; (31) whether such technology will have a significant impact on our revenues in the long-term; (32) whether we will be able to meet the standards for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market; (33) indemnification of our officers and directors; and (34) risks related to our proposed spin-off, including our ability to consummate the transactions and our ability to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits therefrom.
