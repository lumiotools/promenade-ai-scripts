          "content": "Lesaka Q1 2025 Results: Lesaka continues building operational momentum achieving Revenue and Profitability guidance\nJOHANNESBURG, November 6, 2024 – Lesaka Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: LSAK; JSE: LSK) today released results for the first\nquarter of fiscal 2025 (“Q1 2025”).\nQ1 2025 performance:\n• Revenue of $145.5 million (ZAR 2.6 billion) was at the mid-point of our revenue guidance and compares to $136.1 million\n(ZAR 2.5 billion) in Q1 2024.\n• Operating loss of $0.05 million (ZAR 0.3 million) compares to operating income of $0.2 million (ZAR 4.2 million) in Q1 2024.\nThe current quarter includes $1.7 million (ZAR 30.0 million) of one-off transaction costs relating to the acquisition of Adumo.\nExcluding the impact of these transaction costs, operating income would have been $1.7 million (ZAR 29.7 million).\n• Net loss, including $1.7 million (ZAR 30.0 million) of one-off Adumo transaction costs, improved 23% in ZAR, to a net loss of\n$4.5 million (ZAR 81.0 million) in Q1 2025.\n• GAAP loss per share improved 24% in ZAR to $0.07 (ZAR 1.26) from $0.09 (ZAR 1.66) in Q1 2024.\n• Group Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $9.4 million (ZAR 168.1 million) was at the mid-point of our guidance\nrange, improving 12% in ZAR from $8.0 million (ZAR 149.5 million) in Q1 2024.\n• Fundamental earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) of $0.04 (ZAR 0.66) improved by $0.04 (ZAR 0.74) compared to a\nfundamental loss per share of $0.00 (ZAR 0.08) in Q1 2024.\n• Consumer Division revenue increased 30% in ZAR to $21.1 million (ZAR 378.1 million) and Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased 99% in ZAR, to $4.4 million (ZAR 78.7 million).\n• Merchant Division revenue of $125.3 million (ZAR 2.3 billion) remained flat in ZAR and Segment Adjusted EBITDA contracted\nmarginally, by 1% in ZAR, to $7.9 million (ZAR 142.1 million).\n(1) Average exchange rates applicable for the quarter: ZAR 17.72 to $1 for Q1 2025, ZAR 18.71 to $1 for Q1 2024. The ZAR\nstrengthened 5.3% against the U.S. dollar during Q1 2025 when compared to Q1 2024.\nLesaka Chairman Ali Mazanderani said: “We continue to invest in building the Lesaka platform and to scale as Southern Africa’s\nleading independent fintech. We achieved the mid-point of our revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q1 2025. We have\nnow delivered on our Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for nine successive quarters and reaffirm our FY 2025 revenue guidance of\nZAR 10 billion to ZAR 11 billion and FY2025 Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance of ZAR 900 million to ZAR 1 billion. Our Net\nRevenue guidance of ZAR 5.2 billion to ZAR 5.6 billion for FY 2025 implies 35% year-on year growth at the midpoint of this range.\nOur Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for FY 2025 implies 37% growth, year-on-year, at the midpoint of the range.”\nOutlook: Second Quarter 2025 (“Q2 2025”) and reaffirming Full Fiscal Year 2025 (“FY 2025”) outlook\nWhile we report our financial results in USD, we measure our operating performance in ZAR, and as such we provide our guidance\naccordingly.\nWe have included guidance for Net Revenue, a non-GAAP measure, for the first time. This primarily eliminates the effect of changes in\nrevenue mix between agency and principal sales of airtime, which can be material. Refer below to “Use of Non-GAAP Measures” for\nadditional information.\nFor Q2 2025, the quarter ending December 31, 2024 we expect:\n• Revenue between ZAR 2.4 billion and ZAR 2.6 billion.\n• Net Revenue between ZAR 1.2 billion and ZAR 1.4 billion.\n• Group Adjusted EBITDA between ZAR 190 million and ZAR 210 million.\nGuidance For FY 2025, the year ending June 30, 2025, we expect:\n• Revenue between ZAR 10.0 billion and ZAR 11.0 billion.\n• Net Revenue between ZAR 5.2 billion and ZAR 5.6 billion.\n• Group Adjusted EBITDA between ZAR 900 million and ZAR 1 billion\nOur outlook provided:\n• Includes the impact of the acquisition of Adumo, which closed in October 2024 (in Q2 2025).\n• Excludes the impact of unannounced mergers and acquisitions that we may conclude.\nThe mid-point of the FY 2025 Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance implies a growth rate of more than 30% on a like-for-like basis\n(excluding Adumo and the allocation of interest expense charges directly related to the consumer loan book).\nManagement has provided its outlook regarding Net Revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures\nand excludes certain revenue and charges. Management has not reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items is not provided. Management is unable to provide guidance\nfor these reconciling items because they cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of the company's\ncontrol and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations\nto the corresponding GAAP financial measure are not available without unreasonable effort.\nEarnings Presentation for Q1 2025 Results\nOur earnings presentation will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website prior to our earnings call.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nLesaka will host a webcast and conference call to review results on November 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time which is 3:00 p.m.\nSouth Africa Standard Time (“SAST”). A replay of the results presentation webcast will be available on the Lesaka investor relations\nwebsite following the conclusion of the live event.\nPresentation webcast via Zoom:\nLink to access the results webcast: https://bit.ly/3BB5RHG.\nParticipants using the webcast will be able to ask questions by raising their hand and then asking the question “live.”\nConference call dial-in:\n• US Toll-Free: +1 929 205 6099 or +1 253 205 0468 or +1 253 215 8782\n• South Africa Toll-Free: +27 21 426 8190 or +27 21 426 8191 or +27 87 550 3946\nParticipants using the conference call dial-in will be unable to ask questions.\nA replay of the results presentation webcast will be available on the Lesaka investor relations website following the conclusion of the\nlive event.\nOur Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC, is available on our company website at\nwww.lesakatech.com.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nU.S. securities laws require that when we publish any non-GAAP measures, we disclose the reason for using these non-GAAP measures\nand provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The presentation of Group Adjusted EBITDA, Group\nAdjusted EBITDA margin, Net Revenue, fundamental net (loss) income, fundamental (loss) earnings per share, and headline (loss)\nearnings per share are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Attachment A for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nGroup adjusted EBITDA\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA is net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for non-operational transactions\n(including loss on disposal of equity-accounted investments), loss from equity-accounted investments, stock-based compensation charges\nand once-off items. Once-off items represents non-recurring expense items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions\nconsummated or ultimately not pursued. Group Adjusted EBITDA margin is Group Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\nNet Revenue\nWe generate revenue from the provision of transaction-processing services through our various platforms and service offerings. We use\nthese platforms to (a) sell prepaid airtime vouchers which was held as inventory, and (b) distribute VAS, including prepaid airtime\nvouchers (which we do not hold as inventory), prepaid electricity, gaming vouchers, and other products, to users of our platforms. We\nact as a principal when we sell airtime vouchers that were held as inventory and record revenue and cost of sales on a gross basis when\nsold. We act as an agent in a transaction when we provide VAS products through our various platforms and services offerings because\nwe do not control the good or service to be provided and we recognize revenue based on the amount that we are contractually entitled to\nreceive for performing the distribution service on behalf of our customers using our platform. Our revenue under GAAP can fluctuate\nmaterially due to changes in the revenue mix between these revenue categories. Net Revenue is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated\nas revenue presented under GAAP less (i) the cost of prepaid airtime vouchers sold by us, and (ii) commissions paid to third parties\nselling all other agency-based VAS products (including pinless airtime, electricity and other products) provided through our distribution\nchannels. We believe that the use of Net Revenue is meaningful to users of financial information because it seeks to eliminate the impact\nof the change in the revenue mix from the revenue categories over the periods presented.\nFundamental net earnings (loss) and fundamental earnings (loss) per share\nFundamental net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is GAAP net loss and loss per share adjusted for the amortization of\nacquisition-related intangible assets (net of deferred taxes), stock-based compensation charges, and unusual non-recurring items,\nincluding costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued.\nFundamental net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for fiscal 2024 also includes an impairment loss related to an equity-\naccounted investment, and a reversal of allowance for doubtful loan receivable.\nManagement believes that the Group Adjusted EBITDA, fundamental net earnings (loss) and fundamental earnings (loss) per share\nmetrics enhance its own evaluation, as well as an investor’s understanding, of our financial performance. Attachment A presents the\nreconciliation between GAAP net loss attributable to Lesaka and these non-GAAP measures.\nHeadline (loss) earnings per share (“H(L)EPS”)\nThe inclusion of H(L)EPS in this press release is a requirement of our listing on the JSE. H(L)EPS basic and diluted is calculated using\nnet (loss) income which has been determined based on GAAP. Accordingly, this may differ to the headline (loss) earnings per share\ncalculation of other companies listed on the JSE as these companies may report their financial results under a different financial reporting\nframework, including but not limited to, International Financial Reporting Standards.\nH(L)EPS basic and diluted is calculated as GAAP net (loss) income adjusted for the impairment losses related to our equity-accounted\ninvestments and (profit) loss on sale of property, plant and equipment. Attachment C presents the reconciliation between our net (loss)\nincome used to calculate (loss) earnings per share basic and diluted and H(L)EPS basic and diluted and the calculation of the denominator\nfor headline diluted (loss) earnings per share.\nAbout Lesaka (www.lesakatech.com)\nLesaka Technologies, (Lesaka™) is a South African Fintech company driven by a purpose to provide financial services and software to\nSouthern Africa’s underserviced consumers (B2C) and merchants (B2B), improving people’s lives and increasing financial inclusion in\nthe markets in which we operate.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries over which\nthe Company exercises control and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)\nand the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\ninclude all of the information and disclosures required for interim financial reporting. The results of operations for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The Company believes that the\ndisclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements,\naccounting policies and financial notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June\n30, 2024. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which are necessary for a fair representation of financial results for the\ninterim periods presented.\nReferences to “Lesaka” are references solely to Lesaka Technologies, Inc. References to the “Company” refer to Lesaka and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance regarding Segment Reporting (Topic\n280) to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses. In addition, the guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose\nmultiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable\nsegment, and contains other disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2024 for its year\nended June 30, 2025, and for interim periods commencing from July 1, 2025 (i.e. for the quarter ended September 30, 2025).\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance regarding Income Taxes (Topic 740) to improve income tax disclosure\nrequirements. The guidance requires entities, on an annual basis, to (1) disclose specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation\nand (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items\nis equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pre-tax income or loss by the applicable statutory\nincome tax rate). This guidance is effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2025. The Company is currently assessing the impact\nof this guidance on its financial statements and related disclosures.\n8\n2. Accounts receivable, net and other receivables and finance loans receivable, net\nAccounts receivable, net and other receivables\nThe Company’s accounts receivable, net, and other receivables as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, are presented in\nthe table below:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nAccounts receivable, trade, net $ 11,083 $ 13,262\nAccounts receivable, trade, gross 12,569 14,503\nAllowance for doubtful accounts receivable, end of period 1,486 1,241\nBeginning of period 1,241 509\nReversed to statement of operations (50) (511)\nCharged to statement of operations 307 1,305\nUtilized (87) (67)\nForeign currency adjustment 75 5\nCurrent portion of amount outstanding related to sale of interest in Carbon, net of\nallowance: September 2024: $750; June 2024: $750 - -\nCurrent portion of total held to maturity investments - -\nInvestment in 7.625% of Cedar Cellular Investment 1 (RF) (Pty) Ltd 8.625% notes - -\nOther receivables 18,742 23,405\nTotal accounts receivable, net and other receivables $ 29,825 $ 36,667\nTrade receivables include amounts due from customers which generally have a very short-term life from date of invoice or service\nprovided to settlement. The duration is less than a year in all cases and generally less than 30 days in many instances. The short-term\nnature of these exposures often results in balances at month-end that are disproportionately small compared to the total invoiced\namounts. The month-end outstanding balance are more volatile than the monthly invoice amounts because they are affected by\noperational timing issues and the fact that a balance is outstanding at month-end is not necessarily an indication of increased risk but\nrather a matter of operational timing.\nCredit risk in respect of trade receivables are generally not significant and the Company has not developed a sophisticated model\nfor these basic credit exposures. The Company determined to use a lifetime loss rate by expressing write-off experience as a percentage\nof corresponding invoice amounts (as opposed to outstanding balances). The allowance for credit losses related to these receivables\nhas been calculated by multiplying the lifetime loss rate with recent invoice/origination amounts. Management actively monitors\nperformance of these receivables over short periods of time. Different balances have different rules to identify an account in distress.\nOnce balances in distress are identified, specific allowances are immediately created. Subsequent recovery from distressed accounts\nis not significant.\nCurrent portion of amount outstanding related to sale of interest in Carbon represents an amount due related to the sale of the\nloan in Carbon Tech Limited (“Carbon”), with a face value of $3.0 million, which was sold in September 2022 for $0.75 million, net\nof an allowance for doubtful loans receivable of $0.75 million. The Company has not yet received the outstanding $0.75 million related\nto the sale of the $3.0 million loan, and continues to engage with the purchaser to recover the outstanding balance.\nInvestment in 7.625% of Cedar Cellular Investment 1 (RF) (Pty) Ltd 8.625% notes represents the investment in a note which was\ndue to mature in August 2022 and forms part of Cell C’s capital structure. The carrying value as of each of September 30, 2024, and\nJune 30, 2024, respectively was $0 (zero).\nOther receivables include prepayments, deposits, income taxes receivable and other receivables.\n9\n2. Accounts receivable, net and other receivables and finance loans receivable, net (continued)\nFinance loans receivable, net\nThe Company’s finance loans receivable, net, as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, is presented in the table below:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nMicrolending finance loans receivable, net $ 30,732 $ 28,184\nMicrolending finance loans receivable, gross 32,851 30,131\nAllowance for doubtful finance loans receivable, end of period 2,119 1,947\nBeginning of period 1,947 1,432\nReversed to statement of operations - (210)\nCharged to statement of operations 609 2,454\nUtilized (552) (1,795)\nForeign currency adjustment 115 66\nMerchant finance loans receivable, net 16,285 15,874\nMerchant finance loans receivable, gross 19,380 18,571\nAllowance for doubtful finance loans receivable, end of period 3,095 2,697\nBeginning of period 2,697 2,150\nReversed to statement of operations - (359)\nCharged to statement of operations 632 2,479\nUtilized (397) (1,672)\nForeign currency adjustment 163 99\nTotal finance loans receivable, net $ 47,017 $ 44,058\nTotal finance loans receivable, net, comprises microlending finance loans receivable related to the Company’s microlending\noperations in South Africa as well as its merchant finance loans receivable related to Connect’s lending activities in South Africa.\nCertain merchant finance loans receivable with an aggregate balance of $15.6 million as of September 30, 2024 have been pledged as\nsecurity for the Company’s revolving credit facility (refer to Note 8).\nAllowance for credit losses\nMicrolending finance loans receivable\nMicrolending finance loans receivable is related to the Company’s microlending operations in South Africa whereby it provides\nunsecured short-term loans to qualifying customers. Loans to customers have a tenor of up to six months, with the majority of loans\noriginated having a tenor of six months. The Company analyses this lending book as a single portfolio because the loans within the\nportfolio have similar characteristics and management uses similar processes to monitor and assess the credit risk of the lending book.\nRefer to Note 4 related to the Company risk management process related to these receivables.\nThe Company has operated this lending book for more than five years and uses historical default experience over the lifetime of\nloans in order to calculate a lifetime loss rate for the lending book. The allowance for credit losses related to these microlending finance\nloans receivables is calculated by multiplying the lifetime loss rate with the month end outstanding lending book. The lifetime loss\nrate as of each of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, was 6.50%. The performing component (that is, outstanding loan payments\nnot in arrears) of the book exceeds more than 98%, of the outstanding lending book as of each of June 30, 2024 and September 30,\n2024.\nMerchant finance loans receivable\nMerchant finance loans receivable is related to the Company’s Merchant lending activities in South Africa whereby it provides\nunsecured short-term loans to qualifying customers. Loans to customers have a tenor of up to twelve months, with the majority of\nloans originated having a tenor of approximately eight months. The Company analyses this lending book as a single portfolio because\nthe loans within the portfolio have similar characteristics and management uses similar processes to monitor and assess the credit risk\nof the lending book. Refer to Note 4 related to the Company risk management process related to these receivables.\n10\n2. Accounts receivable, net and other receivables and finance loans receivable, net (continued)\nFinance loans receivable, net (continued)\nAllowance for credit losses (continued)\nMerchant finance loans receivable (continued)\nThe Company has recently (in the past three years) commenced lending to merchant customers and uses historical default\nexperience over the lifetime of loans generated thus far in order to calculate a lifetime loss rate for the lending book. The allowance\nfor credit losses related to these merchant finance loans receivables is calculated by adding together actual receivables in default plus\nmultiplying the lifetime loss rate with the month-end outstanding lending book. The lifetime loss rate as of each of June 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2024, was approximately 1.18%. The performing component (that is, outstanding loan payments not in arrears), under-\nperforming component (that is, outstanding loan payments that are in arrears) and non-performing component (that is, outstanding\nloans for which payments appeared to have ceased) of the book represents approximately 84%, 15% and 1%, respectively, of the\noutstanding lending book as of June 30, 2024. The performing component, under-performing component and non-performing\ncomponent of the book represents approximately 85%, 15% and 0%, respectively, of the outstanding lending book as of September\n30, 2024.\n3. Inventory\nThe Company’s inventory comprised the following categories as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nRaw materials $ 2,784 $ 2,791\nWork-in-progress 744 71\nFinished goods 16,666 15,364\n$ 20,194 $ 18,226\nFinished goods as of June 30, 2024, includes $1.8 million of Cell C airtime inventory that was previously classified as finished\ngoods subject to sale restrictions. The Company sold all of this inventory during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n4. Fair value of financial instruments\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial instruments are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the transaction. Initial measurements are at cost,\nwhich includes transaction costs.\nRisk management\nThe Company manages its exposure to currency exchange, translation, interest rate, credit, microlending credit and equity price\nand liquidity risks as discussed below.\nCurrency exchange risk\nThe Company is subject to currency exchange risk because it purchases components for its safe assets, that the Company\nassembles, and inventories that it is required to settle in other currencies, primarily the euro, renminbi, and U.S. dollar. The Company\nhas used forward contracts in order to limit its exposure in these transactions to fluctuations in exchange rates between the South\nAfrican rand (“ZAR”), on the one hand, and the U.S. dollar and the euro, on the other hand.\nTranslation risk\nTranslation risk relates to the risk that the Company’s results of operations will vary significantly as the U.S. dollar is its reporting\ncurrency, but it earns a significant amount of its revenues and incurs a significant amount of its expenses in ZAR. The U.S. dollar to\nthe ZAR exchange rate has fluctuated significantly over the past three years. As exchange rates are outside the Company’s control,\nthere can be no assurance that future fluctuations will not adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\n11\n4. Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\nRisk management (continued)\nInterest rate risk\nAs a result of its normal borrowing activities, the Company’s operating results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which\nit manages primarily through regular financing activities. Interest rates in South Africa have remained unchanged in recent quarters\nand in September 2024, the South African Reserve Bank announced a 25-basis point reduction in the South African repurchase rate,\nwith further reductions expected in the short-term. Therefore, ignoring the impact of changes to the margin on its borrowings (refer to\nNote 8), the Company expects its cost of borrowing to decline moderately in the foreseeable future, however, the Company would\nexpect a higher cost of borrowing if interest rates were to increase in the future. The Company periodically evaluates the cost and\neffectiveness of interest rate hedging strategies to manage this risk. The Company generally maintains surplus cash in cash equivalents\nand held to maturity investments and has occasionally invested in marketable securities.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties. The\nCompany maintains credit risk policies in respect of its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an\nevaluation of a potential counterparty’s financial condition, credit rating, and other credit criteria and risk mitigation tools as the\nCompany’s management deems appropriate. With respect to credit risk on financial instruments, the Company maintains a policy of\nentering into such transactions only with South African and European financial institutions that have a credit rating of “B” (or its\nequivalent) or better, as determined by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings.\nConsumer microlending credit risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in its Consumer microlending activities, which provides unsecured short-term loans to\nqualifying customers. Credit bureau checks as well as an affordability test are conducted as part of the origination process, both of\nwhich are in line with local regulations. The Company considers this policy to be appropriate because the affordability test it performs\ntakes into account a variety of factors such as other debts and total expenditures on normal household and lifestyle expenses. Additional\nallowances may be required should the ability of its customers to make payments when due deteriorate in the future. Judgment is\nrequired to assess the ultimate recoverability of these finance loan receivables, including ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness\nof each customer.\nMerchant lending\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable related to its Merchant services segment with respect\nto short-term loans to qualifying merchant customers. The Company’s risk management procedures include adhering to its proprietary\nlending criteria which uses an online-system loan application process, obtaining necessary customer transaction-history data and credit\nbureau checks. The Company considers these procedures to be appropriate because it takes into account a variety of factors such as\nthe customer’s credit capacity and customer-specific risk factors when originating a loan.\nEquity price and liquidity risk\nEquity price risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of the volatility in the exchange-traded price\nof equity securities that it holds. The market price of these securities may fluctuate for a variety of reasons and, consequently, the\namount that the Company may obtain in a subsequent sale of these securities may significantly differ from the reported market value.\nEquity liquidity risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of the lack of liquidity on the exchange\non which those securities are listed. The Company may not be able to sell some or all of these securities at one time, or over an\nextended period of time without influencing the exchange-traded price, or at all.\nFinancial instruments\nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure its significant financial assets and\nliabilities at fair value.\nIn general, and where applicable, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine\nfair value. This pricing methodology would apply to Level 1 investments. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities are not available to determine fair value, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs\nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. These investments would be included in Level 2\ninvestments. In circumstances in which inputs are generally unobservable, values typically reflect management’s estimates of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-\nbased techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. Investments valued using\nsuch techniques are included in Level 3 investments.\n12\n4. Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\nFinancial instruments (continued)\nAsset measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs – investment in Cell C\nThe Company’s Level 3 asset represents an investment of 75,000,000 class “A” shares in Cell C, a significant mobile telecoms\nprovider in South Africa. The Company used a discounted cash flow model developed by the Company to determine the fair value of\nits investment in Cell C as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and valued Cell C at $0.0 (zero) and $0.0 (zero) as\nof September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company incorporates the payments under Cell C’s lease liabilities into\nthe cash flow forecasts and assumes that Cell C’s deferred tax assets would be utilized over the forecast period. The Company has\nassumed a marketability discount of 20% and a minority discount from of 24%. The Company utilized the latest business plan provided\nby Cell C management for the period ending December 31, 2027, for the September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, valuations.\nAdjustments have been made to the WACC rate to reflect the Company’s assessment of risk to Cell C achieving its business plan.\nThe following key valuation inputs were used as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\"): Between 21% and 23% over the period of the forecast\nLong term growth rate: 4.5% (4.5% as of June 30, 2024)\nMarketability discount: 20% (20% as of June 30, 2024)\nMinority discount: 24% (24% as of June 30, 2024)\nNet adjusted external debt - September 30, 2024:(1) ZAR 7.4 billion ($0.4 billion), no lease liabilities included\nNet adjusted external debt - June 30, 2024:(2) ZAR 8 billion ($0.4 billion), no lease liabilities included\n(1) translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents the impact on the carrying value of the Company’s Cell C investment of a 1.0% decrease and 1.0%\nincrease in the WACC rate and the EBITDA margins respectively used in the Cell C valuation on September 30, 2024, all amounts\ntranslated at exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024:\nSensitivity for fair value of Cell C investment 1.0% increase 1.0% decrease\nWACC rate $ - $ 519\nEBITDA margin $ 146 $ -\nThe fair value of the Cell C shares as of September 30, 2024, represented 0% of the Company’s total assets, including these\nshares. The Company expects to hold these shares for an extended period of time and that there will be short-term equity price volatility\nwith respect to these shares particularly given that Cell C remains in a turnaround process.\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024,\naccording to the fair value hierarchy:\nQuoted Price in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets\nInvestment in Cell C $ - $ - $ - $ -\nRelated to insurance\nCash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash (included\nin other long-term assets) 235 - - 235\nFixed maturity\ninvestments (included in\ncash and cash equivalents) 5,523 - - 5,523\nTotal assets at fair value $ 5,758 $ - $ - $ 5,758\n13\n4.

The\nfair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include\nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of\nthe asset exceeds its fair value and the excess is determined to be other-than-temporary. Refer to Note 5 for impairment charges\nrecorded during the reporting periods presented herein. The Company has no liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.\n14\n5.

Closed transaction closed in December 2023. The\nCompany considered the August 10, 2023, agreement to be an impairment indicator. The Company is required to include any foreign\ncurrency translation reserve and other equity account amounts in its impairment assessment if it considers exiting an equity method\ninvestment. The Company performed an impairment assessment of its holding in Finbond, including the foreign currency translation\nreserve and other equity account amounts, as of September 30, 2023. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.2 million during\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023, which represented the difference between the determined fair value of the Company’s interest\nin Finbond and the Company’s carrying value, including the foreign currency translation reserve (before the impairment). The\nCompany used the price of ZAR 0.2911 referenced in the August 2023 agreement referred to above to calculate the determined fair\nvalue for Finbond.\nCarbon\nIn September 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Net1 Applied Technologies Netherlands B.V.

During the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $0.3 million and $0.05 million,\nrespectively, related to the deferred tax benefit recognized because it does not believe that the stock-based compensation deduction\nwould be utilized as it does not anticipate generating sufficient taxable income in the United States.

(Loss) Earnings per share\nThe Company has issued redeemable common stock which is redeemable at an amount other than fair value. Redemption of a\nclass of common stock at other than fair value increases or decreases the carrying amount of the redeemable common stock and is\nreflected in basic earnings per share using the two-class method. There were no redemptions of common stock, or adjustments to the\ncarrying value of the redeemable common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Accordingly, the two-\nclass method presented below does not include the impact of any redemption. The Company’s redeemable common stock is described\nin Note 14 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024.\nBasic (loss) earnings per share includes shares of restricted stock that meet the definition of a participating security because these\nshares are eligible to receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stock. Basic (loss) earnings per share\nhas been calculated using the two-class method and basic (loss) earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, reflects only undistributed earnings. The computation below of basic (loss) earnings per share excludes the net loss attributable\nto shares of unvested restricted stock (participating non-vested restricted stock) from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact\nof these unvested shares of restricted stock from the denominator.\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share has been calculated to give effect to the number of shares of additional common stock that\nwould have been outstanding if the potential dilutive instruments had been issued in each period. Stock options are included in the\ncalculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method and are not considered to be participating securities,\nas the stock options do not contain non-forfeitable dividend rights. The Company has excluded employee stock options to purchase\n65,173 and 41,809 shares of common stock from the calculation of diluted loss per share during the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, because the effect would be antidilutive.\nThe calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of a portion of the restricted stock granted to\nemployees as these shares of restricted stock are considered contingently returnable shares for the purposes of the diluted (loss)\nearnings per share calculation and the vesting conditions in respect of a portion of the restricted stock had been satisfied.\n25\n13. (Loss) Earnings per share (continued)\nThe vesting conditions for all awards made are discussed in Note 17 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents net loss attributable to Lesaka and the share data used in the basic and diluted loss per share\ncomputations using the two-class method:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands except\npercent and\nper share data)\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to Lesaka $ (4,542) $ (5,651)\nUndistributed (loss) earnings $ (4,542) $ (5,651)\nPercent allocated to common shareholders (Calculation 1) 97 96\nNumerator for (loss) earnings per share: basic and diluted (4,399) (5,402)\nContinuing (4,399) (5,402)\nDenominator\nDenominator for basic (loss) earnings per share:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding 62,265 60,990\nDenominator for diluted (loss) earnings per share: adjusted weighted average\ncommon shares outstanding and assuming conversion 62,265 60,990\n(Loss) Earnings per share:\nBasic $ (0.07) $ (0.09)\nDiluted $ (0.07) $ (0.09)\n(Calculation 1)\nBasic weighted-average common shares outstanding (A) 62,265 60,990\nBasic weighted-average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares\nexpected to vest (B) 64,293 63,805\nPercent allocated to common shareholders (A) / (B) 97 96\nOptions to purchase 4,224,210 shares of the Company’s common stock at prices ranging from $4.87 to $14.00 per share were\noutstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings\nper share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company’s common stock. Options to\npurchase 262,506 shares of the Company’s common stock at prices ranging from $4.87 to $11.23 per share were outstanding during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share\nbecause the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company’s common stock.

Operating segments\nOperating segments\nThe Company discloses segment information as reflected in the management information systems reports that its chief operating\ndecision maker uses in making decisions and to report certain entity-wide disclosures about products and services, and the countries in\nwhich the entity holds material assets or reports material revenues. A description of the Company’s operating segments is contained in\nNote 21 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024.\nThe Company analyzes its business and operations in terms of two inter-related but independent operating segments:\n(1) Consumer Division (“Consumer”) and (2) Merchant Division (“Merchant”).\nThe reconciliation of the reportable segment’s revenue to revenue from external customers for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:\nRevenue\nFrom\nReportable Inter- external\nSegment segment customers\nMerchant $ 125,261 $ 787 $ 124,474\nConsumer 21,072 - 21,072\nTotal for the three months ended September 30, 2024 $ 146,333 $ 787 $ 145,546\nMerchant $ 121,361 $ 852 $ 120,509\nConsumer 15,580 - 15,580\nTotal for the three months ended September 30, 2023 $ 136,941 $ 852 $ 136,089\n29\n17. Operating segments (continued)\nOperating segments (continued)\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA”), adjusted for items mentioned in the next sentence (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”), the Company’s reportable segments’\nmeasure of profit or loss. The Company intends to obtain a separate lending facility to fund a portion of its Consumer lending during\nthe twelve months ended June 30, 2025. The Company expected to have this facility in place on July 1, 2024, however, the Company\nhas been unable to finalize terms as the separate lending facility will form part of a broader financing package. Therefore, the Company\nhas included an intercompany interest expense in its Consumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30,\n2024. The Company does not allocate once-off items, stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization, impairment\nof goodwill or other intangible assets, other items (including gains or losses on disposal of investments, fair value adjustments to equity\nsecurities), interest income, certain interest expense, income tax expense or loss from equity-accounted investments to its reportable\nsegments. Group costs generally include: employee related costs in relation to employees specifically hired for group roles and related\ndirectly to managing the US-listed entity; expenditures related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; non-employee\ndirectors’ fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit fees; and directors and officer’s insurance premiums. Once-off items\nrepresents non-recurring expense items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued.\nUnrealized loss FV for currency adjustments represents foreign currency mark-to-market adjustments on certain intercompany\naccounts. Interest adjustment represents the intercompany interest expense included in the Consumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The\nStock-based compensation adjustments reflect stock-based compensation expense and are excluded from the calculation of Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA and are therefore reported as reconciling items to reconcile the reportable segments’ Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nto the Company’s loss before income tax expense. Effective from fiscal 2025, all lease charges are allocated to the Company’s operating\nsegments, whereas in fiscal 2024 the Company presented certain lease charges on a separate line outside of its operating segments.\nPrior period information has been re-presented to include the lease charges which were previously reported on a separate line in the\nCompany’s Consumer and Merchant operating segments.\nThe reconciliation of the reportable segments’ measures of profit or loss to loss before income tax expense for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nReportable segments measure of profit or loss $ 12,312 $ 9,845\nOperating loss: Group costs (2,949) (1,822)\nOnce-off costs (1,805) (78)\nUnrealized Loss FV for currency adjustments 219 (102)\nInterest adjustment 831 -\nStock-based compensation charge adjustments (2,377) (1,759)\nDepreciation and amortization (6,276) (5,856)\nReversal of allowance of EMI doubtful debt - 250\nInterest income 586 449\nInterest expense (5,032) (4,909)\nLoss before income tax expense $ (4,491) $ (3,982)\n30\n17. Operating segments (continued)\nOperating segments (continued)\nThe following tables summarize segment information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenues\nMerchant $ 125,261 $ 121,361\nConsumer 21,072 15,580\nTotal reportable segment revenue 146,333 136,941\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nMerchant (1) 7,916 7,725\nConsumer (1) 4,396 2,120\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA 12,312 9,845\nDepreciation and amortization\nMerchant 2,327 2,078\nConsumer 202 169\nSubtotal: Operating segments 2,529 2,247\nGroup costs 3,747 3,609\nTotal 6,276 5,856\nExpenditures for long-lived assets\nMerchant 3,908 2,763\nConsumer 57 46\nSubtotal: Operating segments 3,965 2,809\nGroup costs - -\nTotal $ 3,965 $ 2,809\n(1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, includes retrenchments costs for Consumer of\n$0.06 million (ZAR 1.1 million) and for Merchant, costs of $0.01 million (ZAR 0.2 million). Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, includes retrenchments costs for Merchant of $0.2 million (ZAR 4.6 million) and for Consumer,\ncosts of $0.1 million (ZAR 1.5 million).\nThe segment information as reviewed by the chief operating decision maker does not include a measure of segment assets per\nsegment as all of the significant assets are used in the operations of all, rather than any one, of the segments. The Company does not\nhave dedicated assets assigned to a particular operating segment. Accordingly, it is not meaningful to attempt an arbitrary allocation\nand segment asset allocation is therefore not presented.\n31\n18. Income tax\nIncome tax in interim periods\nFor the purposes of interim financial reporting, the Company determines the appropriate income tax provision by first applying\nthe effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year to ordinary income. This amount is then adjusted for the tax\neffect of significant unusual items, for instance, changes in tax law, valuation allowances and non-deductible transaction-related\nexpenses that are reported separately, and have an impact on the tax charge. The cumulative effect of any change in the enacted tax\nrate, if and when applicable, on the opening balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is also included in the tax charge as a discrete\nevent in the interim period in which the enactment date occurs.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s effective tax rate was impacted by the tax expense recorded by\nthe Company’s profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses (including transaction-related expenditures), the on-\ngoing losses incurred by certain of the Company’s South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related\nto the deferred tax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was impacted by the tax expense recorded by\nthe Company’s profitable South African operations, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of the\nCompany’s South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized\nregarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.\nUncertain tax positions\nAs of three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company\nfiles income tax returns mainly in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company’s South African subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax examination by the South African Revenue Service for\nperiods before June 30, 2020. The Company is subject to income tax in other jurisdictions outside South Africa, none of which are\nindividually material to its financial position, statement of cash flows, or results of operations.\n19. Commitments and contingencies\nGuarantees\nThe South African Revenue Service and certain of the Company’s customers, suppliers and other business partners have asked\nthe Company to provide them with guarantees, including standby letters of credit, issued by South African banks. The Company is\nrequired to procure these guarantees for these third parties to operate its business.\nRMB has issued guarantees to these third parties amounting to ZAR 33.1 million ($1.9 million, translated at exchange rates\napplicable as of September 30, 2024) thereby utilizing part of the Company’s short-term facilities. The Company pays commission of\nbetween 3.42% per annum to 3.44% per annum of the face value of these guarantees and does not recover any of the commission from\nthird parties.\nNedbank has issued guarantees to these third parties amounting to ZAR 2.1 million ($0.1 million, translated at exchange rates\napplicable as of September 30, 2024) thereby utilizing part of the Company’s short-term facilities. The Company pays commission of\nbetween 0.47% per annum to 1.84% per annum of the face value of these guarantees and does not recover any of the commission from\nthird parties.\nThe Company has not recognized any obligation related to these guarantees in its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30,\n2024. The maximum potential amount that the Company could pay under these guarantees is ZAR 35.2 million ($1.9 million, translated\nat exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024). As discussed in Note 8, the Company has ceded and pledged certain bank\naccounts to Nedbank as security for the guarantees issued by them with an aggregate value of ZAR 2.1 million ($0.1 million, translated\nat exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024). The guarantees have reduced the amount available under its indirect and\nderivative facilities in the Company’s short-term credit facilities described in Note 8.\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to a variety of insignificant claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Management currently believes that the resolution of these other matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n32\n20. Acquisitions\n2025 Acquisitions\nOctober 2024 acquisition of Adumo\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lesaka SA, and\nCrossfin Apis Transactional Solutions (Pty) Ltd and Adumo ESS (Pty) Ltd (“the Sellers”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and\nsubject to its terms and conditions, Lesaka, through its subsidiary, Lesaka SA, agreed to acquire, and the Sellers agreed to sell, all of\nthe outstanding equity interests and certain claims in the Adumo (RF) Proprietary Limited (“Adumo”).

The Company’s ecosystem now\nserves approximately 1.7 million active consumers, 120,200 merchants, and processes over ZAR 270 billion in throughput (cash, card\nand VAS) per year. The acquisition of Adumo enhances the Company’s strength in both the consumer and merchant markets in which\nit operates.\nThe purchase consideration was settled through the combination of an issuance of 17,279,803 shares of the Company’s common\nstock (“Consideration Shares”) and a ZAR 232.2 million ($13.4 million, translated at the prevailing rate of $1: ZAR 17.3354 as of\nOctober 1, 2024) payment in cash. The Company’s closing price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on October 1, 2024, was ZAR\n83.05 ($4.79 using the October 1, 2024, $1: ZAR exchange rate). The total purchase consideration was ZAR 1.67 billion ($96.2\nmillion).\nThe closing of the transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) approval from the competition\nauthorities of South Africa and Namibia; (ii) exchange control approval from the financial surveillance department of the South African\nReserve Bank; (iii) approval from all necessary regulatory bodies and from shareholders to issue the Consideration Shares to the\nSellers; (iv) obtaining certain third-party consents; (v) the Company obtained confirmation from RMB that it has sufficient funds to\nsettle the cash portion of the purchase consideration; (vi) approval of Adumo shareholders (including preference shareholders) with\nrespect to entering into and implementation of the Purchase Agreement, and all other agreements and transactions contemplated in the\nPurchase Agreement; (vii) obtained the consent of Adumo’s lender regarding Adumo entering into and implementing the Purchase\nAgreement, and all other agreements and transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement; (viii) the release of certain Seller’s\nshares held as security by such bank; (ix) consent of the lender of one of Adumo’s shareholders regarding Adumo entering into the\ntransaction; (x) the Company signing a written addendum to the Policy Agreement with International Finance Corporation that\nprovides for the inclusion of the Consideration Shares attributable to certain Seller shareholders in the definition of “Put Shares” under\nthe Policy Agreement, and related change; and (xi) a Seller (or their nominee), which ultimately was Crossfin, concluding share\npurchase agreements to dispose of an amount of Consideration Shares (which ultimately was determined as 3,587,332 Consideration\nShares).\nThe Company has agreed to file a resale registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) covering the resale of the Consideration Shares by the Sellers. The Company has undertaken to use its commercially\nreasonable efforts to have the resale registration statement declared effective by the SEC following its filing.\nThe Company incurred transaction-related expenditures of $1.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrelated to acquisition of Adumo. The Company’s accruals presented in Note 9 of as September 30, 2024, includes an accrual of\ntransaction related expenditures of $2.2 million and the Company does not expect to incur any further significant transaction costs\nover the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year.\n33\n20. Acquisitions (continued)\n2025 Acquisitions (continued)\nOctober 2024 acquisition of Adumo (continued)\nOn October 1, 2024, Lesaka SA and Crossfin entered into a share purchase agreement under which Lesaka SA purchased\n2,601,410 of the 3,587,332 Consideration Shares for ZAR 207.2 million ($12.0 million). The transaction was settled in early October\n2024, and the shares of Company’s common stock repurchased will be included in the Company’s treasury shares.\nThe Company has commenced the purchase price allocation related to this transaction. However, the process had not been\ncompleted as of the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on November 6, 2024. The Company expects to include its\npreliminary allocation of the purchase consideration related to this acquisition in its unaudited financial statements to be included in\nits Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2024.\n34\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024,\nand the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Form 10-Q.\nU.S. securities laws require that when we publish any non-GAAP measures, we disclose the reason for using these non-GAAP\nmeasures and provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We discuss why we consider it useful to\npresent these non-GAAP measures and the material risks and limitations of these measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-\nGAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure below at “—Results of Operations—Use of Non-GAAP\nMeasures” below.\nForward-looking statements\nSome of the statements in this Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our\nfuture financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s\nactual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity,\nperformance or achievements expressed, implied or inferred by these forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other\nthings, those listed under Item 1A.—“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. In some\ncases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “expects”,\n“plans”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of such terms and other\ncomparable terminology.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know whether\nwe can achieve positive future results, levels of activity, performance, or goals. Actual events or results may differ materially. We\nundertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform those statements\nto reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law.\nYou should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and the documents we have filed as exhibits hereto\nand thereto and which we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) completely and with the\nunderstanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what\nwe expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nRecent Developments\nOur mission at Lesaka is driven by a purpose to provide financial services and software to Southern Africa’s underserviced\nconsumers (B2C) and merchants (B2B), improving people’s lives and increasing financial inclusion in the markets in which we\noperate. We offer a wide range of integrated payment solutions including transactional accounts (banking), lending, insurance, payouts,\ncash management solutions, card acceptance, supplier payments, software services and bill payments. By providing a full-service\nfintech platform in our connected ecosystem, we facilitate the digitization of commerce in our markets.\nWe experienced continued improvement in our financial and operational performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Revenue\nof $145.5 million (ZAR 2.6 billion) was at the mid-point of our revenue guidance and compares to $136.1 million (ZAR 2.5 billion)\nin 2024.\nOperating loss of $0.05 million (ZAR 0.3 million) includes the impact of $1.7 million (ZAR 30.0 million) one-off Adumo\ntransaction costs. We reported a net loss attributable to the company of $4.5 million (ZAR 81.0 million) during the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025 compared with a net loss of $5.7 million (ZAR 105.6 million) during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA of $9.4 million (ZAR 168.1 million) was at the mid-point of our guidance range, representing the ninth\nsuccessive quarter of Lesaka achieving or outperforming its Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance. Group Adjusted EBITDA is a non-\nGAAP measure, refer to reconciliation below at “—Results of Operations—Use of Non-GAAP Measures”.\nWe continue to broaden our product proposition and solve for both consumer and merchant pain-points.\nMerchant Division\nThe year-on-year performance in our Merchant Division (“Merchant”) is supported by the robust secular trends underpinning\nfinancial inclusion, cash management and digitalization to empower micro-merchants, merchants and enterprise clients to transact\nefficiently and fulfill their potential.\nPerformance in Merchant has been driven by:\n35\nOur VAS and supplier payments business continues to see adoption by micro-merchants.\n2025 2 year\nQ1 Q1 Q1\nFiscal quarter ended September 30, vs. CAGR\n2025 2024 2023\n2024 %\nApproximate number of devices in deployment1 89,040 77,000 57,000 16% 25%\nTotal Throughput for the quarter (ZAR billions) 9.9 7.2 5.9 38% 30%\nThroughput for the quarter international money transfers\n1.3 0.3 1.6 333% (10%)\n(“IMT”) (ZAR billions)\nThroughput for the quarter supplier payments (ZAR billions) 3.2 2 0.6 60% 131%\nTotal throughput for the quarter excluding IMT and supplier\n5.4 4.9 3.7 10% 21%\npayments (ZAR billions)\n1. 2025 includes approximately 5,430 devices attributable to the acquisition of Touchsides, effective May 1, 2024, which are\nnot enabled for VAS and supplier payments on the Kazang platform.\n We had approximately 89,040 devices deployed at September 30, 2024, representing a 16% year-on-year growth\ncompared to approximately 77,000 devices as of September 30, 2023, and a 2-year CAGR of 25% compared to\nSeptember 30, 2022. This includes approximately 5,430 devices in Touchsides sites that are not yet enabled for VAS\nand supplier payments on the Kazang platform.\n Core to our device placement strategy is the decision to focus on quality business and optimizing our existing fleet,\nwhich is reflected in a healthy throughput growth and margin per device.\n VAS and supplier payments throughput increased 38% to R9.9 billion. We have separately disclosed supplier payments\nfrom traditional VAS as it is becoming a material contributor to our throughput and attracts a lower gross profit margin.\nSupplier payments is an important part of the micro-merchant ecosystem we are developing as part of our strategy to\nprovide a holistic offering to micro-merchants in informal markets.\n VAS throughput, excluding IMT and supplier payments increased 10% to R5.4 billion. Our supplier payments\nthroughput increased by 60% year on year to R3.2 billion as we added further suppliers onto our platform. The\ninternational money transfer throughput recovered significantly and is approaching the levels from quarter one fiscal\n2022.\nOur card acceptance solutions to micro-merchants is through Kazang Pay and to merchants through Card Connect.\n2 year\nQ1 Q1 Q1 2025 vs.\nFiscal quarter ended September 30, CAGR\n2025 2024 2023 2024\n%\nApproximate number of devices in deployment1 53,450 46,600 27,700 15% 39%\nTotal Throughput for the quarter (ZAR billions) 4.3 3.6 2.3 18% 36%\n The trend towards digital payments continued year on year with a 15% increase in devices and a 18% increase in\nthroughput to R4.2 billion for the quarter\nOur lending solutions offered to merchants through Capital Connect in the merchant market.\n2025 2 year\nQ1 Q1 Q1\nFiscal quarter ended September 30, vs. CAGR\n2025 2024 2023\n2024 %\nTotal credit disbursed (ZAR millions) 166 196 226 (15%) (14%)\nTotal net loan book size at period end\n273 285 274 (4%) 0%\n(ZAR millions)\nCapital Connect credit disbursed\n166 173 190 (4%) (7%)\n(ZAR millions)\nCapital Connect loan book size at period end (ZAR\n273 280 254 (3%) 4%\nmillions)\nKazang Pay Advance credit disbursed\n0 23 36 n/m n/m\n(ZAR millions)\nKazang Pay Advance loan book size at period end (ZAR\n0 5 20 n/m n/m\nmillions)\n36\n Capital Connect disbursed ZAR 166 million during Q1 2025, compared to ZAR 173 million in the comparable period\nlast year, representing a 4% decrease, reflective of the deterioration in financial strength of our merchants compared to\na year ago. We have maintained our strict credit criteria during the high interest rate and inflationary cycle resulting in\nless merchants qualifying for new or renewals of credit lines.\n With a more positive political environment, the suspension of load-shedding and hopefully the start of an interest rate\ndown cycle, we are more optimistic this business can resume a growth trend reflective in the 8% increase in Capital\nConnect disbursements this quarter compared to ZAR 154 million a quarter ago (quarter four fiscal 2024.)\n Capital Connect’s lending proposition is an important component in enabling the merchants we serve to compete and\ngrow. Since inception, Capital Connect has distributed more than ZAR 3 billion of funding to merchants and can provide\nfunding of up to ZAR 5 million in under 24 hours. Quick access to affordable and flexible opportunity capital is vital in\nevery stage of a merchant’s lifecycle, enabling them to never miss an opportunity.\n Kazang Pay Advance, our lending offering in the micro-merchant sector, was suspended in early fiscal 2024 following\nthe decision to discontinue the current product, especially in the high interest rate environment. We continued to explore\nother options with respect to this offering with it now in live pilot phase. We are monitoring payment behavior on a\nsmaller loan book and applying stricter lending criteria before the official relaunch later in fiscal 2025.\nOur cash management and digitalization solutions effectively “puts the bank” in approximately 4,480 merchants’ stores.\n2025 vs. 2 year\nFiscal quarter ended September 30, Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Q1 2023\n2024 CAGR %\nApproximate number of devices in deployment1 4,480 4,400 4,200 2% 3%\nCash settlements (throughput) for the quarter (ZAR\n28.7 27.6 27.5 4% 2%\nbillions)\no Our cash business remains a vital product in our merchant offering and is a key differentiator for us in the\ndigitalization of cash. We provide robust cash vaults in the SME sector (Cash Connect) and are building a presence\nin the micro-merchant sector (Kazang Vaults), which enables our merchant customer base to significantly mitigate\ntheir operational risks pertaining to cash management and security.\no Whilst there is trend towards digital payments, cash remains as the most significant portion of retail transactions\nespecially in informal markets. This business is primarily exposed to the mid-market SMEs, a sector which has\nexperienced challenges such as power outages, high price inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending, over the\npast 24 months. This impacted the merchants we serve in this sector and resulted in increased bankruptcies and vault\nupliftments which affected the net growth in the vault estate.\nConsumer Division\nIn our Consumer Division we offer transactional accounts (banking), insurance, lending and payments solutions designed to\nimprove the lives of historically underserviced consumers and continue to deliver against our strategic focus areas underpinning our\ngrowth strategy. Progress made on these levers: (i) growing active EasyPay Everywhere (“EPE”) account numbers; (ii) increasing\naverage revenue per user (“ARPU”) through cross-selling; (iii) cost optimization; and (iv) enhancing our product and service offering,\nresulted in revenue and profitability growth in the Consumer Division in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n37\nConsumer\n2025 vs.\nFiscal quarter ended September 30, Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Q1 2023\n2024\nTransactional accounts (banking) - EasyPay Everywhere (\"EPE\")\nTotal active EPE transactional account base at quarter\n1.5 1.3 1.2 14%\nend (millions)\nTotal active EPE transactional account base at quarter\n1.3 1.1 1.1 18%\nend - Permanent grant recipients (millions)\nApproximate Gross EPE account activations for the\n62,000 76,000 45,000 (19%)\nquarter -Permanent grant recipients (number)\nApproximate Net EPE account activations for the\n26,000 42,000 3,000 (39%)\nquarter - Permanent grant recipients (number)\nLending - EasyPay Loans\nApproximate number of loans originated during the\n286,000 222,000 198,000 28%\nquarter (number)\nGross advances in the quarter (ZAR millions) 451 353 289 28%\nLoan book size, before allowances, at quarter end1\n564 423 351 34%\n(ZAR millions)\nInsurance - EasyPay Insurance\nApproximate number of insurance policies written in\n49,000 38,000 25,000 29%\nthe quarter (number)\nTotal active insurance policies on book at quarter end\n466,000 359,000 268,000 30%\n(number)\nAverage revenue per customer per month, as of\nSeptember 30, (permanent grant beneficiaries) 91 83 71 10%\n(ZAR)\n1. Gross loan book, before provisions.\n Driving customer acquisition\no Gross EPE account activations, continue to grow at the new levels for the permanent base, post our marketing and\ndistribution network enhancements in fiscal 2024. We achieved approximately 62,000 gross account activations in\nthe quarter which was pleasing in a traditionally quiet quarter for us. This compares to a higher than usual activation\nrate in quarter one fiscal 2024 due to significant migration away from the South African Post Office in that quarter\ndriven by concerns around its going concern status and its failure to timeously distribute grants timeously. Net\nactivations of 26,000 in the quarter was negatively impacted by the closure of the SASSA (South African Social\nSecurity Agency) digital portal for switching.\no Our total active EPE transactional account base stood at approximately 1.5 million at the end of September 2024, of\nwhich approximately 1.3 million (or approximately 88%) are permanent grant recipients. The balance comprises\nSocial Relief of Distress (“SRD”) grant recipients, which was introduced during the COVID pandemic and extended\nin calendar year 2023.\no Our priority is to grow our permanent grant recipient customers base, where we can build deeper relationships by\noffering products such as insurance and lending. We do not offer the same breadth of service to the SRD grant base\ndue to the temporary nature of the grant.\n38\n Progress on cross selling\nEasyPay Loans\no We originated approximately 286 000 loans during the quarter, with our consumer loan book, before allowances\n(“gross book”), increasing 34% to ZAR 564 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to ZAR 423 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\no We have not amended our credit scoring or other lending criteria, and the growth is reflective of the demand for our\ntailored loan product for this market, growth in EPE bank account customer base and improved cross-selling\ncapabilities.\no The loan conversion rate continues to improve following the implementation of a number of targeted Consumer\nlending campaigns and encouraging results from our digital channels.\no The portfolio loss ratio of approximately 6%, calculated as the loans written off over the last 12 months as a\npercentage of the total gross loan book at the end of the quarter, remained stable on an annualized basis, compared\nto quarter one fiscal 2024.\nEasyPay Insurance\no Our insurance product sales continue to grow and is a material contributor to the improvement in our overall ARPU.\nWe have been able to improve customer penetration to 34% of our active permanent grant account base as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 31% as of September 30, 2023. Approximately 49,000 new policies were written\nin the quarter, compared to approximately 38,000 in the comparable period in fiscal 2024. The total number of active\npolicies has grown 30% to approximately 466,000 policies as of September 30, 2024, compared to 359,000 policies\nas of September 30, 2023.\no In April 2024 we launched a new benefit where existing policyholders and new clients could elect to cover up to six\nof their dependent family members with cover ranging from ZAR 5 000 to ZAR 30 000. Since the launch of this\nbenefit more than 25 00 clients have elected to cover their dependent family members.\nARPU\no ARPU for our permanent client base has increased to approximately ZAR 91 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, from\napproximately ZAR 83 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nAdumo Payouts\no On 1 October the Adumo Payouts business officially became part of the Consumer Division. We are looking forward\nto working with them as we build out the Consumer offering beyond the grant recipient space. The Adumo\ncontribution will be reflected in our quarter two fiscal 2025 results.\nBoard and Leadership Changes in quarter one fiscal 2025\nLeadership changes\nOn October, 1 2024 Dan Smith was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer taking over these responsibilities from Naeem\nKola, who transitioned to Group Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Smith was also appointed to the Board. As Lesaka scales, we will\ncontinue to augment our executive capability to accommodate the growing size of the business and deliver on the opportunity in front\nof us.\nPaul Kent, the CEO of Adumo, joined the Lesaka executive team on completion of the Adumo transaction to oversee the\nMerchant pillar within Lesaka’s Merchant Division.\nBoard changes\nSimilarly, on completion of the Adumo acquisition Dean Sparrow, Group CEO of Crossfin Technology Holdings (RF) (Pty) Ltd,\nwas appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director and joined Lesaka’s Capital Allocation Committee.\nChris Meyer and Monde Nkosi, non-executive directors, stepped down as directors of the Board in October 2024.\n39\nAcquisition of Adumo\nOn October 1, 2024, we announced the closing of the Adumo transaction which enhances our platform, adding customers and\nproducts, as well as scale. The completion of this transaction marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Lesaka story. Adumo will\nbe included in our results for the full second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nGoing forward Lesaka will be run in four distinct pillars\nThe Adumo transaction is the catalyst to approach the market with a more customer-centric operating model. From a financial\nreporting standpoint, we will continue to maintain the Consumer Division and Merchant Division split however we will present our\nKPIs and performance with a more granular breakdown.\nOur Consumer segment will remain substantially the same however the perimeter will be expanded to include the Adumo Payouts\nbusiness.\nIn our Merchant segment, the Adumo transaction provides the opportunity to segment the business into three component parts\norganized around distinct customers. Micro-Merchant, Merchant and Enterprise.\nMicro-merchants are typically sole proprietors, often operating in the informal economy. We address these customers through\nthe Kazang and Touchsides brands. In South Africa the focus will be to augment the product offering and cross-sell to existing\ncustomers so that we can materially improve the unit economics, as we have been doing. Outside of South Africa, in neighboring\ngeographies, there are a substantial number of sole traders who have very limited offerings available to them to empower them on\ntheir digital journey. Here we have an opportunity again to expand our total addressable market through wallet growth.\nThe Merchant pillar is made up of the existing Connect operations, as well as the bulk of Adumo, specifically its merchant\nacquiring and processing business and its GAAP hospitality platform. The Connect business has cash and credit as key product\nofferings, the Adumo business has merchant acquiring and software at point of sale. Combined the Lesaka offering will be amongst\nmost comprehensive in the market in meeting the needs of small and medium size businesses in the region.\nOur Enterprise segment will focus on large corporates, mobile network operators, banks, governments and municipalities. Our\nsolutions include a new payment switch, Prism Switch, our Point Of Sale hardware business branded Prism POS (previously known\nas NUETS), our bill payments platform EasyPay, as well as a third party vending and security business. As well as serving third party\ncorporates it will also service some of the technology needs of our other pillars, Consumer, Micro-Merchant and Merchant.\n40\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the\ndetermination of estimates requires management’s judgment based on a variety of assumptions and other determinants such as\nhistorical experience, current and expected market conditions and certain scientific evaluation techniques. Critical accounting policies\nare those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different\nassumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that are described in more detail in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024:\n Business Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill;\n Intangible Assets Acquired Through Acquisitions;\n Revenue recognition – principal versus agent considerations;\n Valuation of investment in Cell C;\n Recoverability of equity securities and equity-accounted investments;\n Deferred Taxation;\n Stock-based Compensation;\n Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable; and\n Lending.\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted\nRefer to Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of accounting pronouncements\nadopted, including the dates of adoption and the effects on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024\nRefer to Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting\npronouncements not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024, including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Information\nActual exchange rates\nThe actual exchange rates for and at the end of the periods presented were as follows:\nTable 1 Three months ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024\nZAR : $ average exchange rate 17.9601 18.6457 18.7070\nHighest ZAR : $ rate during period 18.5100 19.2202 19.4568\nLowest ZAR : $ rate during period 17.1144 17.6278 17.6278\nRate at end of period 17.1808 18.9236 18.1808\n41\nTranslation exchange rates for financial reporting purposes\nWe are required to translate our results of operations from ZAR to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis. Thus, the average rates used\nto translate this data for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, vary slightly from the averages shown in the table\nabove. Except as described below, the translation rates we use in presenting our results of operations are the rates shown in the\nfollowing table:\nThree months ended Year ended\nTable 2 September 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024\nIncome and expense items: $1 = ZAR 17.7176 18.7088 18.6844\nBalance sheet items: $1 = ZAR 17.1808 18.9236 18.1808\nWe have translated the results of operations and operating segment information for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, provided in the tables below using the actual average exchange rates per month (i.e. for each of July 2024, August 2024,\nand September 2024 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025) between the USD and ZAR in order to reduce the reconciliation of information\npresented to our chief operating decision maker. The impact of using this method compared with the average rate for the quarter and\nyear to date is not significant, however, it does result in minor differences. We believe that presentation using the average exchange\nrates per month compared with the average exchange rate per quarter and year to date improves the accuracy of the information\npresented in our external financial reporting and leads to fewer differences between our external reporting measures which are\nsupplementally presented in ZAR, and our internal management information, which is also presented in ZAR.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion of our consolidated overall results of operations is based on amounts as reflected in our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We analyze our results of operations both in\nU.S. dollars, as presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and supplementally in ZAR, because ZAR is\nthe functional currency of the entities which contribute the majority of our results and is the currency in which the majority of our\ntransactions are initially incurred and measured. Presentation of our reported results in ZAR is a non-GAAP measure. Due to the\nsignificant impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and ZAR on our reported results and because we use the U.S. dollar\nas our reporting currency, we believe that the supplemental presentation of our results of operations in ZAR is useful to investors to\nunderstand the changes in the underlying trends of our business.\n42\nOur operating segment revenue presented in “—Results of operations by operating segment” represents total revenue per\noperating segment before intercompany eliminations. A reconciliation between total operating segment revenue and revenue, as well\nas the reconciliation between our segment performance measure and net loss before tax (benefits) expense, is presented in our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Note 17 to those statements. Our chief operating decision maker is our\nExecutive Chairman and he evaluates segment performance based on segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and\namortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted for items mentioned in the next sentence (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”) for each operating\nsegment. We do not allocate once-off items (as defined below), stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization,\nimpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, other items (including gains or losses on disposal of investments, fair value\nadjustments to equity securities, fair value adjustments to currency options), interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or\nloss from equity-accounted investments to our reportable segments. Once-off items represents non-recurring expense items, including\ncosts related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The Stock-based compensation adjustments\nreflect stock-based compensation expense and are both excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and are therefore\nreported as reconciling items to reconcile the reportable segments’ Segment Adjusted EBITDA to our loss before income tax expense.\nEffective from fiscal 2025, all lease charges are allocated to our operating segments, whereas in fiscal 2024 we presented certain lease\ncharges on a separate line outside of our operating segments. Prior period information has been re-presented to include the lease\ncharges which were previously reported on a separate line in our Consumer and Merchant operating segments.\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA represents Segment Adjusted EBITDA after deducting group costs. Refer also “Results of\nOperations—Use of Non-GAAP Measures” below.\nWe analyze our business and operations in terms of two inter-related but independent operating segments: (1) Merchant Division\nand (2) Consumer Division. In addition, corporate activities that are impracticable to allocate directly to the operating segments, as\nwell as any inter-segment eliminations, are included in Group costs. Inter-segment revenue eliminations are included in Eliminations.\nFirst quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to first quarter of fiscal 2024\nThe following factors had a significant impact on our results of operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared with\nthe same period in the prior year:\n Higher revenue: Our revenues increased 3% in ZAR, primarily due to an increase in value-added services activity and\nprocessing fees in Merchant, as well as higher transaction, insurance and lending revenues in Consumer, which was partially\noffset by fewer low margin prepaid airtime sales;\n Operating income improvement, before transaction costs: Operating income, before Adumo-related transaction costs,\nincreased due to an increase trading activity as noted above;\n Lower net interest charge: Net interest charge decreased to $4.4 million (ZAR 79.8 million) from $4.5 million (ZAR 83.1\nmillion) primarily due to lower interest rates on our borrowings, which was partially offset by higher over borrowings; and\n Foreign exchange movements: The U.S. dollar was 5% stronger against the ZAR during the first quarter of fiscal 2025\ncompared to the prior period, which adversely impacted our U.S. dollar reported results The ZAR was 5% stronger against\nthe U.S. dollar during first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior period, which positively impacted our U.S. dollar\nreported results.\n43\nConsolidated overall results of operations\nThis discussion is based on the amounts prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following tables show the changes in the items comprising our statements of operations, both in U.S. dollars and in ZAR:\nTable 3 In United States Dollars\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 %\n$ ’000 $ ’000 change\nRevenue 145,546 136,089 7%\nCost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support 110,887 107,490 3%\nSelling, general and administration 26,726 22,515 19%\nDepreciation and amortization 6,276 5,856 7%\nTransaction costs related to Adumo acquisition 1,702 - nm\nOperating (loss) income (45) 228 nm\nReversal of allowance for EMI doubtful debt receivable - 250 nm\nInterest income 586 449 31%\nInterest expense 5,032 4,909 3%\nLoss before income tax expense (4,491) (3,982) 13%\nIncome tax expense 78 264 (70%)\nNet loss before earnings (loss) from equity-accounted investments (4,569) (4,246) 8%\nEarnings (Loss) from equity-accounted investments 27 (1,405) nm\nNet loss attributable to us (4,542) (5,651) (20%)\nTable 4 In South African Rand\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 %\nZAR ’000 ZAR ’000 change\nRevenue 2,615,690 2,537,659 3%\nCost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support 1,993,641 2,004,465 (1%)\nSelling, general and administration 479,677 419,861 14%\nDepreciation and amortization 112,660 109,166 3%\nTransaction costs related to Adumo acquisition 29,997 - nm\nOperating (loss) income (285) 4,167 nm\nReversal of allowance for EMI doubtful debt receivable - 4,741 nm\nInterest income 10,517 8,368 26%\nInterest expense 90,328 91,429 (1%)\nLoss before income tax expense (80,096) (74,153) 8%\nIncome tax expense 1,402 4,825 (71%)\nNet loss before earnings (loss) from equity-accounted investments (81,498) (78,978) 3%\nEarnings (Loss) from equity-accounted investments 475 (26,657) nm\nNet loss attributable to us (81,023) (105,635) (23%)\nRevenue increased by $9.5 million (ZAR 78.0 million), or 6.9% (in ZAR, 3.1%), primarily due to an increase in the volume of\nvalue-added services provided (prepaid airtime and gaming), high transactions volumes from our vault and cash management\noperations resulting in higher processing fees, an increase in certain issuing fee base prices and transaction activity in our issuing\nbusiness, and an increase in insurance premiums collected and lending revenues following higher loan originations, which was partially\noffset by fewer low margin prepaid airtime sales. Refer to discussion above at “—Recent Developments” for a description of key\ntrends impacting our revenue this quarter.\nCost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support increased by $3.4 million (or 3.2%) and, in ZAR, decreased by ZAR\n10.8 million (or 0.5%), primarily the decrease in low margin prepaid airtime sales, which was partially by higher insurance-related\nclaims and third-party transaction fees.\nSelling, general and administration expenses increased by $4.2 million (ZAR 59.8 million), or 18.7% (in ZAR 14.2%). The\nincrease was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses (including annual bonuses and annual salary increases) and higher\nstock-based compensation charges; higher consulting, legal and travel expenses, and the year-over-year impact of inflationary\nincreases on certain expenses.\n44\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $0.4 million (ZAR 3.5 million), or 7.2% (3.2%). The increase was due to an\nincrease in depreciation expense related to additional POS devices deployed.\nTransaction costs related to Adumo acquisition includes fees paid to external service providers associated with legal and advisory\nservices procured to close the transaction on October 1, 2024.\nOur operating (loss) income margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was (0.0)% and 0.2%, respectively. We discuss\nthe components of operating loss margin under “—Results of operations by operating segment.”\nWe did not record any changes in the fair value of equity interests in MobiKwik and Cell C during the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nor 2024, respectively. We continue to carry our investment in Cell C at $0 (zero). Refer to Note 4 for the methodology and inputs used\nin the fair value calculation for Cell C.\nInterest on surplus cash increased to $0.6 million (ZAR 10.5 million) from $0.4 million (ZAR 8.4 million), primarily due to\nhigher overall average cash balances on deposit during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with 2024.\nInterest expense increased to $5.0 million from $4.9 million and, in ZAR, decreased to ZAR 90.3 million from ZAR 91.4 million.\nIn ZAR, the decrease was primarily as a result of lower interest expense incurred on certain of our borrowing for which we were able\nto negotiate lower rates of interest towards the end of calendar 2024, which was partially offset by higher overall borrowings during\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with comparable period in the prior quarter.\nFiscal 2025 tax expense was $0.1 million (ZAR 1.4 million) compared to $0.3 million (ZAR 4.8 million) in fiscal 2024. Our\neffective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was impacted by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, a deferred tax\nbenefit related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, non-deductible expenses (in transaction-related expenses), the on-\ngoing losses incurred by certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred\ntax assets recognized regarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was impacted by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South African operations, a\ndeferred tax benefit related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, non-deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred\nby certain of our South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized\nregarding net operating losses incurred by these entities.\nFinbond is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and reports its six-month results during our first quarter and its annual\nresults during our fourth quarter. We sold our entire remaining interest in Finbond during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The table\nbelow presents the relative (loss) earnings from our equity-accounted investments:\nTable 5 Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ %\n$ ’000 $ ’000 change\nFinbond - (1,445) nm\nShare of net loss - (278) nm\nImpairment - (1,167) nm\nOther 27 40 (33%)\nTotal income (loss) from equity-accounted investments 27 (1,405) nm\n45\nResults of operations by operating segment\nThe composition of revenue and the contributions of our business activities to operating loss are illustrated below:\nTable 6 In United States Dollars\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 % of 2023 % of\nOperating Segment $ ’000 total $ ’000 total % change\nConsolidated revenue:\nMerchant 125,261 86% 121,361 89% 3%\nConsumer 21,072 14% 15,580 11% 35%\nSubtotal: Operating segments 146,333 100% 136,941 100% 7%\nEliminations (787) - (852) - (8%)\nTotal consolidated revenue 145,546 100% 136,089 100% 7%\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA:\nMerchant(1)(2) 7,916 84% 7,725 96% 2%\nConsumer(1)(2) 4,396 47% 2,120 26% 107%\nGroup costs (2,949) (31%) (1,822) (22%) 62%\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 9,363 100% 8,023 100% 17%\n(1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Merchant and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Consumer include retrenchment costs of $0.01\nmillion and $0.06 million, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n(2) Lease expenses which were previously presented on a separately line in fiscal 2024 are now included in Merchant and\nConsumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA.

The prior period has been re-presented to conform with current period presentation.\n(3) Group Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, refer to reconciliation below at “—Results of Operations—Use of Non-\nGAAP Measures”.\nMerchant\nSegment revenue primarily increased due to a higher volume of value-added services provided (prepaid airtime and gaming),\nand high transactions volumes from our vault and cash management operations resulting in higher processing fees, which was partially\noffset by fewer low margin prepaid airtime sales. In ZAR, the modest decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due higher\noperating expenses incurred, especially employment-related expenditures, to expand our offering, which was partially offset by higher\ngross margin (calculated as revenue less cost of goods sold, IT processing, servicing and support). Connect records a significant\nproportion of its airtime sales in revenue (see further below) and cost of sales, while only earning a relatively small margin. This\nsignificantly depresses the Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins shown by the business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we\nexperience a shift in the mix between the sale of pinned prepaid airtime and distribution of pinless prepaid airtime, with the volume\nof pinned airtime sales decreasing, which results in a lower revenue and related cost of sales, and an overall improved margin.\n46\nOur Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as Segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2025 and 2024 was 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively.\nPrepaid airtime sales\nIn South Africa and other countries, mobile network operators (“MNOs”) offer prepaid or contract (or postpaid) services to their\ncustomers to telephony services using a mobile telephony network or networks. MNOs also offer similar products (prepaid or postpaid)\nfor mobile data which uses other wireless network protocols such as wireless fidelity (“wifi”). We use the term “prepaid airtime” to\ninclude both of these prepaid products.\nGenerally speaking, the difference between the two models is that prepaid is paid for upfront by the customer and contract is paid\nin arrears. MNOs sell prepaid products directly to their customers and also indirectly to their customers through distribution channels\n(which include wholesalers, retailers and other parties, including ourselves).\nWe sell a variety of products through our distribution channels, including prepaid airtime, prepaid electricity, gaming vouchers.\nWe refer to these products collectively as VAS.\nIn order to “load” airtime onto a mobile device an MNOs customer requires a prepaid airtime voucher. A unique code is assigned\nto each prepaid airtime voucher and is required to activate the prepaid airtime on a mobile device. Like certain tangible goods, once\nsold, our customers cannot return prepaid airtime vouchers to us (except of course if there is a defect in the service provided by us,\nwhich rarely occurs).\nWe can either purchase an agreed quantity of prepaid airtime vouchers upfront directly from wholesalers or other parties (so\ncalled “Pinned airtime” - these electronic vouchers are stored on a server owned and maintained by us and we treat these vouchers as\ninventory) or we can “interface” directly into a wholesaler and deliver the airtime voucher directly to our customers (typically\nmerchants) as the airtime is sold by the merchant to MNOs customers (so called Pinless airtime).\nConsumer\nSegment revenue increased primarily due to higher transaction fees generated from the higher EPE account holders base, an\nincrease in certain issuing fee base prices and transaction activity in our issuing business, insurance premiums collected and lending\nrevenues following an increase in loan originations. This increase in revenue has translated into improved profitability, which was\npartially offset by higher insurance-related claims and interest expenses (of approximately ZAR 15.0 million) incurred to fund our\nlending book and the year-over-year impact of inflationary increases on certain expenses. We intend to obtain a separate lending\nfacility to fund a portion of our lending during fiscal 2025. We expected to have this facility in place on July 1, 2024, however, we\nhave been unable to finalize terms as the separate lending facility will form part of a broader financing package. Therefore, we have\nincluded an intercompany interest expense in our Consumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nOur Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 20.9% and 13.6%, respectively.\nGroup costs\nOur group costs primarily include employee related costs in relation to employees specifically hired for group roles and costs\nrelated directly to managing the US-listed entity; expenditures related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; non-\nemployee directors’ fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit fees; and directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums.\nOur group costs for fiscal 2025 increased compared with the prior period due to higher employee costs resulting from an increase\nin the number of individuals allocated to group costs and base salary adjustments, higher bonus expense, travel, consulting and legal\nfees.\n47\nPresentation of Merchant and Consumer by segment for fiscal 2024 and 2023 including lease charges\nThe tables below present Merchant and Consumer EBITDA for fiscal 2024 and 2023, including lease charges, as well as the\nU.S. dollar/ ZAR exchange rates applicable per fiscal quarter and year:\nTable 8 Fiscal 2024\nIn United States dollars\nQuarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 F2024\n$ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA:\nMerchant 7,725 8,388 8,145 7,843 32,101\nConsumer 2,120 2,575 3,757 4,227 12,679\nGroup costs (1,822) (2,011) (2,199) (1,812) (7,844)\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 8,023 8,952 9,703 10,258 36,936\nIncome and expense items: $1 = ZAR 18.71 18.71 18.88 18.47 18.68\nTable 9 Fiscal 2023\nIn United States dollars\nQuarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 F2023\n$ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000 $ ’000\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA:\nMerchant 7,580 8,780 7,980 7,924 32,264\nConsumer (1,893) 171 1,263 2,134 1,675\nGroup costs (2,300) (2,256) (2,293) (2,260) (9,109)\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 3,387 6,695 6,950 7,798 24,830\nIncome and expense items: $1 = ZAR 17.13 17.52 17.93 18.74 17.94\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nU.S. securities laws require that when we publish any non-GAAP measures, we disclose the reason for using these non-GAAP\nmeasures and provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The presentation of Group Adjusted EBITDA\nis a non-GAAP measure. We provide this non-GAAP measure to enhance our evaluation and understanding of our financial\nperformance and trends. We believe that this measure is helpful to users of our financial information understand key operating\nperformance and trends in our business because it excludes certain non-cash expenses (including depreciation and amortization and\nstock-based compensation charges) and income and expenses that we consider once-off in nature.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted for non-\noperational transactions (including loss on disposal of equity-accounted investments, gain related to fair value adjustments to currency\noptions), (earnings) loss from equity-accounted investments, stock-based compensation charges and once-off items. Once-off items\nrepresents non-recurring income and expense items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately\nnot pursued.\n48\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between GAAP net loss attributable to Lesaka to Group Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 10 Three months ended\n2024 2023\n$ ’000 $ ’000\nLoss attributable to Lesaka - GAAP (4,542) (5,651)\n(Earnings) loss from equity accounted investments (27) 1,405\nNet loss before (earnings) loss from equity-accounted investments (4,569) (4,246)\nIncome tax expense 78 264\nLoss before income tax expense (4,491) (3,982)\nInterest expense 5,032 4,909\nInterest income (586) (449)\nReversal of allowance for doubtful EMI loan receivable - (250)\nOperating income (loss) (45) 228\nPPA amortization (amortization of acquired intangible assets) 3,747 3,608\nDepreciation and amortization 2,529 2,248\nStock-based compensation charges 2,377 1,759\nInterest adjustment (831) -\nOnce-off items(1) 1,805 78\nUnrealized (gain) loss FV for currency adjustments (219) 102\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP 9,363 8,023\n(1) The table below presents the components of once-off items for the periods presented:\nTable 11 Three months ended\n2024 2023\n$ ’000 $ ’000\nTransaction costs 103 78\nTransaction costs related to Adumo acquisition 1,702 -\nTotal once-off items 1,805 78\nOnce-off items are non-recurring in nature, however, certain items may be reported in multiple quarters. For instance, transaction\ncosts include costs incurred related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The transactions can span\nmultiple quarters, for instance in fiscal 2025 we incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition of Adumo over a\nnumber of quarters, and the transactions are generally non-recurring.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were $49.7 million and comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated balances\nof $2.0 million, ZAR-denominated balances of ZAR 791.0 million ($46.0 million), and other currency deposits, primarily Botswana\npula, of $1.7 million, all amounts translated at exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in our unrestricted\ncash balances from June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the utilization of cash reserves to fund certain scheduled and other repayments\nof our borrowings, purchase ATMs and vaults, pay annual bonuses, pay for expenses included in our group costs, and to make an\ninvestment in working capital, which was partially offset by positive contribution from our Merchant and Consumer operations and\nutilization.\nWe generally invest any surplus cash held by our South African operations in overnight call accounts that we maintain at South\nAfrican banking institutions, and any surplus cash held by our non-South African companies in U.S. dollar-denominated money market\naccounts.\nHistorically, we have financed most of our operations, research and development, working capital, and capital expenditures, as\nwell as acquisitions and strategic investments, through internally generated cash and our financing facilities. When considering\nwhether to borrow under our financing facilities, we consider the cost of capital, cost of financing, opportunity cost of utilizing surplus\ncash and availability of tax efficient structures to moderate financing costs. For instance, in fiscal 2022, we obtained loan facilities\nfrom RMB to fund a portion of our acquisition of Connect. Following the acquisition of Connect, we now utilize a combination of\nshort and long-term facilities to fund our operating activities and a long-term asset-backed facility to fund the acquisition of POS\ndevices and vaults. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024, for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings.\n49\nAvailable short-term borrowings\nSummarized below are our short-term facilities available and utilized as of September 30, 2024:\nTable 12 RMB Facility E RMB Indirect RMB Connect Nedbank\n$ ’000 ZAR ’000 $ ’000 ZAR ’000 $ ’000 ZAR ’000 $ ’000 ZAR ’000\nTotal short-term facilities\navailable, comprising:\nOverdraft - - - - 9,895 170,000 - -\nOverdraft restricted as to\nuse(1) 52,384 900,000 - - - - - -\nTotal overdraft 52,384 900,000 - - 9,895 170,000 - -\nIndirect and derivative\nfacilities(2) - - 7,858 135,000 - - 9,112 156,556\nTotal short-term\nfacilities available 52,384 900,000 7,858 135,000 9,895 170,000 9,112 156,556\nUtilized short-term\nfacilities:\nOverdraft - - - - 9,895 170,000 - -\nIndirect and derivative\nfacilities(2) - - 1,927 33,100 - - 123 2,110\nTotal short-term\nfacilities available - - 1,927 33,100 9,895 170,000 123 2,110\nInterest rate, based on 11.50% 11.40%\n(1) Overdraft may only be used to fund ATMs and upon utilization is considered restricted cash. We did not utilize this facility\nat the end of September 2024, and expect to cancel the facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n(2) Indirect and derivative facilities may only be used for guarantees, letters of credit and forward exchange contracts to support\nguarantees issued by RMB and Nedbank to various third parties on our behalf.\nLong-term borrowings\nWe have aggregate long-term borrowing outstanding of ZAR 2.6 billion ($148.5 million translated at exchange rates as of\nSeptember 30, 2024) as described in Note 8. These borrowings include outstanding long-term borrowings obtained by Lesaka SA of\nZAR 1.0 billion, including accrued interest, which was used to partially fund the acquisition of Connect. The Lesaka SA borrowing\narrangements were amended in March 2023 to include a ZAR 200 million revolving credit facility. We have settled all drawn amounts\nin full as of September 30, 2024, with the full balance available for utilization in the future. In contemplation of the Connect transaction,\nConnect obtained total facilities of ZAR 1.3 billion, which were utilized to repay its existing borrowings, to fund a portion of its capital\nexpenditures and to settle obligations under the transaction documents, and which has subsequently been upsized for its operational\nrequirements and has an outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024, of ZAR 1.2 billion, We also have a revolving credit facility,\nof ZAR 300.0 million which is utilized to fund a portion of our merchant finance loans receivable book.\nOn September 30, 2024, we obtained a ZAR 665.0 million funding facility from RMB which has been used on October 1, 2024\nto (i) settle an amount of ZAR 232.2 million due to the Adumo sellers; (ii) pay ZAR 207.2 million to acquire 2,601,410 shares of our\ncommon stock from one of the Adumo sellers’ indirect shareholders; (iii) pay ZAR 147.5 million notified by Investec Bank Limited\nto Adumo and us as a result of the acquisition, (iv) pay an origination fee of ZAR 7.6 million to RMB and (v) pay ZAR 70.0 million\nof transaction-related expenses.\nRestricted cash\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had credit facilities with RMB in order to access cash to fund our ATMs in South Africa. Utilization\nof this facility is included in our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. We\ndid not utilize the facility at the end of September 2024. Any cash drawn under the facility may only be used to fund ATMs and is\nconsidered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe have also entered into cession and pledge agreements with Nedbank related to our Nedbank indirect credit facilities and we\nhave ceded and pledged certain bank accounts to Nedbank. The funds included in these bank accounts are restricted as they may not\nbe withdrawn without the express permission of Nedbank. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in our consolidated\nstatement of cash flows as of September 30, 2024, includes restricted cash of $0.1 million that has been ceded and pledged.\n50\nArrangement with African Bank to fund our ATMs\nIn September 2024, we entered into an arrangement with African Bank Limited (“African Bank”) and certain cash-in-transit\nservice providers to fund our ATMs. Under this arrangement, African Bank will use its cash resources to fund our ATMs and it is\nspecifically recorded that the cash in our ATMs are African Bank’s property. Therefore, as we have not utilized a facility to obtain the\ncash, and do not own or control the cash for an extended period of time, we do not record cash or cash equivalents and borrowings in\nour consolidated statement of financial position. Cash withdrawn from our ATMs by our EPE customers and other consumers are\nsettled through the interbank settlement system from the ATM users bank account to African Bank’s bank accounts. We pay African\nBank a monthly fee for the service provided which is calculated based on the cumulative daily outstanding balance of cash utilized\nmultiplied by the South African prime interest rate less 1%. We are exposed to the risk of cash lost while it is in our ATMs (i.e. from\ntheft) and are required to repay African Bank for any shortages.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFirst quarter\nNet cash used operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $4.1 million (ZAR 73.3 million) compared to net\ncash provided by operating activities of $3.4 million (ZAR 63.1 million) during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact\nof income taxes, our cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 includes cash utilized for the settlement of\nworking capital movements within our merchant business related to quarter-end transaction processing activities and which were\nsettled in the following week (our fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 closed on a Sunday), and the net growth in our consumer and merchant\nfinance loans receivable books, which was partially offset by was positively impacted by the contribution from Merchant and\nConsumer businesses.\nWe didn’t pay any significant taxes during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we paid second\nprovisional South African tax payments of $- million (ZAR - million) related to certain Connect entities’ 2024 tax year that had not\nyet been aligned with ours.\nTaxes (refunded) paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 were as follows:\nTable 13 Three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ ZAR ZAR\n‘000 ‘000 ‘000 ‘000\nTaxation paid related to prior years - 572 - 10,859\nTax refund received (113) (31) (2,053) (640)\nTotal South African taxes paid (113) 541 (2,053) 10,219\nForeign taxes paid 68 63 1,213 1,196\nTotal tax (refund) paid (45) 604 (840) 11,415\nCash flows from investing activities\nFirst quarter\nCash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included capital expenditures of $4.0 million (ZAR 70.3\nmillion), primarily due to the acquisition of vaults and POS devices.\nCash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included capital expenditures of $2.8 million (ZAR 52.6\nmillion), primarily due to the acquisition of vaults.\n51\nCash flows from financing activities\nFirst quarter\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we utilized $23.9 million from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs\nand our cash management business through Connect, and repaid $31.0 million of those facilities. We utilized $0.8 million of our long-\nterm borrowings to fund the acquisition of certain capital expenditures and for working capital requirements. We repaid $5.5 million\nof long-term borrowings in accordance with our repayment schedule as well as to settle a portion of our revolving credit facility\nutilized.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we utilized $59.6 million from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs\nand our cash management business through Connect, and repaid $62.8 million of those facilities. We utilized approximately $2.5\nmillion of our long-term borrowings to fund the acquisition of certain capital expenditures and for working capital requirements. We\nrepaid approximately $2.6 million of long-term borrowings in accordance with our repayment schedule as well as to settle a portion\nof our revolving credit facility utilized.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe expect capital spending for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to primarily include spending for acquisition of POS devices,\nvaults, computer software, computer and office equipment, as well as for our ATM infrastructure and branch network in South Africa.\nOur capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 are discussed under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash\nflows from investing activities.” All of our capital expenditures for the past three fiscal years were funded through internally generated\nfunds, or, following the Connect acquisition, our asset-backed borrowing arrangement. We had outstanding capital commitments as\nof September 30, 2024, of $0.3 million. We expect to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds and available\nfacilities.\n52\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn addition to the tables below, see Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of\nmarket risk.\nWe have short and long-term borrowings in South Africa which attract interest at rates that fluctuate based on changes in the\nSouth African prime and 3-month JIBAR interest rates. The following table illustrates the effect on our annual expected interest charge,\ntranslated at exchange rates applicable as of September 30, 2024, as a result of changes in the South African prime and 3-month JIBAR\ninterest rates, using our outstanding short and long-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024. The effect of a hypothetical 1% (i.e.\n100 basis points) increase and a 1% decrease in the interest rates applicable to the borrowings as of September 30, 2024, are shown.\nThe selected 1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best- or worst-case scenarios.\nTable 14 As of September 30, 2024\nEstimated annual\nexpected interest\ncharge after\nAnnual expected Hypothetical hypothetical change\ninterest charge change in in interest rates\n($ ’000) interest rates ($ ’000)\nInterest on South African borrowings 19,780 1% 21,367\n(1%) 18,190\n53\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our executive chairman and our group chief\nfinancial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024.\nWe previously identified and disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024,\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to: (1) information technology general controls (“ITGCs”),\nspecifically insufficient risk assessment, design and implementation, monitoring activities and training of individuals to operate\ncontrols in the areas of user access and program-change management for certain information technology systems that support our\nfinancial reporting processes and (2) insufficient design and implementation of controls and associated policies and procedures in our\nannual goodwill impairment assessment. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs a result of insufficient time to design and implement procedures to remediate the material weaknesses discussed in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (as described above), the executive chairman and the group chief financial\nofficer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024.\nNotwithstanding the previously identified material weaknesses, management believes the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have commenced with the design and implementation of the remediation plan during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 which includes:\n- the review of ITGCs and implementation of changes to certain controls to address the issues related to the material\nweaknesses identified above; and\n- the review and implementation of changes to the design of the controls related to the goodwill impairment assessment.\nThe remediation plan may be adjusted as is appropriate, as we continue to evaluate and enhance our internal control over financial\nreporting. Other than the design and implementation of the remediation plan, there have not been any changes in our internal control\nover financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n54\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nSee “Item 1A RISK FACTORS” in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, for a\ndiscussion of risk factors relating to (i) our business, (ii) operating in South Africa and other foreign markets, (iii) government\nregulation, and (iv) our common stock. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously\ndisclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate Adumo’s operations with our business.\nOn October 1, 2024, we announced the closing of our ZAR 1.67 billion ($96.2 million) investment to acquire a 100% interest in\nAdumo. Integrating Adumo into our company may require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their\nattention from our day-to-day business. The difficulties of integration may be increased by cultural differences between our two\norganizations and the necessity of retaining and integrating personnel, including Adumo’s key employees and management team. The\nservices of these individuals will be important to the continued growth and success of Adumo’s business and to our ability to integrate\nAdumo with us. If we were to lose the services of these key employees or fail to sufficiently integrate them, our ability to operate\nAdumo successfully would likely be materially and adversely impacted.\nAs such, if we are unable to successfully integrate Adumo’s operations into our business we could be required to record material\nimpairments, and as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could suffer.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm\nour business.\nWe obtain our smart cards, ATMs, electronic payment and POS devices, components for our safe assets, components to repair\nthe ISV (independent software vendor) division’s POS hardware, and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number\nof suppliers, and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our manufacturers\nor component suppliers. If our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when\nwe need them, or if they increase their prices, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced\nwith a critical shortage. This could harm our ability to meet customer demand and cause our revenues to decline. Even if we are able\nto secure alternative sources in a timely manner, our costs could increase as a result of supply or geopolitical shocks, which may lead\nto an increase in the prices of goods and services from third parties. A supply interruption, such as the recent global shortage of\nsemiconductors, or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers’ capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment\nand thus to acquire new customers who use our technology. Any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our\ntechnology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the\ndemand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have a South African banking license and, therefore, we provide our EPE solution through an arrangement with\na third-party bank, which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it. If this arrangement were\nto terminate, we would not be able to operate our EPE business without alternate means of access to a banking license. We are\nalso required to comply with the requirements of payment schemes, including VISA and Mastercard. Furthermore, we provide\ncertain of our services under partnerships with South African banks. We will be unable to provide our payments and card-acquiring\nbusinesses if we fail to comply with payment scheme rules, and/or fails to maintain certain regulatory licenses and registrations,\nand/ or if we were unable to continue to partner with South African banks to provide our payments and card acquiring services.\nThe South African retail banking market is highly regulated. Under current law and regulations, our EasyPay Everywhere\n(“EPE”) business activities require us to be registered as a bank in South Africa or to have access to an existing banking license. We\nare not currently so registered, but we have an agreement with Grindrod Bank, a subsidiary of African Bank Limited, that enables us\nto implement our EPE program in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. If this agreement were to be terminated, we\nwould not be able to operate these services unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means.\nFurthermore, we have to comply with the South African Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 2001 and money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing control regulations, when we open new bank accounts for our customers and when they transact. Failure to effectively\nimplement and monitor responses to the legislation and regulations may result in significant fines or prosecution of Grindrod Bank\nand ourselves.\nWe are required to comply with the requirements of payment schemes, including VISA and Mastercard. We have deployed a\nsignificant number of devices, and any mandatory compliance upgrades to our deployed POS devices would require significant capital\nexpenditures and/or be disruptive to our customer base. Failure to comply with the payment schemes’ rules may result in significant\nfines and/or a loss of license to participate in the scheme(s).\n55\nWe provide card acquiring services to our customers by partnering with Nedbank Limited and ABSA Bank Limited, and payment\nprocessing services in partnership with the largest banks in South Africa. If these agreements were to be terminated, Adumo would\nnot be able to operate its payment services unless it were able to obtain alternative card acquiring or payment processing agreements\nwith other partners or obtain a direct designation license with the scheme's and regulatory bodies. In addition, if we were to lose our\nPASA registrations or fail to have them renewed, it would be unable to operate its payment services.\nCompliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and\nfailure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines\nand/or civil or criminal liability.\nIn addition, the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002, requires persons who act as\nintermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in South Africa to register as financial service providers. EasyPay\nInsurance was granted a Financial Service Provider, or FSP, license on June 9, 2015, and EasyPay Financial Services (Pty) Ltd was\ngranted a FSP license on July 11, 2017. If our FSP licenses are withdrawn or suspended, we may be stopped from continuing our\nfinancial services businesses in South Africa unless we are able to enter into a representative arrangement with a third party FSP.\nFurthermore, the proposed Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill will make significant changes to the current licensing regime\nhowever, the current proposal is that existing licences will be converted. The second draft of the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill\nwas published for public comment on September 29, 2020.\nItem 5.

The ZAR\nstrengthened 5.3% against the U.S. dollar during Q1 2025 when compared to Q1 2024.\nLesaka Chairman Ali Mazanderani said: “We continue to invest in building the Lesaka platform and to scale as Southern Africa’s\nleading independent fintech. We achieved the mid-point of our revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q1 2025. We have\nnow delivered on our Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for nine successive quarters and reaffirm our FY 2025 revenue guidance of\nZAR 10 billion to ZAR 11 billion and FY2025 Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance of ZAR 900 million to ZAR 1 billion. Our Net\nRevenue guidance of ZAR 5.2 million to ZAR 5.6 million for FY 2025 implies 35% year-on year growth at the midpoint of this range.\nOur Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for FY 2025 implies 37% growth, year-on-year, at the midpoint of the range.”\nOutlook: Second Quarter 2025 (“Q2 2025”) and reaffirming Full Fiscal Year 2025 (“FY 2025”) outlook\nWhile we report our financial results in USD, we measure our operating performance in ZAR, and as such we provide our guidance\naccordingly.\nWe have included guidance for Net Revenue, a non-GAAP measure, for the first time. This primarily eliminates the effect of changes\nin revenue mix between agency and principal sales of airtime, which can be material.\nFor Q2 2025, the quarter ending December 31, 2024 we expect:\n• Revenue between ZAR 2.4 billion and ZAR 2.6 billion.\n• Net Revenue between ZAR 1.2 billion and ZAR 1.4 billion.\n• Group Adjusted EBITDA between ZAR 190 million and ZAR 210 million.\nGuidance For FY 2025, the year ending June 30, 2025, we expect:\n• Revenue between ZAR 10.0 billion and ZAR 11.0 billion.\n• Net Revenue between ZAR 5.2 billion and ZAR 5.6 billion.\n• Group Adjusted EBITDA between ZAR 900 million and ZAR 1 billion\nOur outlook provided:\n• Includes the impact of the acquisition of Adumo, which closed in October 2024 (in Q2 2025).\n• Excludes the impact of unannounced mergers and acquisitions that we may conclude.\nThe mid-point of the FY 2025 Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance implies a growth rate of more than 30% on a like-for-like basis\n(excluding Adumo and the allocation of interest expense charges directly related to the consumer loan book).\nManagement has provided its outlook regarding Net Revenue and Group Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures\nand excludes certain revenue and charges. Management has not reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items is not provided. Management is unable to provide guidance\nfor these reconciling items because they cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of the company's\ncontrol and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations\nto the corresponding GAAP financial measure are not available without unreasonable effort.\nEarnings Presentation for Q1 2025 Results\nOur earnings presentation will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website prior to our earnings call.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nLesaka will host a webcast and conference call to review results on November 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time which is 3:00 p.m.\nSouth Africa Standard Time (“SAST”).

          "content": "Bronwyn Nielsen\nHello everyone and welcome to the Lesaka Technologies webcast and conference call for the first quarter of fiscal\n2025.\nAs a reminder the webcast is being recorded and the presentation can be accessed through the webcast link as\nwell as dialling into the zoom conference call dial-in numbers provided. Management will address any questions\nyou may have at the end of the presentation. For those joining us via the webcast, you can ask your questions\nlive by “raising your hand” in zoom. For those joining via the zoom teleconference line, you cannot ask your\nquestions live.\nThe webcast link, zoom conference call dial-in numbers as well as our press release and supplementary investor\npresentation are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.lesakatech.com. Additionally, Lesaka filed its\nForm 10-Q after the U.S. market close yesterday, which is also available on our Investor Relations website.\nAs a reminder, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and I ask you to look at the\ncautionary language contained in our Form 10-Q regarding the risks and uncertainties associated with forward-\nlooking statements.\nAlso, as a domestic filer in the United States, we report results in U.S. dollars, under US GAAP. However, it is\nimportant to note that our operational currency is South African rand and as such we analyze our performance\nin South African rand. In this presentation, we will discuss our results in South African rand, which is non-GAAP.\nThis assists investors' understanding of the underlying trends in our business. As you know, the company's results\ncan be significantly affected by the currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the South African rand.\n1\nSlide 3 Bronwyn – AGENDA\nTaking a look at today’s agenda: Ali Mazanderani, Chairman of Lesaka, will give an overview of the quarter. Steve\nHeilbron, Head of Corporate Development will provide an update on the Merchant Division, followed by Lincoln\nMali, CEO of Lesaka Southern Africa, who will take us through the Consumer Division’s performance. Dan Smith,\nGroup CFO, will present an overview of our financial performance for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and provide an update on guidance. Thereafter we will open the call for Q&A.\nI’d like to now turn the call over to Ali.\nGood morning and good afternoon, and welcome to our FY25 first quarter earnings webcast and conference call.\nSlide 6: Continuation of our strong and consistent performance - ALI\nGood morning and good afternoon.\nFY2025 is another transformative year for Lesaka and I am pleased that in the first quarter we have delivered on\nour representations by meeting the mid-point of our guidance at both a revenue and EBITDA level.\nWe achieved revenue of R2.6bn and EBITDA of R168m and excluding transaction costs from Adumo, operating\nincome of R30m, compared to R4m in Q12024 and Fundamental Earnings of R43m from a loss of R5m in\nQ1FY2024.\nWe signposted last quarter that we would introduce in this quarter, a new measure to help augment gross\nrevenue as a representation of top line growth. In this respect we are disclosing for the first time Net Revenue,\nwhich we believe will achieve that objective better than Gross Profit. Net Revenue is defined as Gross Revenue\nless the cost of prepaid airtime sold by us and commissions paid to third parties selling our VAS products.\nOur Net Revenue for Q12025 was R1,056m representing a growth of 16% from Q12024. This indicates an average\nEBITDA/Net Revenue margin across the group of c.16% in Q12025. We see considerable opportunity to increase\nthat margin over time as we further scale the platform, increase our competitive moat and evolve the multi-\nproduct offering.\nSlide 7: Our platform and solutions are positioned to win - ALI\nWe are building a multiproduct platform that is organized around the customer. As a reminder, we have two\nsegments of customers: Consumers and Businesses, and within the Business segment we now further\ndifferentiate between Micro-Merchants, Merchants and Enterprises.\n2\nIn FY2025 we expect the consumer segment to contribute approximately one third to Segment adjusted EBITDA\nand the Business segment approximately two thirds. Today we serve 1.7m consumers and 122k merchants and\nwhile there is an enormous opportunity for us to grow the base of customers materially in both, given the total\naddressable market (TAM) in the markets we operate in, there is also an enormous opportunity to increase the\nvalue we provide to our customers by delivering an integrated multi-product offering.\nToday we don’t just provide consumers with transactional accounts, we also offer loans and insurance as an\nexample. We don’t just provide merchants with card acceptance, we also offer cash management, credit,\nsoftware and VAS services. The more integrated our product offering is to our customers, the more successful\nwe will be.\nAnd the consequence of successfully executing on a multi-product strategy organized around the customer will\nbe to provide a truly differentiated service that disrupts an already scale and profitable market enabling us to\ncompete on value rather than price. It will allow us to transform unit economics and return on capital by reducing\nthe cost of customer acquisition, increasing the take rate we generate, and reducing customer churn.\nWithin the Lesaka stable we already had a range of products that addressed a number of customer needs. With\nthe completion of the Adumo acquisition that suite of products has substantially increased. Thus, in FY2025 our\noperational focus is on integration. It is about ensuring we have the right foundation to deliver on our potential.\nIt is about ensuring we are providing a standout value proposition with best-in-class economics, rather than\nrapidly scaling the base, although that time is coming.\nWe are truly fortunate that in a year where we are focused on integration, product offering and unit economics\nwe can still provide guidance for FY2025 Net Revenue and EBITDA growth that is more than 30% YoY, as Dan will\ntalk to in our guidance section. We are in the enviable position of being able to grow profitably while investing\nfor our future.\nSlide 8: Lesaka platform is strategically positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds - ALI\nAnd the future is bright. Africa represents the fastest growth fintech opportunity in the world and\nwe are also wonderfully positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds and structural advantages. We are\npositioning the business to benefit from the continued digitization of the economies in which we operate.\nCash is still a pervasive medium of exchange in Africa with a higher utilization than anywhere else in the world.\nOur bet is that it will decrease, and that this will increase the need for merchant solutions which traditional banks\nare poorly equipped to address. The combination of banks being generally product centric organizations, who\nhave built their technology on legacy architecture, where they will cannibalize existing profit pools by disrupting\n3\nthe market, and where they rely on generic, rather than specialized, distribution channels, poorly positions them\nto solve the needs of merchants in a digitalizing world.\nThis is the global experience. In 2011, 97% of the 50 largest merchant acquirers in the world were banks. By\n2022, this number reduced to 43%.\nThese are themes which we have seen happen time and time again in market after market, whether in developed\nmarkets like the US, the UK or the European Economic Area, or in emerging markets like Mexico, Brazil or Egypt.\nThe story is the same. Seismic shifts have occurred in the industry globally and we do not believe Southern Africa\nwill be a unique outlier. While there is some uncertainty on the velocity of travel, the trajectory is clear. The\nmarkets we operate in will digitize, they are forecast to digitalize faster than other parts of the world, and\ntraditional bank incumbents will capture a decreasing share of that market. In South Africa where these are\nalready scaled and very profitable players, there is the opportunity to, not just grow the market, by providing\naugmentative products but there is also the opportunity to disrupt an existing profit pool. As the leading\nindependent fintech in Southern Africa, with the broadest product offering, our destiny should be, to be at the\nvanguard of this transformation.\nOver to you Steve.\nSteve Heilbron\nSlide 9: Merchant Division\nThank you Ali.\nFirstly, I would like to again formally welcome Paul Kent and the Adumo and GAAP teams to Lesaka. The\ntransaction closed on October 1, 2024. Adumo will form part of the group for the second quarter and will be\nreflected in our Q2 results, presented in February next year.\nWe have already held numerous sales and product workshops, and leadership interactions including having Paul\nKent join our Group Exco. We are encouraged by these initial engagements and look forward to further\ndeveloping our formal market merchant offering.\nSlide 10: South Africa remains underpenetrated with huge addressable opportunities.\nI would like to support what Ali has spoken to in a merchant context. We operate in a large and growing market,\nwithin which we believe global fintech trends will playout in Southern Africa. We have invested significantly over\nthe past two and a half years into building our platform comprising a unique comprehensive offering across the\n4\nmerchant spectrum. We continue to invest, innovate and evolve, to position ourselves, to optimize on, the\nopportunities ahead of us.\nWe operate in an estimated SAM of almost 900,000 merchants, who experience daily pain points and\ninefficiencies in running their businesses. This includes limited access to digital payments, poor cash\nmanagement solutions, limited access to capital and the lack of availability to a holistic offering.\nOur comprehensive merchant solutions solve for these pain points, and we are making a real difference in our\nmerchants’ lives.\nSlide 11: Uniquely positioned | Holistic offering and innovative solutions to merchants\nCritical to our strategy is the broad offering we have for our merchants. We have competitors on an individual\nproduct basis, but our holistic solution is proving to be both durable and an effective differentiator.\nWith the closing of the Adumo transaction Lesaka now has a leading position in both the micro-merchant sector,\nin the informal market, and in the small-to-medium merchant sector, in the formal market. This is complemented\nby a growing presence in the enterprise market.\nWe now serve over 122,000 merchants, processing over R270 billion annually across Southern Africa. Success in\nfintech is predicated on capturing scale at compelling growth rates. Through continuous innovation and\ninvestment in our ecosystem we believe our platform is well positioned to take advantage of the secular fintech\ntrends.\nAs a fintech company, this comprehensive approach is unique and disruptive – from cash vaults and immediate\ndigitalization, quick access to capital for growth opportunities, a comprehensive VAS product suite to attract\ncustomers to merchants' stores, supplier payments and industry-leading payment technologies. We offer\ninnovative solutions that make a meaningful difference to our merchant's daily trading, risk management, and\nbusiness administration. We will entrench and extend our position in the informal and formal micro-and-small-\nto-medium merchant markets by continuing to embed ourselves as their partner.\nSlide 12: Merchant revenue drivers Q1 FY25 | VAS and supplier payments\nTurning to our KPIs, this quarter, we have split the throughput on our Kazang devices into traditional VAS, supplier\npayments and international money transfers, given that the supplier payments have become a major contributor\nto our throughput, and we expect continued growth.\n5\nWe offer a wide range of VAS products through our Kazang devices aimed at attracting customers into our\nmerchants’ stores, This includes airtime, data, electricity, gaming, lotto, money transfers and bill payments.\nOur devices in field increased 16% y-o-y, this includes the Touchsides base of approximately 5 400 devices that\nwe have not converted onto the Kazang platform. This presents an immediate opportunity. We have successfully\nconverted approximately 1 500 Touchsides sites to Kazang devices in Q1. In addition to rolling-out our traditional\nVAS offering, the more significant opportunity in the Touchsides sites is in card acquiring and data monetization.\nOur total throughput increased 38% year-on-year, driven largely by our supplier payments and international\nmoney transfer offerings, each growing throughput by over R1 billion year-on-year.\nOur supplier payments throughput increased 60% to R3.2 billon for the quarter. We have over 1 000 suppliers\non our platform allowing our micro-merchants to significantly reduce time-consuming administration and the\ninherent risks of dealing in large amounts of cash in their environment. Although attracting a lower margin than\ntraditional VAS sales, this forms a key part of our strategy to attract merchants and increase their utilization of a\nbroader spectrum of our product set, driving growth and increased flows in quarters to come. Investment into\ngrowing our supplier payments ecosystem and vaulting infrastructure is integral to this strategy, and facilitates\nthe pull through from cash to card.\nVAS throughput, excluding supplier payments and international money transfers, increased 10% year-on-year to\nR5.4 billion. We have seen increased competition in this space as expected given that South Africa’s merchant\nmarket remains underpenetrated with a meaningful addressable opportunity. Banks and other fintechs have\nbeen more active in the market, however we remain agile and responsive to these changes, protecting our base\nand continue to grow.\nSlide 13: Merchant revenue drivers FY25 Q1 | Card acceptance\nCard enabled devices grew 15% year-on-year to over 53 450 devices. Having switched on a large portion of our\nback book of Kazang devices for card acceptance during FY 2023 and FY 2024, this is a factor of new to platform\nmerchants as opposed to backfilling the existing VAS base.\nThroughput grew 18% to R4.2 billion for the quarter and is reflective of the opportunity going forward. We are\nalso continuing our focus on higher ARPUs per device, with many poorer performing sites being uplifted and\ndeployed into higher turnover, more profitable merchants. We do see a significant opportunity in the tavern\nspace as we bring the Touchsides sites onto our Kazang Pay service and further penetrate this vertical. As\nmentioned earlier, we are seeing good results in switching Touchsides taverns onto our platform.\n6\nFor our card business, the introduction of the Adumo business brings exciting opportunities with the scale and\nsolution sets that this brings to our platform.\nSlide 14: Merchant revenue drivers FY24 Q4 | Cash management solutions\nOur cash offering is an important part of the ecosystem that we are building in formal and informal markets. Our\nvaulting solution brings significant efficiency gains to informal merchants as they don’t have to travel to banks to\ndeposit cash – they can go to their closest merchant in the community with a Kazang vault and drop their cash.\nThis is immediately available in their wallet for working capital, supplier payments or VAS purchases. We believe\nwe make a real difference in our micro merchants’ operations as we build Kazang merchant communities,\nenhance risk management and facilitate immediate cash availability.\nCash vaults in the field grew 2% y-o-y driven by stronger growth in Kazang Vaults, in the informal market, offset\nby muted growth and upliftments due to bankruptcies in the formal small-to-medium merchant market, which\ncontinues to experience challenging conditions.\nThroughput increased 4% year-on-year driven by Kazang Vaults in the informal market, which saw cash\nsettlements doubling and now contributes approximately 10% of our cash settlements, compared to 5% a year\nago.\nSlide 15: Merchant revenue drivers FY24 Q4 | Lending\nOur credit business is primarily exposed to the formal small-and-medium merchant sector. As our merchants\nfaced economic headwinds, their credit scores have suffered leading to many not meeting our credit criteria in\nrespect of relends. This has resulted in lower advances and book size; however, this has maintained the quality\nof our book.\nWith the commencement of a down cycle in interest rates and a more positive economic outlook, we have\nexperienced an increased in lending activity. Disbursements in Q1 were R166 million with our loan book at R273\nmillion. This represents an 8% increase in disbursements over the previous quarter.\nAs a reminder, last year we suspended KazangPay Advance, which focused on micro-merchants. We are currently\nin the pilot phase of a re-launch which we will hopefully be in a position to start commercial roll-out in the second\nhalf of the year.\nWith new lending products in the formal and informal markets, and the cross-sell opportunities into the acquired\nmerchant base that Adumo and GAAP present, supported by an improving interest rate environment, we\nanticipate an enhanced lending performance in FY 2025.\n7\nSlide 16: Merchant revenue drivers | Enterprise\nOur enterprise market solution is strategically important to us and completes our merchant offering. Our nascent\nEnterprise business brings an opportunity to leverage larger corporate customer relationships across our\nbroader, consumer and merchant, ecosystem. We continue to invest in and enhance our technology and believe\nthis will be an important contributor in future years. The new operating model with Enterprise as a distinct pillar\nwill increase our focus and improve performance of this business.\nWe have a network of over 620 integrated billers, and are one of the largest in the country, enabling enterprise\nclients to offer value-added service to their customers.\nWe have seen a strengthening in our position in the formal VAS distribution market, with healthy growth in\nthroughput, led by prepaid electricity purchases increasing by 36% year-on-year, and bill payments up 18%.\nOur PRISM solution is one of only a few providers of proprietary security technologies, and opens a revenue\nopportunity with finance, retail, telecom, and utility clients. This presents a meaningful growth opportunity\nwhich we are looking to further invest in over the coming quarters.\nSlide 17: Merchant performance Q1 FY25\nTurning to the financials, our revenue for the quarter was flat year-on-year. As Ali mentioned, the sales mix\nbetween PIN and PIN-less airtime impacts our gross revenue growth rate. This change in mix is now captured in\nour net revenue metric. On a net revenue basis we delivered a 9% year-on-year growth.\nAt the adjusted EBITDA level, after normalizing for NUETS (now rebranded to PRISM POS), we recorded a 1%\nincrease to R142 million for the quarter. We have not presented normalized figures for two additional line items\nwhich are meaningful but intermittent. These include the bulk VAS opportunities which impact our results from\ntime to time, in addition, this year we changed allocations of South African support costs. Normalizing for these\nitems would result in a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Q1 2025 performance reflects a scenario in which we have further invested, organically and inorganically, in\nthe construction of our platform. This has resulted in increased expenditure this quarter compared to a year ago.\nIn addition to this, when comparing the two relevant quarters, the sales mix in this quarter is skewed toward\nlower margin products, contributing to a result that is not reflective of our forward looking Merchant Division\nperformance.\nTo slide 18\n8\nAs mentioned at the outset, we see a significant opportunity in the segments we serve, supported by the secular\ntrends of digitalization and the resultant market share shift from banks to non-bank providers.\nSlide 18 - Evolution of our Merchant Division’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe merchant division has evolved and reflects a very different construct today than when compared to our point\nof departure. We are excited to continue on this trajectory.\nIn micro-merchant we are entering our busiest quarter with South Africa’s festive season upon us. In the\nmerchant pillar we have commenced the Adumo and GAAP integration and are encouraged by engagements\namongst our management and sales teams to date. As mentioned, there are new initiatives in the pipeline in our\nEnterprise pillar.\nIn closing we are proving a view of the Merchant Division outlook for FY 2025. We expect Segment Adjusted\nEBITDA between R725 million and R745 million, which at the mid-point represents a 23% growth for the year.\nAs Ali addressed in his introduction, we are building the leading fintech platform in Southern Africa, with a broad\nsolution set and significant scale opportunities in a market which is ripe for innovation and disruption.\nThank you, Lincoln will take you through the consumer results and outlook.\nSlide 19: Consumer Division\nThank you Steve.\nIt has been another successful quarter for the Consumer business, as well as a busy one. As we prepare for the\nrest of FY 2025, we have already launched a new front-end platform to improve our sales capabilities and\napproved, an enhanced lending product, currently under consideration, to be launched in quarter two. We\nwelcomed Adumo Payouts and its team to the consumer team from 1 October 2024.\nSlide 20 : South Africa remains underpenetrated with huge addressable opportunities.\nAs a reminder, our consumer business operates in the lower LSM segments in South Africa which is estimated to\nbe approximately 26 million consumers. Within that our core focus is on the grant beneficiary market of\napproximately 12 million monthly grant recipients, where we estimate our market share to be approximately\n11% of this market.\n9\nSome examples of the pain points for grant beneficiaries include lower smartphone penetration and expensive\ndata preventing easy use of digital channels, expensive and opaque pricing structures, limited access to financial\nservices and long waits at traditional branch networks. We have invested heavily in understanding these pain\npoints of our clients and are continually designing and adjusting our products and distribution to align with their\nneeds.\nSlide 21 : Consumer | Offering straight forward and cost-effective Financial Services\nFor these consumers we provide a suite of financial services to help them access their money, make payments,\nbuy essential services, get credit and protect their families. We service our existing base and attract new\nconsumers through a national network of 220 branches, 450 ATMs, over 600 sales and service consultants and\nover 100 sales and service flexi consultants. Our USSD and voice branch options are becoming very popular\nchoices for our consumers which I will talk to shortly.\nLooking at our KPIs, we have grown our EPE customer base by 14% over the past year to over 1.5 million, of\nwhich 1.3 million, or 88%, are permanent grant beneficiaries. These are customers we are able to cross-sell our\nlending and insurance products to and where we place our focus on.\n(To next slide) – slide 22\nSlide 22: Growth in EPE base | Continued momentum in cross selling & upselling initiatives\nOur EPE account base continues to grow at the new, step change levels, post our marketing and distribution\nnetwork improvements last year. We had 62,000 gross new account activations in Q1 which was pleasing in a\ntraditionally quiet quarter for us. The “higher than usual” level of activations in quarter one last year (76, 000\ngross activations) was as a result of the Post Bank liquidation rumours and significant issues encountered in the\nPost Bank’s grant distribution system. This led to a large migration of customers away from the Post Bank, of\nwhich we were one of the beneficiaries. Net activations were 26,000 for this quarter.\nWe are very pleased with the progress we are making on our cross-sell initiatives. We expect this to continue\nwith the introduction of our sales front-end and the improved lending product. We saw a greater than 20% YoY\nincrease in bank account customers who also take a loan with us, and a more than 30% increase in bank account\ncustomers that also have an insurance policy with us. EPE banking customers who have both, a loan, and an\ninsurance policy with us increased more than 35% year-on-year.\n(Back to KPI slide ) – slide 21\n10\nOur gross lending book increased 34% year-on-year to R564 million. We advanced R451 million during the\nquarter up 28% year-on-year. Our penetration rate is just over 40%, whilst our loan loss ratio has remained\nconstant at approximately 6% per year.\nWe currently have 466 000 active insurance policies, a 30% increase on last year. Our penetration rate increased\nfrom 30% a year ago to 34% in FY25 quarter one. As with the micro-loans, our insurance product has a big impact\non our customers lives, providing cover of up to R50 000 on the death of a beneficiary. We are maintaining our\nefficient payouts rates in terms of time taken to affect insurance claim payouts. 90% of claims were paid out\nwithin 24 hours, and 95% within 48 hours.\nThe value our customers place on these policies is reflected in our very high premium collection ratio of 96%,\nwhich is very good at this end of the market, where it is normally around 60%. Further, our lapse ratio of\napproximately 7% is significantly better than industry norm of over 20% in this market.\nThe tailored product set for grant beneficiaries, combined with our service levels and distribution has led to the\nfurther improvement in our cross-selling abilities as demonstrated earlier, resulting in our ARPU increasing to\nR91 per month from R83 a year ago.\nSlide 23: Repositioned EasyPay Everywhere brand and USSD channel continues to grow\nAs mentioned, we now have over 220 branches conveniently located for grant beneficiaries and are opening a\nfurther 15 this year, supported by over 450 ATMs.\nIn addition to enhancing our branch network, we continue to invest in our USSD and voice branch platforms. Our\nUSSD channel is performing better than we had hoped, evident on the graphs on this slide. Both the “usage” and\n“number of unique contact numbers” utilising our USSD channels have increased significantly from January 2023\nto September 2024. Our customers are using the USSD channels for VAS purchases including airtime, electricity\nand DSTV as well as for EPE loan applications. We received more than 60 000 loan applications through USSD in\nQ1, a 62% increase compared to a year ago. Our EPE customers no longer need to leave their homes and can\nreceive money in their accounts in less than five minutes. When applying for loans in person, transport and\nrelated expenses might easily exceed R100, which is a significant sum given the loan values at this point. This\ndemonstrates our belief that fintech innovation has the potential to significantly impact people's lives.\nSlide 24: EPE Growth strategy yielding encouraging results\nThe financial results for Q1 were again very pleasing, demonstrating the effect of the strategy and hard work our\nteams have put in over the past 3 years.\n11\nRevenue increased 30% YoY to R378 million. Segment adjusted EBITDA was R79 million which is an increase of\n99% over last year. It is important to note that the like-for-like growth rate would have been higher given our\nConsumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA in FY25 Q1 includes a R15m interest expense charge compared to zero in\nprior periods. Prior to 2025 the interest expense related to funding the Consumer Lending book, was included in\nthe Group’s interest expense charge. The reason for this change is because we are currently engaging our funders\nto provide the Consumer Division with a specific debt facility to be utilized to fund our Consumer lending book,\nwhich results in the interest expense charge being accounted for as a “cost of sales” item which is within Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA.\nI am extremely proud of the team, we continue to deliver against our strategic focus areas, including enhancing\nproduct and service delivery, and, cross selling and upselling. We continue to make strides in launching new\nproducts and systems, all of which enhance our offering to our consumers.\nSlide 25: Looking forward\nOn the product front our VAS sales to our account base is being well received and I am also very excited by the\nlaunch of Bonngwe last month. This is our new sales front-end we have been developing. It provides our sales\nand service consultants with a more detailed 360 degree view of each of our customers. They will be much better\nequipped to efficiently service our client base, cross-sell our loan, insurance and VAS products as well as attract\nnew EPE customers to our platform.\nDriven by our purpose to provide financial services and software to Southern Africa’s underserviced consumers,\nimproving people’s lives and increasing financial inclusion, we continue to enhance our product offering to\nconsumers based on their needs, and at the same deliver on our strategy.\nIn our insurance business, research showed that EPE clients with other family members, such as parents and\nsiblings, were dependent on the financial support of our clients. Often, our clients would be responsible for\npaying for a funeral policy of such family members.\nIn order to address this, EasyPay Insurance, launched a benefit where existing policyholders and new clients\ncould elect to cover up to 6 of their dependent family members with cover ranging from R5 000 to R30 000. Since\nthe launch of this benefit in April 2024, more than 25 000 clients have elected to cover their dependent family\nmembers, with cover exceeding R650 million.\nSimilarly, in our lending business, we have conducted extensive research into our customers’ financial services\nneeds. We are looking to launch a loan product for qualifying consumers where the maximum loan and\nrepayment term increases from “R2000 and six months” to “R4000 and nine months”. The research we\ncommissioned showed that many of our customers were resorting to additional loans often on significantly\n12\nworse terms, and often from unregistered lenders. Our decision was also supported by the consistent, and low,\nloan loss ratio we have experienced in our book over the past two years. We will be applying the same\naffordability criteria to the new product and expect our average loan size to increase from R1580 to R2600 over\ntime.\nBack to slide 24 (where we have strategic objective focus areas listed)\nAs I have outlined before and in more detail at our full year results that we presented in September, we are not\ngetting complacent because of the momentum we have achieved. We believe that we have a very large\nopportunity to grow our EPE base and we are hard at work continually, and enhancing our products, service and\ndistribution to deliver the optimal customer experience in the most convenient manner to our existing and future\ngrant beneficiary customers.\nSlide 26 - Evolution of our Consumer Division’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nOn 1 October the Adumo Payouts business officially became part of the Consumer Division. We are looking\nforward to working with them as we build out the Consumer offering beyond the grant beneficiary space. The\nAdumo Payouts contribution will be reflected in the Q2 results as it now forms part of the division for the full\nperiod.\nI will end with an overview on our guidance for the consumer division for FY 2025. We expect the Consumer\nDivision to deliver between R325 million and R345 million in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for FY 2025. This would\nbe higher if one excludes the impact of the estimated R80 million interest expense charge, now included in\nConsumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA in FY 2025 compared to zero in FY 2024. We expect the Consumer Division\nto continue the strong profitability growth.\nWith that I would like to hand over to Dan.\nDan Smith\nSlide 27: Financial highlights\nThank you, Lincoln. Good day everyone.\nI am delighted to be joining as CFO at this exciting stage of Lesaka’s evolution. I have deep experience in M&A,\ncapital markets and capital allocation and look forward to playing a key role in Lesaka’s development as we add\nfurther scale and solutions to our platform. I have been fortunate to be closely involved with the Lesaka team\n13\nover the past 3 years in establishing Lesaka as the leading independent fintech in Southern Africa. I will be\nworking closely with our board, investors, funders and business leaders to ensure that Lesaka is optimally\npositioned to deliver on our organic and inorganic opportunities, whilst adhering to optimal capital allocation\nprinciples and a focus on shareholder value creation.\nAs a reminder, Lesaka is a domestic filer in the United States, we report results in U.S. dollars, under US GAAP.\nHowever, our operational currency is South African Rand and as such we analyse our performance in South\nAfrican Rand.\nSlide 28: Group Revenue & EBITDA for Q1 FY25 Consistent execution\nAt a group level our revenue was at the mid-point of our guidance provided, increasing 3%, to R2.6 billion, year-\non-year. On a Net Revenue basis we grew our top line by 16% year-on-year.\nTo recap what Ali mentioned earlier, Net Revenue is calculated as GAAP Revenue less the cost of pre-paid airtime\nsold and commissions paid to third parties selling our VAS products. This measure will eliminate fluctuations in\nRevenue primarily due to the mix in pinned versus pinless airtime sales and provides a better representation of\nour topline growth.\nConsumer continued delivering impressive growth with revenue increasing 30% year-on-year to R378 million.\nWith the high repeat customer rate in our loan book and collection rate in our insurance book, our Consumer\nDivision provides a sticky annuity base with high levels of predictability. As we add further EPE consumer\naccounts each month, increase cross-sell, and add further products we anticipate continued good growth in this\nsegment.\nIn our Merchant Division, we were impacted by the mix of pinned versus pinless sales of airtime when compared\nto a year ago. However on a net revenue basis we grew our top line by 9% year-on-year.\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA grew by 12% to R168 million against guidance of R160 million to R180 million. This was\nthe nineth consecutive quarter of meeting earnings guidance.\nConsumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA almost doubled compared to last year as we added scale to our EPE\naccount base and increased penetration of our lending and insurance products. Merchant Segment Adjusted\nEBITDA was marginally lower for the quarter, decreasing 1% to R142 million. As Steve mentioned in his merchant\noverview, this was due to a change in our revenue mix, an increased competitive environment and higher\ninvestment, at an operating expense level (mainly the IT platform), in our platform. Adjusting for these items,\ngrowth would be 10% over last year, which is more reflective of this division’s underlying performance.\n14\nGroup costs increased to R53 million for the quarter due to a combination of new hires at a group level and\nincremental operating costs both of which relate to scaling our platform.\nSlide 29 : GAAP Income Statement for the quarter (FY25 Q1, FY24 Q1, FY23 Q1)\nSlide 30 – we do not show this slide\nOperating income for the quarter decreased by R4.5 million to a loss of R0.3 million.\nShow slide 31\nSlide 31: Operating profit (loss)\nHowever, included in this is R30 million of one-off costs related to the Adumo acquisition, without which we\nwould have shown healthy growth at an operating income level to R29.7 million, on a like-for-like basis.\nBack to slide 29\nOur interest expense remained fairly constant compared to last year. We are looking to reduce this significant\nexpense and are in the process of optimising our current funding arrangements with our banking partners.\nSlide 32: Fundamental and basic EPS\nTurning to our per share performance, we believe that fundamental earnings per share is the most appropriate\nmeasure of our performance. It adjusts for once-off items, such as transaction costs, and excludes the\namortization of intangibles which is a non-cash charge, and stock-based compensation charges.\nOur fundamental earnings for the quarter improved from a loss of R5 million last year to a profit of R43 million.\nOn a per share basis this translates to a 74 cents improvement, to 66 cents, from a loss of 8 cents a year ago (FY\n2024 Q1).\nOur GAAP basic loss per share improved 40 cents, or 24%, to R1.26 for the quarter.\nSlide 33 : Focus on reducing debt & growing Group Adjusted EBITDA\n15\nTurning to our cash flow.\nOur cash generated from business operations, which is operating cash flow before interest paid, tax paid,\nworking capital related items and movement in loan book funding, increased to R196 million, compared to R184\nmillion a year ago, and was slightly lower than R211 million, in the previous quarter.\nOur interest paid was lower than the previous quarter, as we took advantage of the opportunity to capitalise a\nportion of interest on our facilities as we optimise these funding arrangements.\nOur net cash generated from operations after loan book funding and before capex, is typically a good reflection\nof our conversion of EBITDA to cash.\nHowever, in this quarter there was a significant working capital outflow related predominantly to 2 items:\n(i) Firstly the payment of annual staff bonuses, and\n(ii) Secondly the unwind, during the quarter, of amounts payable to third parties that we provide VAS and\nbill payment services to. The previous quarter end (FY 2024 Q4) fell on a weekend, resulting in\nsignificantly higher than usual cash and payables balances, which were then settled on the first\nbusiness day of the current quarter (FY 2025 Q1), leading to the large cash outflow. This is simply a\ntiming difference.\nWe utilised a net R28 million to grow our loan books in the quarter, which overall resulted in net cash used in\noperating activities of R73 million.\nWe spent R70 million on capex resulting in net cash utilised of R143 million for the quarter.\nCash generation, cash conversion and optimal capital allocation will be a key priority of mine going forward.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, our net debt to Group Adjusted EBITDA (Last-twelve months actual) ratio is\n2.6 times at the end of this quarter (Q1 FY 2025) compared to 3.8 times a year ago. This is slightly higher than at\nyear-end, 30 June 2024 at, 2.5 times, primarily due to the lower cash balances in our net debt calculation.\nWe have previously communicated to the market that we are looking to continue reducing our Net Debt to\nGroup Adjusted EBITDA ratio, with a medium-term objective of a 2x ratio, which we believe is comfortably\nserviceable and the appropriate capital structure for the business.\nWe have R1.3 billion of non-core assets on our balance sheet. The major non-core asset is our holding in\nMobikwik and the valuation on balance sheet remains unchanged at USD $76.3m (translated at closing exchange\n16\nrate of R17.18 to USD). Mobikwik continues to improve its financial performance and still plans to list on the\nIndian stock exchange as soon as practical. We remain committed to realizing the value from this asset through\nan orderly disposal process in due course.\nSlide 34 : Capex\nCapital expenditure for the quarter amounted to R70 million, with R41 million relating to growth capex, primarily\nin the Merchant Division for Kazang devices and cash vaults. Both of which deliver strong IRRs and will support\nour growth over the medium term. We also made investments in our technology infrastructure.\nSlide 37 : Guidance / Outlook\nTurning to our outlook and guidance, we reaffirm our FY 25 Revenue guidance at R10 billion to R11 billion and\nFY 25 Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance of R900 million to R1 billion.\nWe are also introducing an additional measure being Net Revenue, which will provide an improved view of our\ntop line performance on a comparative basis.\nOur Net Revenue guidance is R5.2 billion to R5.6 billion for FY25, which implies 35% year-on year growth at the\nmidpoint of this range. Our Group Adjusted EBITDA guidance for FY25 implies 37% growth, year-on-year, at the\nmidpoint of this range.\nExcluding the impact of Adumo, and the allocation of interest expense charges directly related to the consumer\nloan book in our FY25 Group Adjusted EBITDA, the mid-point implies a growth rate of more than 30% on a like-\nfor-like basis.\nFor our second quarter ending December 31 2024, we expect Revenue between R2.4 billion and R2.6 billion,\nand Net Revenue of between R1.2 billion and R1.4 billion. Group Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be between\nR190 million and R210 million for the quarter. These figures are inclusive of Adumo from October 1, 2024.\nBack to slide 38\nIn terms of the composition of our FY25 Group Adjusted EBITDA, this view reconciles back to the Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA contributions per division that Steve and Lincoln presented earlier. We expect that the\nMerchant Division and Consumer Division will contribute approximately 70% and 30% respectively to Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA, with Group costs at approximately 20% of Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\n17\nFinally, as you can see from the growth trend in our Group Adjusted EBITDA, we have made great progress in\nthe past few years since we started this journey.\nWe have added and will continue to add scale and proprietary solutions to our platform, enhancing our ability\nto innovate and disrupt as we entrench ourselves as Southern Africa’s leading independent fintech.\nQuestions slide\nWith that I would like to close the presentation and address questions you may have for management through\na results Q&A with the executive management team led by Ali Mazandarani, Executive Chairman of Lesaka.\nPlease raise your hands or post in the question chat box as we proceed with this live Q&A. Thank you.\nQ&A Session with Management\nQuestion: Raj Sharma – B.Reily Securities\nAli, can you unpack what you talk about as “the huge pool of profits in the payments space currently sitting with\nthe banks and waiting for disruption”. How quickly will this materialize for fintechs in SA based on your\nexperience and research?\nAnswer: Ali Mazanderani – Executive Chairman:\nThank you, Bronwyn, and thank you, Raj, for the question. Firstly, just to reiterate, our biggest competitor is really\ninefficiency. We strive to reduce the cost of the services we provide and we strive to provide a suite of services\nthat give our customers the offering that they deserve and that is the principal axis of energy. However, there is\na large existing profit pool in the banking space and to give you a sense and provide some sort of like referencing\nof what that could look like. This is specific to the merchant acquiring business and ancillary services, so it doesn't\nrepresent the entirety of our TAM. But in the merchant acquiring space, the total process volume at retail of the\nbig five South African banks is close to $100 billion today. And it's fair to assume a net margin for merchant\nacquiring and ancillary services of about 100 basis points is generally an industry reference, although it obviously\ndiffers by segments and by this nature of the offering. That would represent about a billion dollars of annual\ncontribution. You obviously would expect there to be growth in that base through the digitization over the\ncoming years and I would expect that growth to be double digit given that cash is still a dominant medium of\nexchange in the economy. In terms of how South Africa will evolve from a bank versus non-bank environment in\nthat respect, I don't see any reason why it should follow a different trajectory than the trajectory that the UK,\nEurope or Brazil followed over the last decade and the coming decade. Those trajectories have been consistent.\nThe non-bank and fintech disruptors have typically taken between a third and half of the market over the last\ndecade with varying degrees of speed in different markets. So, I think we can expect a similar outcome.\n18\nQuestion: Raj Sharma – B.Reily Securities\nIn the merchant division, organic growth is slower than expected. Especially compared to the 20% plus growth\nrates that Connect was growing at when acquired. How should we be thinking about the merchant business\ngrowth rates on an organic basis? What would it be for FY25 excluding Adumo?\nAnswer: Ali Mazanderani – Executive Chairman & Steven Heilbron – Head of Corporate Development:\nAli: Thanks, Raj, for the question. I just want to start by answering the a few points from a group perspective,\nand then I'll ask Stephen to give some specificity in the merchant segment. So firstly, I don't think that it's softer\nthan expected. We achieved the midpoint of our guidance and I would just like to reiterate, we have achieved\nthe midpoint of our guidance, not just this quarter, but for the last nine consecutive quarters. I think we've\ndemonstrated that we deliver on what we say. In that respect, I think it was fully expected that that would be\nthe outcome for the quarter. In terms of organic versus inorganic growth at a group level, we achieved EBITDA\nof R 691 million rand in FY24. Our guidance indicated 30% year-on-year organic growth on a like-for-like basis. If\nyou take R 691 million and you apply a 30% growth rate on it, you'll get to about R 900 million. Our guidance also\nindicated that the interest charge in the consumer lending business is included, that was not included in the prior\nyears which we expect to equate to about R 80 million. So R 900 million minus R 80 million gives you R 820\nmillion. And that's basically a 30% organic like-for-like growth rate for Lesaka for this year with a common base.\nGiven that our guidance is between R 900 million round and a R 1 billion, I think from that you can infer Adumo’s\ncontribution given the fact that it will be consolidated for three quarters of the year.\nSteven: Thanks, Bronwyn and Ali. I think if I take you back to our point of departure, we've been very clear right\nfrom the outset that we were going to construct a dynamic fintech platform that focused on merchants, micro\nmerchants and enterprises, and that that construct was going to be a function of both organic growth and\ninorganic activity. And I think as a starter, I think if you look back at our track record, we have delivered in respect\nof the organic growth and more recently, I think as well from an inorganic perspective, we have delivered all that\nwe set out to do. Having said that, if we look at the current quarter, we had a lot going on in this quarter. We\ngrew our net revenues by 9%. We had strong throughputs, but I don't believe that this quarter when we compare\nit to Q1 2024 is a proxy for growth. We've given clear guidance to FY25 June. We expect at the midpoint to hit\n23% growth for the merchant division. That's in line with our historic performance. I don't think that that is slow.\nI think it could possibly be better. And in the construct, what I would also be saying, you know, this is a period\nthrough which we are building the platform. And our focus is very much now around disruption, but specifically\nto creating bundled product. We've now deepened our merchant segments and broadened our product sets,\nand we're putting a very strong focus into unit economics, bundling and taking a broader offering to our clientele.\nAnd so, I think the guidance that we've given is really the proxy for growth and that puts the context around Q1\n24 to Q1 25.\n19\nQuestion: Theo O’Neill – LHR Research:\nThe consumer segment had an excellent performance, congratulations to the team. You mention the launch of\nnew products, what is in the pipeline and can you cover the rationale and findings from your research behind\nconsidering increasing loan size and term?\nAnswer: Lincoln Mali – CEO Southern Africa\nOne of the things that we've made reference to is ongoing research and thinking about what's best for our clients.\nSo, one of the things we found in our research was that our clients were demanding more credit than we could\noffer. Our limit was R 2,000 over six months. And what was becoming clear was that our clients were demanding\nto get more of that credit. And what also disturbed me was that our clients were going to unscrupulous lenders\nto get more credit than what we could offer them. So, we started thinking about what we could do to tweak our\ncurrent product to meet some of the needs of our clients within the National Credit Act and in an environment\nwhere our clients can afford. So, what we are working on now is launch a product where we would move from\nthe R 2,000 limit. And six months limit to a possible maximum limit of R 4,000 to a client and a nine month term.\nAnd we think that on average we'll be able to have loan sizes that will increase maybe to R 2,600. And so that is\nwhat we are experimenting with. The second thing I'd like to maybe point to in our thinking about what we want\nto do going forward is that we now have the Adumo team that is joining us, Steve Mallaby and his team, and\nthey have 250,000 customers that are in that Adumo Payout business. What we're starting to do is to see what\nproducts would make sense to that customer base. Firstly, the most important thing is that this is our first\nbridgehead into a consumer base that is not grant beneficiaries. And this is an important thing for us as we evolve\nour platform. So we are thinking of doing a number of things in that space. Firstly. is to see whether we can layer\na VAS product into that customer base. Secondly, we're starting to think about a funeral product in that base,\nand we'll start to think about later on a lending product in that base. This allows us to think of our customer base\nbeyond the traditional base that we've had of grant beneficiaries and these are some of the things that we've\ngot in our pipeline.\nQuestion: Sven Thorsden – Anchor Securities\nYou mention opportunities in the Enterprise business providing opportunity to leverage larger corporate\ncustomer relationships across our broader, consumer and merchant, ecosystem. Can you give us a practical\nexample of this and explain some of the opportunities driving growth sentiment in this pillar?\nAnswer: Naeem Kola – Group Chief Operating Officer\nOur enterprise division, as we noted, evolved as a need to develop solutions and process transactions on behalf\nof ourselves. As a natural evolution, we're trying to move this function away from being a pure cost center, but\nbeing a profit center as well. And we're going to do this through building solutions for both internally as well as\nour external clients. I think very practical solutions in relation to this is that we provide VAS and bill payment\nservices today to our merchants. We're going to expand this to a broader customer base, which are third parties\n20\nas well as corporate customers. We also do tokenization internally for security purposes, and we see a big need\nfor this within the telcos as well as municipalities and third-party clients. So these are practical examples of where\nwe think we can drive revenues within this enterprise division on the broader spectrum as an organization.\nQuestion: Jarred Houston – All Weather Capital\nQuite a few questions on the numbers from me please. Please spend some time unpacking the increase in group\ncosts and is this the quarterly run rate going forward? Secondly, what is included in once-off items in the appendix\ntransaction costs, and explain the large working capital outflow. I will reiterate if we start, please with the\nunpacking of the increase in group costs. Thank you.\nAnswer – Dan Smith – Group Chief Financial Officer\nJarred, our group costs increased 253 million for the quarter. This was a combination of new hires at a group\nlevel as well as the costs of scaling our platform. We bore these costs at a group level rather than push them\ndown into the underlying divisions. To give you some color around the nature of these costs, the staff costs, the\ncosts relating to managing our compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley director's fees, legal fees, and of course our\ngroup in US listed audit fees. There's some more disclosure around those in the 10-Q. In terms of our guidance,\nwe expect our Group Costs to be approximately 20% of our total segment adjusted EBITDA. In other words,\nroughly R 200 million for the year. So, the run rate we're currently incurring is roughly a good approximation of\nwhat one could expect for the full year ahead.\nIn once-off items, two categories, R 30 million, relate to the costs being incurred in the Adumo transaction\nassociated to due diligence costs, M&A and legal fees. There's also a separate category of approximately R 1.8\nmillion of costs, and those relate to some of the smaller M&A deals we did in the quarter in the period. So\nTouchsides, our ESOP plan, as well as a couple of other smaller transactions.\nAnd the large working capital outflow. Net cash generated from operations of the loan book funding, and before\ncapex is typically a good reflection of a conversion of EBITDA to cash. In this quarter, though, we did have a very\nsignificant outflow of approximately R 193 million. It is really simplified into two categories. One is the payment\nof our annual staff bonuses, those who got paid in September of this year. Obviously, this does not come through\nin prior quarters. And the second is the unwind during the quarter of our months payable to third parties that\nwe provide VAS and bill payment services to. So, in the previous quarter, it was the one ending June of this year\nwhich fell on a weekend and resulted in us holding significantly higher than usual cash and payables balances.\nThese were settled on the following business day, which fell into the current quarter leading to the large cash\noutflow. So this is really just simply a timing difference.\n21\nQuestion: Theo O’Neill – LHR Research:\nCan you provide an update on your M&A strategy? You alluded to further bolt-on and transformative M&A. Is\nthis slowly focused on South Africa or also on the rest of Africa? And how do you see yourself funding large\nacquisitions? Will it be mainly debt and shares or will you be asking for capital from shareholders?\nAnswer: Ali Mazanderani – Executive Chairman\nWe see M&A as another lever of growth to our organic growth story. And we see a material opportunity to scale\nthe business. Indeed, many of the most successful fintechs on the continent have utilized M&A effectively in the\nfintech and payment space and I think this has been a very effective lever in aggregate. We were specific about\nsaying we'll be disciplined in the process. We will only engage in material transactions that are going to be\naccretive. I think in terms of geographical focus area. I mean, our principal market is South Africa, but we are in\na number of neighboring geographies. The Adumo transaction has increased our presence in several\ngeographies. And so, businesses that are operating in neighboring geographies would very much also be part of\nthe ambit of opportunity. In terms of how we would fund that, I think we are flexible depending on the\nparticularities of that transaction. I think debt and capital from shareholders are all legitimate options. What I\nwould say is that we've given a sense of where we want to be managing our debt and we haven't got any change\nassociated with that. But I am excited about what we can build by continuing to augment our offering and we\nhave four subsectors, each of which has attractive opportunities available in them that can increase and improve\nour offering and also expand our TAM which we can drive synergies from. I would also just finally say that I think\nthis is a business that has demonstrated effectively its capacity to execute and to integrate and we hope to be\nable to continue that.\nBronwyn Nielsen\nThat's all we have time for today. Thank you very much for joining us for Lesaka's first quarter live Q&A.\nFY25, and if you do have any further questions, please direct them to Investor Relations at Lesaka.
