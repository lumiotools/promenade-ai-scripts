BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nHome BancShares, Inc. (“Home BancShares”) which may also be referred to in this document as “we,” “us,” “HBI” or the “Company”) is a Conway, Arkansas\nheadquartered bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company’s common stock is traded through the New\nYork Stock Exchange under the symbol “HOMB.” We are primarily engaged in providing a broad range of commercial and retail banking and related financial\nservices to businesses, real estate developers and investors, individuals and municipalities through our wholly owned community bank subsidiary – Centennial\nBank. Centennial Bank has branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, South Alabama and New York City. Although the Company has a diversified loan\nportfolio, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, commercial real estate loans represented 56.7% and 56.3% of gross loans and 215.5% and 230.1% of total stockholders’\nequity, respectively. The Company’s total assets, total deposits, total revenue and net income for each of the past three years are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nTotal assets $ 22,656,658 $ 22,883,588 $ 18,052,138\nTotal deposits 16,787,711 17,938,783 14,260,570\nTotal revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income) 996,879 933,787 710,540\nNet income 392,929 305,262 319,021\nHome BancShares acquires, organizes and invests in community banks that serve attractive markets. Our community banking team is built around experienced\nbankers with strong local relationships. The Company was formed in 1998 by an investor group led by John W. Allison, our Chairman, and Robert H. “Bunny”\nAdcock, Jr., one of our directors. Since opening our first subsidiary bank in 1999, we have acquired and integrated a total of 23 banks with locations in Arkansas,\nFlorida, Texas and Alabama, including 18 banks since 2010, seven of which we acquired through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) assisted\ntransactions. Our subsidiary bank has operated under a single charter and the Centennial Bank name since 2009. In 2015, after acquiring a pool of national\ncommercial real estate loans, we created Centennial Commercial Finance Group (“Centennial CFG”) to build out a national lending platform focused on\ncommercial real estate as well as commercial and industrial loans. Centennial CFG operates out of our New York City branch office and loan production offices in\nLos Angeles, California, Dallas, Texas and Miami, Florida. In 2018, we acquired Shore Premier Finance (“SPF”), a marine-lending division of Union Bank & Trust\nof Richmond, Virginia, and established the SPF division of Centennial Bank to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans. In\n2020, we acquired LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People’s United Bank, N.A. of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and consolidated LH-Finance and its loan\nportfolio with our SPF division. The SPF division operates out of loan production offices in Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. In 2022, we completed\nour largest acquisition to-date and first in the state of Texas with the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc. and its bank subsidiary, Happy State Bank,\nheadquartered in Amarillo, Texas, on April 1, 2022.\nAcquisitions\nWe believe many individuals and businesses prefer banking with a locally managed community bank capable of providing flexibility and quick decisions. The\nexecution of our community banking strategy has allowed us to rapidly build our network of banking operations through acquisitions. The following summary\nprovides additional details concerning our acquisitions during the previous five fiscal years.\nLH-Finance – On February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People’s United Bank, N.A., for a\ncash purchase price of approximately $421.2 million. Like SPF, LH-Finance provides direct consumer financing for United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\")\nregistered high-end sail and power boats, as well as inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, LH-Finance had approximately $409.1 million in total assets, including $407.4\nmillion in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $14.6 million being recorded.\nThe acquired portfolio of loans is housed in our SPF division. The SPF division is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new\nloan production. In connection with this acquisition, we opened a new loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland.\n5\nTable of Contents\nLendingClub Bank Marine Portfolio – On February 4, 2022, the Company completed the purchase of the performing marine loan portfolio of Utah-based\nLendingClub Bank (“LendingClub”). Under the terms of the purchase agreement with LendingClub, the Company acquired approximately $242.2 million of yacht\nloans. This portfolio of loans is housed within the Company's SPF division, which is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan\nproduction.\nHappy Bancshares, Inc. – On April 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc. (“Happy”), and merged Happy State Bank into\nCentennial Bank. The Company issued approximately 42.4 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately $958.8 million as of April 1, 2022. In\naddition, the holders of certain Happy stock-based awards received approximately $3.7 million in cash in cancellation of such awards, for a total transaction value\nof approximately $962.5 million.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, Happy had approximately $6.69 billion in total assets, $3.65 billion in loans and\n$5.86 billion in customer deposits. Happy formerly operated its banking business from 62 locations in Texas.\nFor an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of LendingClub's Marine Portfolio, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Carter, III 48 Executive Officer Regional President\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur goals are to achieve growth in earnings per share and to create and build stockholder value. Our growth strategy entails the following:\n• Strategic acquisitions – Strategic acquisitions (both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted) have been a significant component of our historical growth\nstrategy, and we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can continue to be a large part of our growth strategy. We completed the acquisition of Happy\nBancshares, Inc. headquartered in Amarillo, Texas, during the second quarter of 2022. Our principal acquisition focus in the near term will be to continue\nto expand our presence in Texas, Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets, although we may seek to expand into other areas if\nattractive financial opportunities in other market areas arise. We will continue to evaluate potential bank acquisition opportunities to determine whether\nthey are in the best interests of our Company. Our goals in making these decisions are to maximize the return to our shareholders and to enhance our\nfranchise.\n6\nTable of Contents\n• Organic growth – We believe our current branch network provides us with the capacity to grow within our existing market areas. We also believe we are\nwell positioned to attract new business and additional experienced personnel as a result of ongoing changes in our competitive markets. We believe the\nmarkets we entered into as a result of historical acquisitions provide us opportunities for organic growth as we now have a presence in several large\nmarkets where our market share has not previously been significant. Through our Centennial CFG franchise, we operate a national lending platform that\nfocuses on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, through our SPF division, we operate a lending platform focusing\non commercial and consumer marine loans. As opportunities arise, we will evaluate new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current\nmarkets and in other attractive market areas. We did not open any de novo branch locations in 2023. However, we will continue to evaluate de novo\nopportunities during 2024 and make decisions on a case-by-case basis in the best interest of the shareholders.\nCommunity Banking Philosophy\nOur community banking philosophy consists of four basic principles:\n• manage our community banking franchise with experienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions\nquickly;\n• provide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships;\n• pursue the business relationships of our local boards of directors, executive officers, stockholders, and customers to actively promote our community\nbank; and\n• maintain our commitment to the communities we serve by supporting civic and nonprofit organizations.\nThese principles, which make up our community banking philosophy, are the driving force for our business. As we streamlined our legacy business into an\nefficient banking network and have integrated new acquisitions, we have preserved lending authority with local management in most cases by using local loan\ncommittees that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve. These committees are empowered with lending authority of up to $6.0 million in\ntheir respective geographic areas. This allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships that these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective\ncommunities to maintain and grow our business. Through experienced and empowered local bankers and board members, we are committed to maintaining a\ncommunity banking experience for our customers.\nOperating Goals\nOur operating goals focus on maintaining strong credit quality, increasing profitability, finding experienced bankers, and maintaining a “fortress” balance\nsheet:\n• Maintain strong credit quality – Credit quality is our first priority. We employ a set of credit standards designed to ensure the proper management of credit\nrisk. Our management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with these credit standards in the different communities served by Centennial\nBank. We have a centralized loan review process, which we believe enables us to take prompt action on potential problem loans. We have historically\ntaken an aggressive approach to resolving problem loans, including those problem loans acquired in our FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted\nacquisitions. We are committed to maintaining high credit quality standards.\n• Continue to improve profitability – We will continue to strive to improve our profitability and achieve high performance ratios as we continue to utilize the\navailable capacity of branches and employees. We believe our profitability is significantly tied to our focus on our efficiency ratio, and we pride ourselves\non operating in a highly efficient manner. To achieve further improvements in operating efficiency, we will continue to focus on increasing revenue from\norganic loan growth, achieving cost savings from any acquisitions, developing and implementing new efficiency initiatives, further streamlining the\nprocesses in our lending and retail operations and improving our purchasing power.\n• Attract and motivate experienced bankers – We believe a major factor in our success has been our ability to attract and motivate bankers who have\nexperience in and knowledge of their local communities. Historically, our hiring and retaining experienced relationship bankers has been integral to our\nability to grow quickly when entering new markets.\n7\nTable of Contents\n• Maintain a “fortress” balance sheet – We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through a focus on four key governing principles: (1) maintain solid\nasset quality; (2) remain well-capitalized; (3) pursue high performance metrics including return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA),\nefficiency ratio and net interest margin; and (4) retain liquidity at the bank holding company level that can be utilized should attractive acquisition\nopportunities be identified or for internal capital needs. We strive to maintain capital levels above the regulatory capital requirements through our focus on\nthese governing principles, which historically has allowed us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they become available without the need for\nadditional capital.\nOur Market Areas\nAs of December 31, 2023, we conducted business principally through 76 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, 63 branches in Texas, five branches in\nAlabama and one branch in New York City. Our branch footprint includes markets in which we are the deposit market share leader as well as markets where we\nbelieve we have opportunities for deposit market share growth. As of December 31, 2023, we also operate loan production offices in Los Angeles, California;\nMiami, Florida and Dallas, Texas through our Centennial CFG division and in Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland through our SPF division.\nLending Activities\nWe originate loans primarily secured by single and multi-family real estate, residential construction and commercial buildings. In addition, we make loans to\nsmall and medium-sized commercial businesses as well as to consumers for a variety of purposes.\nOur loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023, was comprised as follows:\nTotal\nLoans Percentage\nReceivable of portfolio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 5,549,954 38.5 %\nConstruction/land development 2,293,047 15.9\nAgricultural 325,156 2.3\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 1,844,260 12.8\nMultifamily residential 435,736 3.0\nTotal real estate 10,448,153 72.5\nConsumer 1,153,690 8.0\nCommercial and industrial 2,324,991 16.1\nAgricultural 307,327 2.1\nOther 190,567 1.3\nTotal $ 14,424,728 100.0 %\nReal Estate – Non-farm/Non-residential. Non-farm/non-residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by income-producing properties, such as\nshopping/retail centers, hotel/motel properties, office buildings, and industrial/warehouse properties. Commercial lending on income-producing properties typically\ninvolves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties collateralizing the\nloans to cover operating expenses and debt service. This category of loans also includes specialized properties such as churches, marinas, and nursing homes.\nAdditionally, we make commercial mortgage loans to entities to operate in these types of properties, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on\nthe cash flow generated by these entities in the operations of the business. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral.\nWhen this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines.\n8\nTable of Contents\nReal Estate – Construction/Land Development. This category of loans includes loans to residential and commercial developers to purchase raw land and to\ndevelop this land into residential and commercial land developments. In addition, this category includes construction loans for all of the types of real estate loans,\nincluding both commercial and residential. These loans are generally secured by a first lien on the real estate being purchased or developed. Often, the primary\nsource of repayment will be the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral\nwithin the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines.\nReal Estate – Residential. Our residential mortgage loan program primarily originates loans to individuals for the purchase of residential property. We\ngenerally do not retain long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans in our portfolio due to interest rate and collateral risks. Residential mortgage loans to\nindividuals retained in our loan portfolio primarily consisted of approximately 50.1% owner occupied 1-4 family properties and approximately 40.9% non-owner\noccupied 1-4 family properties (rental) as of December 31, 2023 with the remaining 9.0% relating to condos and mobile homes. The primary source of repayment\nfor these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the\nsubject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and\nEvaluation Guidelines.\nConsumer. While our focus is on service to small and medium-sized businesses, we also make a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and\nhousehold purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance\nUSCG registered high-end sail and power boats through our SPF division. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of\nthe individual to whom the loan is made. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal\nbankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. When secured, we may independently assess the value of the collateral using a third-\nparty valuation source.\nCommercial and Industrial. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily consisted of 7.3% unsecured loans, 32.3% inventory/accounts receivable\nfinancing, 8.7% equipment/vehicle financing and 51.7% other, including letters of credit at less than 1%, as of December 31, 2023. This category includes loans to\nsmaller business ventures, credit lines for working capital and short-term inventory financing, for example. These loans are typically secured by the assets of the\nbusiness and are supplemented by personal guaranties of the principals and often mortgages on the principals’ primary residences. The primary source of repayment\nmay be conversion of the assets into cash flow, as in inventory and accounts receivable, or may be cash flow generated by operations, as in equipment/vehicle\nfinancing. Assessing the value of inventory can involve many factors including, but not limited to, type, age, condition, level of conversion and marketability, and\ncan involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of accounts\nreceivable can involve many factors including, but not limited to, concentration, aging, and industry, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an\nindependent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of equipment/vehicles may involve a third-party valuation source, where\napplicable.\nAgricultural Loans. Agricultural loans include loans for financing agricultural production, including loans to businesses or individuals engaged in the\nproduction of timber, poultry, livestock or crops and are not categorized as part of real estate loans. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery,\nlivestock, crops, vehicles or other agricultural-related collateral. A portion of our portfolio of agricultural loans is comprised of loans to individuals which would\nnormally be characterized as consumer loans except for the fact that the individual borrowers are primarily engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock\nor crops.\nCredit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of the loans that we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the\nborrower to repay the loan. General economic conditions and the strength of the services and retail market segments affect borrower creditworthiness. General\nfactors affecting a commercial borrower’s ability to repay include interest rates, inflation and the demand for the commercial borrower’s products and services as\nwell as other factors affecting a borrower’s customers, suppliers and employees.\nRisks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, and in the case of\ncommercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower’s management. Consumer loan repayments depend upon the borrower’s financial stability and are more likely to\nbe adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships.\n9\nTable of Contents\nLending Policies. We have established common loan documentation procedures and policies, based on the type of loan, for our bank subsidiary. The board of\ndirectors periodically reviews these policies for validity. In addition, it has been and will continue to be our practice to attempt to independently verify information\nprovided by our borrowers, including assets and income. We have not made loans similar to those commonly referred to as “no doc” or “stated income” loans. We\nfocus on the primary and secondary methods of repayment and prepare global cash flows where appropriate. There are legal restrictions on the dollar amount of\nloans available for each lending relationship. The Arkansas Banking Code provides that no loan relationship may exceed 20% of a bank’s risk-based capital, and we\nare in compliance with this restriction. In addition, we are not dependent upon any single lending relationship for an amount exceeding 10% of our revenues. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the maximum amount outstanding to a single borrower was $232.7 million. As primarily a community lender, we believe from time to time it\nis in our best interest to agree to modifications or restructurings. These modifications/restructurings can take the form of a reduction in interest rate, a move to\ninterest-only from principal and interest payments, or a lengthening in the amortization period or any combination thereof. Occasionally, we will modify/restructure\na single loan by splitting it into two loans following the interagency guidance involving the workout of commercial real estate loans. The loan representing the\nportion that is supported by the current cash flow of the borrower or project will remain on our books, while the new loan representing the portion that cannot be\nserviced by the current cash flow is charged-off. Furthermore, we may make an additional loan or loans to a borrower or related interest of a borrower who is past\ndue more than 90 days. These circumstances will be very limited in nature, and when approved by the appropriate lending authority, will likely involve obtaining\nadditional collateral that will improve the collectability of the overall relationship. It is our belief that judicious usage of these tools can improve the quality of our\nloan portfolio by providing our borrowers an improved probability of survival during difficult economic times.\nLoan Approval Procedures. Our bank subsidiary has supplemented our common loan policies to establish its loan approval procedures as follows:\n• Individual Authorities. The board of directors of Centennial Bank establishes the authorization levels for individual loan officers on a case-by-case basis.\nGenerally, the more experienced a loan officer, the higher the authorization level. The approval authority for individual loan officers ranges from $5,000 to\n$3.0 million for secured loans and from $1,000 to $3.0 million for unsecured loans.\n• Officers’ Loan Committees. Our bank subsidiary also gives its Officers’ Loan Committees loan approval authority. Credits in excess of individual loan\nlimits are submitted to the region’s Officers’ Loan Committee. The Officers’ Loan Committee consists of members of the senior management team of that\nregion and is chaired by that region’s chief lending officer. The regional Officers’ Loan Committees have approval authority of up to $2.0 million secured\non all loans and $100,000 unsecured on loan renewals.\n• Directors’ Loan Committee. Our bank subsidiary has Directors’ Loan Committees (“DLCs”) throughout our market areas consisting of outside directors\nand senior lenders of the respective market areas. Generally, each DLC requires a majority of outside directors be present to establish a quorum. Generally,\nthis committee is chaired either by the Division Chief Lending Officer or the Regional President. The regional DLCs have approval authority up to $6.0\nmillion secured and $500,000 unsecured.\n• Executive Loan Committee – The board of directors of Centennial Bank established the Executive Loan Committee consisting of outside board members\nand members of executive management. This committee requires five voting members to establish a quorum, including at least two of the outside board\nmembers, and is chaired by the Chief Lending Officer of the bank. The Executive Loan Committee has approval authority up to the Bank’s legal lending\nlimit, subject to exception approval by the full Board for single loans over $100 million or relationships over $200 million. In addition, any relationship\nabove $40 million must have the specific approval of two of the following: the Chairman, the Vice Chairman or our director Richard H. Ashley.\nCurrently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $40.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining\nthe approval of two of the following: the Chairman, Vice Chairman or our director Richard H. Ashley. We have 79 separate relationships that exceed this in-house\nlimit.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nOur principal source of funds for loans and investing in securities is core deposits. We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings,\nmoney market accounts and certificates of deposit. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals and small businesses, and municipalities in our market areas.\nWe believe that the rates we offer for core deposits are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market areas. Additionally, our policy\nalso permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve\nBank Discount Window, Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program (\"BTFP\") and other borrowings. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates\nand terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us.\nOther Banking Services\nGiven customer demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour internet banking, mobile\nbanking and voice response information, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, United States savings bonds and automatic\naccount transfers. We earn fees for most of these services. We also receive ATM transaction fees from transactions performed by our customers participating in a\nshared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers can use throughout the United States, as well as in other countries.\nTrust and Investment Services\nThrough Centennial Bank and its trust operating subsidiary, GoldStar Trust Company, we provide trust, wealth management and custodial services to\ncustomers throughout our footprint from offices in Arkansas and Texas. We had approximately $5.23 billion of assets under management and custody as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The bank offers a wide variety of trust and estate planning products and services including serving as trustee for personal trusts, testamentary\ntrusts, life insurance trusts, special needs trusts, charitable trusts, 401(k) retirement plans, profit sharing plans and pension plans. In addition the bank offers\nadministrative services such as estate administration and settlement, guardianship and conservator administration, investment management, farm and property\nmanagement, section 1031 like-kind exchanges and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. The bank also offers managed and self-directed IRAs. Centennial Bank\nalso contracts with Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“Ameriprise”), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, to offer and sell various securities and\nother financial products to customers through associates who are employed by both Centennial Bank and Ameriprise.\nGoldStar Trust Company is a limited services trust company with a focus on providing alternative asset custodial services for assets not generally held by\ntraditional brokerage and investment firms. Other products and services provided include trustee services, escrow and paying agent services. All accounts under\nmanagement of GoldStar Trust Company are self-directed accounts in which the investment instruction is provided by the end client or their third party financial\nadvisor.\nInsurance\nCentennial Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1959 and purchased by Centennial Bank in 2000. Centennial\nInsurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including insurance for property, casualty, life, health and employee benefits. It is\nsubject to regulation by the Arkansas Insurance Department. The offices of Centennial Insurance Agency are currently located in Jacksonville, Cabot and Conway,\nArkansas.\nCook Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1913 and acquired by Centennial Bank in 2010 during our FDIC-\nassisted acquisition of Gulf State Community Bank. Cook Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including life insurance.\nIt is subject to regulation by the Florida Insurance Department. The offices of Cook Insurance Agency are located in Apalachicola and Crawfordville, Florida.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nAs of December 31, 2023, we conducted business through 223 branch locations in our primary market areas of Pulaski, Faulkner, Craighead, Lonoke, Pope,\nWashington, White, Benton, Greene, Sebastian, Cleburne, Independence, Stone, Baxter, Clay, Conway, Crawford, Johnson, Saline, Sharp and Yell counties in\nArkansas; Broward, Monroe, Hillsborough, Leon, Sarasota, Bay, Franklin, Palm Beach, Gulf, Charlotte, Collier, Escambia, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk,\nWalton, Miami-Dade, Lee, Calhoun, Gadsden, Hernando, Liberty, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Seminole, Wakulla and Manatee counties in Florida; Bailey; Briscoe;\nCarson; Castro; Collin; Comal; Dallam; Dallas; Deaf Smith; Floyd; Garza; Gillespie; Gray; Hale; Hall; Hemphill; Hutchinson; Kendall; Kerr; Lamb; Lipscomb;\nLubbock; Lynn; Moore; Motley; Potter; Randall; Sherman; Swisher; Tarrant; Taylor; Travis; Wheeler and Williamson counties in Texas; Baldwin County in\nAlabama; and New York County in New York. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas.\nThese institutions include many of the largest banks operating in these respective states, including some of the largest banks in the country. Many of our\ncompetitors serve the same counties we do. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer\nvarious services that we may not currently offer and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than\nwe do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, and flexibility and the ability to\nmake credit and other business decisions quickly.\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral. Our community banking philosophy relies heavily on the personal relationships and the quality of service provided by employees. We rely on\nexperienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions quickly. Experienced and empowered local bankers and\nboard members facilitate our commitment to provide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships. At the local level, we have preserved lending\nauthority by using local loan committees that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve, which allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships\nthat these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective communities to maintain and grow our business. Accordingly, we aim to attract, develop\nand retain employees who can drive financial and strategic growth objectives and build long-term shareholder value while executing our community banking\nphilosophy.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had 2,819 full-time equivalent employees. Except for any additional employees acquired in future acquisitions, we expect that our\n2024 staffing levels will be lower than those at year end 2023 as a reflection of the efforts taken during the fourth quarter of 2023. We consider our employee\nrelations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees.\nIn managing the Company’s business, management focuses on various human capital measures and objectives designed to address the development, attraction\nand retention of personnel. These include competitive compensation and benefits, paid time off, an employee retirement plan, bonus and other incentive\ncompensation plans, modern equipment and support, leadership development and professional development as well as those benefits described below.\nDiversity and Inclusion. We seek to recognize the unique contribution each individual brings to the Company, and we understand the associated value that\ncomes with a diverse workforce. We strive to offer an inclusive environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed. As of December 31, 2023, 69%\nof our employees were women and 27% of our employees identify as a person of color. Further, as of December 31, 2023, 62% of the Company’s leadership\npositions were held by women.\nEmployee Safety and Health. The health and well-being of our employees is a priority for our business. Our full-time officers and employees are provided\nhospitalization and major medical insurance. We pay a substantial part of the premiums for these coverages. We also provide other basic insurance coverage\nincluding dental, life, and long-term disability insurance.\nAlthough our offices have generally returned to a normal working environment following the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to support working remotely\nfor those employees who have a need to telework for health reasons and in certain other circumstances. We also stand ready to re-implement COVID-19 safety\nprotocols should circumstances dictate due a future outbreak of the virus or another public health crisis.\n12\nTable of Contents\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive state and federal banking regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory\noversight of our company and its operations. These laws generally are intended to protect depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (“FDIC”) and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders.\nThe following discussion describes significant elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us. This description is a summary, does not purport to be\ncomplete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and\npolicies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory\npolicies applicable to us and our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because our bank\nsubsidiary’s total assets exceed $10 billion, it is subject to additional supervision and regulation, including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”),\nwith such additional supervision and regulation discussed throughout this section.\nHome BancShares\nWe are a bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”), and we and our\nsubsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject\nbank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities,\nincluding regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Bank Holding Company Act provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of\nbank holding companies by the Federal Reserve Board and functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities\nregulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators.\nDodd Frank and the EGRRCPA. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes\nin the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the\npractices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection\nAct (the “EGRRCPA”), signed into law in May 2018, made certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other\npost-financial crisis regulations. Some of the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA provisions are described in more detail below.\nPermitted Activities. A bank holding company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of\nmore than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:\n• banking or managing or controlling banks; and\n• any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.\nActivities that the Federal Reserve Board has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include but are not\nlimited to: factoring accounts receivable; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; leasing personal or real property; operating a\nnon-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; trust company functions; financial and investment advisory activities; conducting securities\nbrokerage activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing specified management consulting and\ncounseling activities; performing selected data processing services and support services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of\ninsurance in connection with credit transactions; and performing selected insurance underwriting activities.\nSupport of Subsidiary Institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for our bank subsidiary and to commit\nresources to support the bank. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve the authority to require us to make capital injections into our bank subsidiary and to\ncharge us with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if we fail to commit resources to our bank subsidiary or if we undertake actions that the Federal Reserve\nbelieves might jeopardize our ability to commit resources to the bank. As a result, an obligation to support our bank subsidiary may be required at times when,\nwithout this requirement, we might not be inclined to provide it.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSafe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve\nBoard’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its\nown equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10%\nor more of the company’s consolidated net worth. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board requires prior approval of any redemption or repurchase of preferred\nstock or subordinated debt. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nor would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and\nunsound banking practices, or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing\nand reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as approximately $2 million for each day the\nactivity continues.\nAnnual Reporting; Examinations. We are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal\nReserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company or any of its\nsubsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such examination.\nCapital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank\nholding companies having $500 million or more in assets on a consolidated basis. Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk\nweights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk-weighted”\nasset base.\nThe current risk-based capital requirements applicable to all depository institutions and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million\nor more and savings and loan holding companies (collectively, “banking organizations”), and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets, are based on\nagreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking\nSystems” (“Basel III”) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as modified by certain capital simplification rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and\nother federal bank regulatory agencies in 2019. The final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal bank regulatory agencies in 2013 based on\nBasel III (the “Basel III final rule”) requires us to maintain minimum capital ratios with respect to common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and total\ncapital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital), each as compared to our risk-weighted assets, as well as a “leverage ratio” calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to\naverage consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements. The Basel III final rule also limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets,\nwhich is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe required minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Basel III capital adequacy requirements in effect as of December 31, 2023, including the required\ncapital conservation buffer, consist of CET1 capital of 7.0% (4.5% plus the required 2.5% capital conservation buffer), Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8.5% (6.0% plus\nthe required 2.5% capital conservation buffer), total risk-based capital of 10.5% (8.0% plus the required 2.5% capital conservation buffer) and a leverage ratio of\n4.0%. As of December 31, 2023, our capital conservation buffer was 8.15%, and our CET1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage\nratios were 14.15%, 14.15%, 17.79% and 12.44%, respectively.\nThe Basel III final rule adopted in 2013 permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and\noutstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The\nrule phased out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. Because our total\nconsolidated assets were less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, our outstanding trust preferred securities continued to be treated as Tier 1 capital until the\ncompletion of our acquisition of Happy Bancshares on April 1, 2022, after which those securities were treated as Tier 2 capital. During the second and third\nquarters of 2022, the Company redeemed, without penalty, all of its outstanding trust preferred securities. As a result, the Company no longer holds any trust\npreferred securities.\nThe federal banking agencies’ risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain\nspecified criteria. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios\nwhen circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be\nexpected to maintain strong capital positions, substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning the capital regulations of the federal banking agencies. These provisions, often referred to as the\n“Collins Amendment,” are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly\nreduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. The Collins Amendment requires banking regulators to\ndevelop regulations setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less\nstringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. The\nbanking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and\ndecrease in times of economic contraction.\nPrompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 or “FDICIA” establishes a system of prompt corrective action\nto resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-\ncapitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) in which all institutions are placed. Federal\nbanking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in\nthe three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The federal banking agencies\nhave specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category.\nAn institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital\nrestoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets,\nmaking acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval.\nThe regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.\nThe Basel III final rule amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a CET1 capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain\ncapital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least an 8%\ntotal risk-based capital ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a CET1 4.5% risk-based capital ratio and a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be well-capitalized, a\nbanking organization is required to have at least a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, an 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 6.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio and\na 5% Tier 1 leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, we met all capital adequacy requirements and our bank subsidiary is considered well-capitalized for\nregulatory purposes.\nLiquidity Requirements. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests.\nOne test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute\nliquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the\nassets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are expected to incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S.\nTreasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. Rules applicable to certain large\nbanking organizations have been implemented for LCR and for NSFR; however, based on our asset size, these rules do not currently apply to us or our bank\nsubsidiary.\nStress Testing. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board published its final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The\nrules required institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary, to conduct an annual\ncompany-run stress test of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by bank regulatory agencies. The\nEGRRCPA raised the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing, liquidity coverage and living will requirements for bank holding companies\nto $250 billion, subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or\nsafety and soundness concerns. On July 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) issued a joint\ninteragency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA. As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, we and our bank subsidiary are no longer subject to\nDodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through\ninteragency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed\nthrough the regular supervisory process. We will continue to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators.\n15\nTable of Contents\nRisk Management. Regulation YY initially required publicly-traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets to establish a risk\ncommittee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices. The committee must be chaired by an independent director and include at least\none risk management expert with experience in managing risk exposures of large, complex firms. As a result of our total assets exceeding $10 billion, we\nestablished a risk committee meeting these requirements. However, in 2018 the EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees from $10\nbillion to $50 billion in total assets. While we are no longer required to maintain a risk committee, we currently continue to utilize our risk committee to oversee\nour enterprise-wide risk management practices.\nRegulation YY also requires us, as a publicly-traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, to have a global risk\nmanagement framework commensurate with their structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size. The risk management framework must include risk\nmanagement policies and procedures, as well as processes and controls to implement them. Accordingly, we have adopted a compliant risk management\nframework.\nPayment of Dividends. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank subsidiary and other affiliated entities. The principal sources of our cash flow,\nincluding cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, are dividends that our bank subsidiary pays to us as its sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory\nlimitations apply to the dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us, as well as to the dividends we can pay to our shareholders.\nUnder Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank and should not pay cash dividends to\nits shareholders at a level that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiary or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other\narrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the\nprovisions of Arkansas law.\nThere are certain state-law limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiary. Centennial Bank, which is subject to Arkansas banking laws, may\nnot declare or pay a dividend of 75% or more of the net profits of such bank after all taxes for the current year plus 75% of the retained net profits for the\nimmediately preceding year without the prior approval of the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner (the “Bank Commissioner”). Members of the Federal Reserve\nSystem must also comply with the dividend restrictions with which a national bank would be required to comply. Among other things, these restrictions require that\nif losses have at any time been sustained by a bank equal to or exceeding its undivided profits then on hand, no dividend may be paid. Although we have\nhistorically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to pay dividends in the future under the applicable\nregulatory limitations.\nThe payment of dividends by us, or by our bank subsidiary, may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above\nregulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level\nwould be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, as discussed below, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would result\nin the depository institution being undercapitalized.\nAcquisitions of Banks. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval before:\n• acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or\nindirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank’s voting shares;\n• acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or\n• merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.\nUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, if well-capitalized and well managed, we, as well as other bank holding companies located within the states in which\nwe operate, may purchase a bank located outside of those states. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of the\nstates in which we operate may purchase a bank located inside those states. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has\nonly been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding\ncompanies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding\ncompany and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors.\n16\nTable of Contents\nSubsidiary Bank\nGeneral. Our bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank, is chartered as an Arkansas state bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making it primarily\nsubject to regulation and supervision by both the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department. In addition, our bank subsidiary is subject to\nvarious requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and\namounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that they may charge, and limitations on the types of investments they may make and on the types of services\nthey may offer. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of our bank subsidiary. Further, because our bank subsidiary has total assets of\nover $10 billion, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal\nconsumer protection laws.\nDeposit Insurance and Assessments. Centennial Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”).\nThe Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit coverage limit to $250,000 per depositor retroactive to January 1, 2008.\nThe FDIC imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based primarily on the risk category of the institution and\ncertain risk adjustments specified by the FDIC, with riskier institutions paying higher assessments. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured\ninstitutions with at least $10 billion in assets are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institution’s regulatory ratings and certain financial\nmeasures. The scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that will be combined and converted to\nan initial assessment rate. The performance score measures an institution’s financial performance and its ability to withstand stress. The loss severity score\nquantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution’s failure. Once the performance and loss severity scores are\ncalculated, these scores will be converted to a total score. The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special\nadditional assessments.\nIn 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing changes to the deposit insurance assessment system, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, which,\namong other things, changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to the institution’s average consolidated total\nassets during an assessment period less average tangible equity capital (Tier 1 capital) during that period. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule so that it\nranged from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest institutions. The rule also suspended indefinitely the requirement of the\nFDIC to pay dividends from the DIF when it reaches 1.5% of insured deposits. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit\ninsurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment is expected\nto improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the deadline prescribed under the FDIC’s amended restoration\nplan. The new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2 percent in order to support growth in the DIF in\nprogressing toward the FDIC’s long-term goal of a 2 percent reserve ratio. Progressively lower assessment rate schedules will take effect when the reserve ratio\nreaches 2 percent, and again when it reaches 2.5 percent. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a\nfinding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable\nlaw, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nAdditionally, in November 2023, based on its systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule to impose a special\nassessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points on the bank’s estimated uninsured deposits in excess of $5 billion to recover the loss to the DIF\nfollowing the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This assessment is only imposed on banks with assets of $5 billion or more. During the fourth\nquarter of 2023, we recorded $13.0 million in FDIC special assessment expense in anticipation of this assessment. The special assessment will be imposed\nbeginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. Because the estimated loss pursuant to\nthe systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, impose an extended special assessment\ncollection period after the initial eight-quarter collection period to collect the difference between losses and the amounts collected, and impose a one-time final\nshortfall special assessment after both receiverships terminate.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, that federal banking\nregulators evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods.\nThese facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could\nimpose additional requirements and limitations on our bank subsidiary. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-\nrelated agreements. Our bank subsidiary received a “satisfactory” CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Bank during its last exam as published in our bank’s CRA\nPublic Evaluation.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCapital Requirements. Our bank subsidiary is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain\nadequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators. The regulating agencies consider a bank’s capital\nlevels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and\nthe banking system. The Federal Reserve Bank monitors the capital adequacy of our bank subsidiary by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage\nratios.\nThe FDIC Improvement Act. FDICIA made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of domestic\nand foreign depository institutions, and improvement of accounting standards. This statute also limited deposit insurance coverage, implemented changes in\nconsumer protection laws and provided for least-cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions.\nFDICIA requires every bank with total assets in excess of $500 million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank’s financial statements by an\nindependent public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the FDIC. FDICIA also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending\non their level of capital.\nThe capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and\naffects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank. Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination\nof every bank at least once every 12 months.\nBrokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. “Well-\ncapitalized” banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not well-capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a\ncase-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. The EGRRCPA, enacted in May 2018, provides that most reciprocal deposits are no\nlonger treated as brokered deposits.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, of which our bank subsidiary is a member, consists of regional FHLBs\ngoverned and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their\nassigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans (i.e., advances)\nto members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the boards of directors of each regional FHLB.\nAs a system member, our bank subsidiary is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of its region and is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the\nFHLB. Our bank subsidiary is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage\nloans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to our bank subsidiary are secured by a portion of its respective\nloan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by such bank.\nFederal Reserve System. In January 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee announced its intention to implement monetary policy in an ample reserves\nregime. Reserve requirements do not play a significant role in this operating framework. In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Federal Reserve\nreduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020. As a result, the Bank is no longer required to maintain required reserve balance\nwith either the FRB or in the form of cash on hand.\nConcentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing\nfinancial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending\nif (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by\nmultifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s\ncommercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a\nconcentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and\nmanagement oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market\nanalysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.\n18\nTable of Contents\nMortgage Banking Operations. Our bank subsidiary is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA with respect to\noriginating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other\nthings, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective\nborrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates.\nConsumer Financial Protection. Our bank subsidiary is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its\nrelationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings\nAct, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement\nProcedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state\nusury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit\nand terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information,\nprovide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the bank’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the bank to\nsubstantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers,\nincluding actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also\nseek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the\nstate and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which our bank subsidiary operates and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection\nrequirements may also result in our bank subsidiary’s failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the bank may\nwish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater. The CFPB\nfocuses its supervision and regulatory efforts on (1) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws when it evaluates the policies and\npractices of a financial institution; (2) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; (3) depository institutions\nthat offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; (4) certain depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and (5) non-depository\ncompanies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to\nprohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to\nunderstand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (1) lack of financial savvy, (2) inability\nto protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or (3) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests.\nThe CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action\nagainst an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement\nauthority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates.\nLoans to One Borrower. Our bank subsidiary generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of\nunimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable\ncollateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2023, our bank subsidiary was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower\nlimitations.\nProhibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Under Regulation Y, our bank holding company and bank subsidiary are prohibited, subject to some exceptions,\nfrom extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the\ncustomer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.\nChange in Control. Federal and state laws, including the Change in Bank Control Act, impose prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory\nrequirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. “Control” of a\ndepository institution is generally defined where an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25% or\nmore of any class of voting securities.\nRestrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. We and our bank subsidiary are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A\nimposes limits on the amount of transactions between the bank and its affiliates and requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits\nthe amount of advances to affiliates which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank or its nonbanking affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is\ngenerally any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAffiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain other transactions between the bank and\nits affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at that time for comparable transactions with or involving\nother non-affiliated persons.\nSections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation O, also place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive\nofficers, directors, and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and\ncertain of their related interests, or insiders, and insiders of affiliates, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests,\nthe bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limit. Section 22(h) also requires that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as\noffered in comparable transactions to other persons, unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to\nemployees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank. In addition, Section 22(h) requires prior board of director’s\napproval for certain loans, and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus.\nFurthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.\nInterchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether\nthe interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for\nprocessing such transactions. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to our bank subsidiary and other card-issuing banks for processing\nelectronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum\npermissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. A debit\ncard issuer may also recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing\ntransactions on each debit or prepaid product.\nThe Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds\nand private equity funds. The statutory provision, which has been implemented by rules adopted by federal regulators, is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” The\nVolcker Rule also requires covered banking entities, including us and our bank subsidiary, to implement certain compliance programs, and the complexity and rigor\nof such programs is determined based on the asset size and complexity of the business of the covered company. Since neither we nor our bank subsidiary engages\nin the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on our or our bank subsidiary’s operations.\nPrivacy. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information.\nCustomers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow\ncircumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a\nnonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in\ntelemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. We and our subsidiary have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance\nwith all privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nWe are also subject to various regulatory guidance as updated from time to time and implemented by the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council\n(the “FFIEC”), an interagency body of the FDIC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities.\nThe FFIEC has provided guidance in areas such as data privacy, disaster recovery, information security, and third-party vendor management to identify potential\nrisks related to our services that could adversely affect our customers. In addition, lawmakers, regulators and the public are increasingly focused on the use of\npersonal information and efforts to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to\ndevelop, and we expect regulation in these areas to continue to increase.\nAnti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Legislation. Our bank subsidiary is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and rules and regulations of the Office\nof Foreign Assets Control (the “OFAC”). These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and\naccount relationships intended to guard against money laundering, terrorism financing and transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others on\nwhom the United States has imposed economic sanctions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the\ninstitution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to\nprohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAs part of our bank subsidiary’s anti-money laundering (“AML”) program, we are required to designate a BSA officer, maintain a BSA/AML training\nprogram, maintain internal controls to effectuate the BSA/AML program, implement independent testing of the BSA/AML program, and comply with the Financial\nCrimes Enforcement Network’s “Customer Due Diligence for Financial Institutions Rule” (the “CDD Rule”). The CDD Rule adds a new requirement for our bank\nsubsidiary to identify and verify the identity of natural persons (“beneficial owners”) of legal entity customers who own, control and profit from companies when\nthose companies open accounts. The CDD Rule requires covered financial institutions to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that are reasonably\ndesigned to (1) identify and verify the identity of customers; (2) identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of companies opening accounts; (3)\nunderstand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop customer risk profiles; and (4) conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report\nsuspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information. With respect to the new requirement to obtain beneficial ownership\ninformation, financial institutions will have to identify and verify the identity of any individuals who own 25 percent or more of a legal entity, and an individual\nwho controls the legal entity.\nIncentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting\nincentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an\nexecutive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the\nentity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation\narrangements.\nIn June 2010, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive\ncompensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The\nguidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based\nupon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and\nfinancial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls\nand risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.\nIn May 2016, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published a revised version of proposed rulemaking initially issued in\nApril 2011 designed to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking\nat a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary. The\nproposed joint compensation regulations would require compensation practices consistent with the three principles discussed above. As of February 1, 2024, these\nregulations have not been finalized; however, the agencies have indicated that they intend to issue a third proposed rule in the near future. Unless and until a final\nrule is adopted, we cannot fully determine whether compliance with such a rule will adversely affect the Company’s or our bank subsidiary’s ability to hire, retain\nand motivate our key employees.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that\nrequire listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or “clawback” of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive\nofficer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would\nresult in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The corresponding NYSE listing rule was\napproved by the SEC in June 2023 and required listed companies to adopt a compliant clawback policy by December 1, 2023. Our board of directors adopted such\na policy on October 20, 2023.\nThe Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking\norganizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and\ncomplexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included\nin reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make\nacquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-\nmanagement control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective\nmeasures to correct the deficiencies.\n21\nTable of Contents\nCustomer Information Security. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, nonpublic customer\ninformation. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee\nthereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer\ninformation, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of\nsuch information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Our bank subsidiary has adopted a customer information security program\nto comply with these requirements.\nArkansas Law. Our bank subsidiary is subject to regulation and examination by the Arkansas State Bank Department. Under the Arkansas Banking Code of\n1997, approval of the Bank Commissioner is required for the acquisition of more than 25% of any class of the outstanding capital stock of any bank. The Bank\nCommissioner’s approval is also required in order for us to make bank acquisitions, amend our articles of incorporation, repurchase shares of our capital stock\n(other than payments to dissenting shareholders in a transaction), issue preferred stock or debt, increase, reduce or retire any part of our capital stock, retire debt\ninstruments, or conduct certain types of activities that are incidental or closely related to banking. The Bank Commissioner has the authority, with the consent of\nthe Governor of the State of Arkansas, to declare a state of emergency and temporarily modify or suspend banking laws and regulations in communities where such\na state of emergency exists. The Bank Commissioner may also authorize a bank to close its offices and any day when such bank offices are closed will be treated as\na legal holiday, and any director, officer or employee of such bank shall not incur any liability related to such emergency closing. No such state of emergency has\nbeen declared to exist by the Bank Commissioner to date.\nRegulatory Developments Relating to the CARES Act\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to\nprovide national emergency economic relief measures. The CARES Act’s programs were implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments\nand agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other federal bank regulatory authorities, including those with direct supervisory\njurisdiction over the Company and its bank subsidiary. Set forth below is a brief overview of select provisions of the CARES Act and other regulations and\nsupervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are applicable to the operations and activities of the Company and its bank subsidiary.\nPaycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). The CARES Act established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business\nAdministration (“SBA”) called the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which provided for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private\nfinancial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our bank subsidiary participated in the\nPPP as a lender. These loans were eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions were satisfied and were fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments\nwere deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through May 31, 2021. No\ncollateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders were permitted to charge the recipients any fees. The majority of our bank\nsubsidiary’s PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022, were forgiven or repaid during 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining balance of outstanding\nPPP loans was considered immaterial.\nTemporary Regulatory Capital Relief related to Impact of Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”). Concurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, the federal\nbank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the implementation of CECL. The interim\nfinal rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banking organizations that implemented CECL during 2020 the option to\ndelay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a\nthree-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020\nand have elected to utilize the five-year transition option.\nProposed Legislation and Regulatory Action\nFrom time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such\ninitiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the\nfinancial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment for us and our bank subsidiary in substantial\nand unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the\ncompetitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed\nregulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Additionally, we cannot predict the\nimpact of potential judicial interpretations of regulations or the outcome of the upcoming election cycle on banking statutes and regulations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nEffect of Governmental Monetary Polices\nOur earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal\nReserve Board’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its\npower to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve\nBoard affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the\ndiscount rate applicable to banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes\nin monetary and fiscal policies.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy\nstatements and other information with the SEC. In addition, we maintain a website at http://www.homebancshares.com. We make available on our website copies\nof our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such documents as soon as\npracticable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish such documents to the SEC.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business exposes us to certain risks. Risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on may also adversely affect our business and\noperation. The following is a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition and future results.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business,\nand changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. As a registered bank holding company, we are primarily\nregulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Our bank subsidiary is also primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department.\nBanking industry regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not\nsecurity holders. Complying with such regulations is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers\nand acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements by\nour regulators. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank\nacquisitions.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed by\nCongress in 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention\nin the financial services sector during the economic recession leading up to its enactment. The act required the issuance of a substantial number of new regulations\nby federal regulatory agencies affecting financial institutions, some of which still have yet to be issued or implemented.\nWhile the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2018 reduced certain regulatory burdens on community and regional\nfinancial institutions resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, we cannot assure that future legislation will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or\notherwise have a significant impact on our business. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the act may continue to be\nimplemented, and there could be additional new federal or state laws, regulations and policies regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards.\nAdditionally, financial institution regulatory agencies have intensified their response to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including through the\nissuance of formal enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry or other new legislation or regulations could adversely impact our\noperations and our financial performance by subjecting us to additional costs, restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans,\nand/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAs regulation of the banking industry continues to evolve, we expect the costs of compliance to continue to increase and, thus, to affect our ability to operate\nprofitably. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies,\ncompensation or operating plans. If these developments negatively impact our ability to implement our business strategies, it may have a material adverse effect on\nour results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nBecause our total assets exceed $10 billion, we and our bank subsidiary are subject to increased regulatory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act and its\nimplementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets. In addition, banks with $10\nbillion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Previously,\nour bank subsidiary had been subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the Federal Reserve was primarily responsible for examining our bank subsidiary’s\ncompliance with consumer protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, the CFPB’s\nexamination and regulatory authority has been and continues to be the subject of policy debates and uncertainty among lawmakers and differing presidential\nadministrations, and thus we cannot ascertain the impact, if any, that future changes to the CFPB may have on our business.\nBanks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to a deposit assessment based on a scorecard issued by the FDIC that considers, among other things, the\nbank’s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the\nresults of the bank’s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 2.5 to 42 basis points. Any increase in our bank subsidiary’s\ndeposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in\ntotal assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve’s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. Our bank subsidiary is\nlimited to receiving only a “reasonable” interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by our bank subsidiary to our\ncustomers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5 basis\npoints of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. This limit in the amount of interchange fees we\nreceive for electronic debit interchange has the effect of reducing our revenues.\nPrior to becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements, we hired additional compliance personnel and implemented structural initiatives to\naddress these requirements. While some of these requirements, such as annual stress testing, were eliminated by the reforms enacted in May 2018, our continued\ncompliance with the remaining requirements and compliance with any additional requirements that may be imposed in the future may necessitate that we hire\nadditional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulators may also consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements\nwhen examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nDifficult market and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nEconomic downturns historically have had a significant adverse impact on the banking industry, and particularly community banks. Declines in the housing\nmarket, with falling home prices and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, can negatively impact the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans\nand result in significant write-downs of assets by financial institutions. Any reduced availability of commercial credit or periods of sustained higher unemployment\ncan further negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Any such market conditions could\ncause commercial and consumer deficiencies, low customer confidence, market volatility and generally sluggish business activity in our industry.\n24\nTable of Contents\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our\nprimary market areas. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, commercial and\nindustrial and consumer lending, including, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Certain economic\nindicators, such as real estate asset values, rents and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets and may lag behind the overall economy. These\neconomic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly than other economic sectors. Additionally, our\nsuccess significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do\nnot grow or if prevailing economic conditions deteriorate locally or nationally, our business may be adversely affected. We are less able than a larger institution to\nspread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. The adverse effects of any future economic downturn on\nus, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market may result in increased foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies as well as more\nrestricted access to funds. Any such negative events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe impacts of national or international pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of contagious disease,\nincluding the COVID-19 virus. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted U.S. and global supply chains and altered business and economic conditions throughout the\nU.S. and globally. Its economic impacts lowered equity market valuations; created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; contributed to a\ndecrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in ratings downgrades, credit deterioration, and defaults in many industries; increased demands\non capital and liquidity; increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence. In addition, the pandemic resulted in temporary or permanent\nclosures of many businesses, the institution of social distancing, face covering requirements and other health directives, and in some cases, self-isolation\nrequirements. The pandemic also caused us to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses.\nThe extent to which any future outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus or other contagious diseases may impact general economic and business conditions is highly\nuncertain and unpredictable. As part of these uncertainties, we could be subject to a number of risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and ability to execute our growth strategy. These risks include, but are not limited to, increased loan\nlosses or other impairments in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses; further volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral\nsupporting loans; impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets; increased cost of capital; inability to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other\nsupervisory requirements; or a downgrade in our credit ratings. We could also face an increased risk of governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the\neffects of a pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Any such occurrence could\nhave a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur FDIC insurance premiums and assessments could increase and result in higher noninterest expense.\nOur bank subsidiary’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits, and accordingly, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. As our bank\nsubsidiary exceeds $10 billion in assets, we are subject to higher FDIC assessments. Our bank subsidiary’s regular assessments are calculated under the large bank\npricing rule using its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as well as by risk classification, which includes regulatory capital levels.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount and timetable for payment of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. There is no guarantee\nthat our assessment rate will not increase in the future. Additionally, if there is an increase in bank or financial institution failures or there is a future need to\nstrengthen the DIF reserve ratio, the FDIC may further revise the assessment rates or the risk-based assessment system. Such changes may require us to pay higher\nFDIC premiums than our current levels, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments, either of which would increase our noninterest expense.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and monetary policy and could be adversely affected by any future actions taken by the Federal\nReserve Board to address rising inflation.\nOur results of operations are affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and thus\nsubject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates. Consequently, our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and\nour ability to manage interest rate risk. Changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or\nchanges in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest paid on\ninterest-bearing liabilities. This difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread. In addition\nto affecting our profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect our business and\nprofitability in numerous other ways. For example, increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing loan demand and\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their current obligations, while decreases in interest rates may affect loan prepayments.\nIn response to recent inflation and its affects on U.S. business and consumers, the Federal Reserve Board implemented eleven interest rate increases since\nMarch 2022. However, in response to slowing inflation, it is expected that the Federal Reserve Board will begin reducing interest rates sometime in 2024. Future\neconomic developments and the Federal Reserve Board’s policies in response, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. At this time, it is unknown how future\naction by the Federal Reserve Board involving monetary policies will affect our business and the banking industry. There can be no assurance that any future\nactions by the Federal Reserve Board involving monetary policies will not cause any of the adverse effects described above on our deposit levels, loan demand or\nbusiness and earnings\nWe may experience future adverse impacts from the recent transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index.\nWe have certain loans that were originally indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR index has not been published since June\n2023, which necessitated the refinancing of the existing loans which were indexed to LIBOR. While these loans have been transitioned to a LIBOR alternative, a\nresidual risk remains for transition issues. The transition impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, and\nproduct design. Additionally, the new index rates and payments differ from LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility. Residual issues that may remain from\nthis transition are not certain and any failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers may adversely impact our reputation.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us, and we may incur losses on investments in other financial institutions.\nThe financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and\nroutinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other substantial\nparticipants. In addition, we currently hold and may in the future acquire additional investments in the debt or equity securities of other financial institutions. Some\nof the institutions or other participants with whom we transact business or in which we hold investments may experience instability due to financial challenges in\nthe banking industry or may be perceived to be unstable. If any of these institutions or participants were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or\nwere to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Our investments in any such institutions could decline in value or become valueless, which could result in us\nincurring losses in our investment portfolio that may have a materially adverse effect our operating results. Further, our stock price may be negatively impacted by\nfailures of other financial institutions and their effects on consumer and investor confidence, and we may experience increased deposit insurance premiums,\nincreased regulatory scrutiny and other adverse effects on our business, profitability or financial condition as a result of these failures.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for credit losses may be inadequate, which would materially and adversely affect us.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the\nvalue of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our secured loans. We endeavor to maintain an allowance for credit losses that we\nconsider adequate to absorb future losses that may occur in our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was approximately $288.2\nmillion, or 2.00% of our total loans. In determining the size of the allowance, we analyze our loan portfolio based on our historical loss experience, volume and\nclassification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIf our assumptions are incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient to absorb future loan losses, and increased loan loss reserves may be needed to\nrespond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. When there is an economic downturn, it is more difficult for us to estimate\nthe losses that we will experience in our loan portfolio. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require\nus to increase our allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our\nallowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur high concentration of real estate loans and especially commercial real estate loans exposes us to increased lending risk.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 72.5% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of\ncollateral. This includes commercial real estate loans (excluding construction/land development) of $5.88 billion, or 40.8% of total loans, construction/land\ndevelopment loans of $2.29 billion, or 15.9% of total loans, and residential real estate loans of $2.28 billion, or 15.8% of total loans. This high concentration of real\nestate loans could subject us to increased credit risk in the event of a decrease in real estate values in our markets, a real estate recession or a natural disaster. Also,\nin any such event, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling real estate collateral would be diminished, and we would be more likely to\nsuffer losses on defaulted loans.\nIn addition to the risks associated with the high concentration of real estate-secured loans, the commercial real estate and construction/land development loans,\nwhich comprised 56.7% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023, expose us to a greater risk of loss than our residential real estate loans, which\ncomprised 15.8% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate and land development loans typically involve larger loan balances to\nsingle borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one\ncredit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan.\nThe repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial project.\nIf the cash flows from the project are reduced, a borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. This cash flow shortage may result in the failure to make\nloan payments. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan, or in the most extreme cases, we may have to foreclose.\nIf a decline in economic conditions or other issues cause difficulties for our borrowers of these types of loans, if we fail to evaluate the credit of these loans\naccurately when we underwrite them or if we do not continue to adequately monitor the performance of these loans, our lending portfolio could experience\ndelinquencies, defaults and credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur geographic concentration of banking activities and loan portfolio makes us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in our local markets.\nOur bank subsidiary operates through branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama and New York City and loan production offices in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. However, approximately 79.8% of our total loans and 84.6% of our real\nestate loans as of December 31, 2023, are to borrowers whose collateral is located in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama and New York, the states in which the\nCompany has its branch locations. An adverse development with respect to the market conditions of any of these specific market areas or a decrease in real estate\nvalues in those market areas could expose us to a greater risk of loss than a portfolio that is spread among a larger geographic base.\nIf the value of real estate were to deteriorate, a significant portion of our loans could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect\non us.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 72.5% of our total loans were secured by real estate. In prior years, difficult local economic conditions have\nadversely affected the values of our real estate collateral, and they could do so again if the economic conditions markets were to deteriorate in the future. The real\nestate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment on our loans in the event of default by the borrower but may deteriorate in value during the\ntime credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings\nand capital could be adversely affected.\n27\nTable of Contents\nBecause we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers, a significant loss on any of those loans could materially and adversely\naffect us.\nWe have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. Under applicable law, our bank subsidiary is generally permitted to make loans to\none borrowing relationship up to 20% of its Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2023, the legal lending limit of our bank\nsubsidiary for secured loans was approximately $556.7 million. Our board of directors has established an in-house lending limit of $40.0 million to any one\nborrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of two of the following: our Chairman, John W. Allison, our Vice Chairman, Jack E. Engelkes, or our\ndirector Richard H. Ashley. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of $6.93 billion, or 48.1% of our total loans, committed to the aggregate group of borrowers\nwhose total debt exceeds the established in-house lending limit of $40.0 million.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally obtained funds\nprincipally through local deposits, and we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a more stable source of funds than\nother borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders. In\naddition, local deposits reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are less stable time deposits, which may need to be\nreplaced with higher cost funds. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if and to the extent we must rely upon\nhigher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could\nadversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nThe loss of key employees may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success depends significantly on our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, John W. Allison, and our executive officers, especially Brian S.\nDavis, J. Stephen Tipton and Kevin D. Hester plus Centennial Bank Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Tracy M. French, as well as other key\nCentennial Bank personnel. Centennial Bank, in particular, relies heavily on its management team’s relationships in its local communities to generate business. The\nloss of services from a member of our current management team may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nfuture prospects.\nThe value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned $3.51 billion of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities may\nbe adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular\nsecurities in our investments portfolio. We evaluate all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position requires a provision for credit losses in\naccordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not\nthat the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is\nmet, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether\nthe decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than\namortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this\nassessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of\nthe security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is\nrecorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of)\ncredit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the\ncriteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to record\nprovisions for credit losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned $1.28 billion of held-to-maturity investment securities. Securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security\nfor which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of\ndiscounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the\nsecurity. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC\n326. The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit losses and report\naccrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss\nexpense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed. Because of changing economic and\nmarket conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to record provisions for credit losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur recent results do not indicate our future results and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock.\nWe are unlikely to sustain our historical rate of growth and may not even be able to expand our business at all. Further, our growth in prior years may distort\nsome of our historical financial ratios and statistics. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may\nalso impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.\nFederal and state regulatory authorities require us and our bank subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe\nthat our existing capital (which well exceeds the federal and state capital requirements) will be sufficient to support our current operations, anticipated expansion\nand potential acquisitions, factors such as faster than anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in\nregulatory requirements, or additional acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are\noutside our control. If we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful, and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nGrowth through the acquisition of banks or specific bank assets or liabilities, including FDIC-assisted transactions, and de novo branching represent important\ncomponents of our business strategy. Bank acquisitions are subject to regulatory approval, and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain approval for a\nproposed acquisition in a timely manner or at all. Any future acquisitions we might make will also be accompanied by other risks commonly encountered in\nacquisitions. These risks include, among other things:\n• credit risk associated with the acquired bank’s loans and investments;\n• the use of inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n• the potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities related to the acquisition;\n• the time and expense required to integrate an acquisition;\n• the effectiveness of integrating operations, personnel and customers;\n• risks of impairment to goodwill or other than temporary impairment; and\n• potential disruption of our ongoing business.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with\nsimilar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully\nidentify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe may continue to have opportunities from time to time to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These acquisitions\ninvolve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses\nand providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. However, because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not\nallow us the time normally associated with preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These\nrisks include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems\nrelated to integration of personnel and operating systems.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions or their assets or liabilities, as opportunities arise, we may grow through de novo branching. De\nnovo branching, and any acquisition carry with them numerous risks, including the following:\n• the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n• the significant upfront costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n• the inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n• the local market receptivity for branches established or banks acquired outside of those markets in which we currently maintain a material presence;\n• the local economic conditions within the market to be served by the de novo branch or new bank;\n• the inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n• the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions (including FDIC-\nassisted transactions) and de novo branching. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and\nmaintain our market value and profitability.\nIf we acquire additional banks or bank assets in the future, there may be undiscovered risks or losses associated with such acquisitions which would have a\nnegative impact upon our future income.\nOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions of banks or bank assets. We have acquired 23 banks since we started our first subsidiary bank in 1999,\nincluding a total of 18 banks since 2010. We completed the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, headquartered in Amarillo, Texas, during the second quarter of 2022.\nWe will continue to consider future strategic acquisitions, with a primary focus on Texas, Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and other nearby markets. In most cases, our\nacquisition of a bank includes the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the target bank’s assets and liabilities, including all or a substantial portion of its loan\nportfolio, although we have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire specific lending divisions or loan portfolios. There may be instances when we, under\nour normal operating procedures, may find after the acquisition that there may be additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities\nof the target bank, and, with respect to its loan portfolio, that the ability of a borrower to repay a loan may have become impaired, the quality of the value of the\ncollateral securing a loan may fall below our standards, or our determination of the fair value of any such loan may be inadequate. One or more of these factors\nmight cause us to have additional losses or liabilities, additional loan charge-offs, or increases in our allowance for credit losses, which would have a negative\nimpact upon our financial condition and results of operations.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIf the goodwill that we may record or have recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The\namount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable\nassets acquired. At December 31, 2023, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $1.45 billion. Under current accounting standards, if we\ndetermine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired because, for example, the acquired business does not meet projected revenue targets or certain key employees\nleave, we are required to write down the carrying value of these assets. We conduct a review at least annually to determine whether goodwill is impaired. Our\nannual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2023 indicated no impairment of goodwill for our reporting segments. We cannot\nprovide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our\nshareholders’ equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nCompetition from other financial institutions and financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. We experience strong competition, not only from\ncommercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, but also from mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms,\ninsurance companies, money market funds and other financial services providers operating in or near our market areas. We compete with these institutions both in\nattracting deposits and in making loans.\nMany of our competitors are much larger national and regional financial institutions. We may face a competitive disadvantage against them as a result of our\nsmaller size and resources and our lack of geographic diversification. Due to their size, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader\nrange of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services, our business may be negatively\naffected. Many of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation that we are as an FDIC-insured institution, which gives them greater operating\nflexibility and reduces their expenses relative to ours. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in\nproviding various services.\nWe also compete against community banks that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small and mid-sized businesses\nthat we target and to use a relationship-based approach similar to ours. In addition, our competitors may seek to gain market share by pricing below the current\nmarket rates for loans and paying higher rates for deposits. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition\nfacing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological\nimprovements and innovations.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes, including the development and use of artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). Frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as\nthrough the use of digital wallets or digital currencies, are continually occurring. In addition to better serving customers, effective use of technology increases\nefficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using\ntechnology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. New\nand evolving AI use, including generative AI, may make us susceptible to uncertain risks and may require additional investment to develop responsible use\nframeworks. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement\nnew technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients, which may adversely affect our results of\noperations and future prospects.\n31\nTable of Contents\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt\nour business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause\nlosses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer\nsystems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online\nbanking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems are\nincreasingly threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic\nfraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. Our information systems have from time to time experienced such interruptions or breaches despite our\nbest efforts to prevent them. We cannot assure you that any future failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur that they will be\nadequately addressed, or that any such events that have occurred or may occur in the future will not result in material harm to our business, operations, reputation\nor profitability. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be\nrequired to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business\nactivities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach\nof, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer\nbusiness, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nAs illustrated in recent years by the impact of Hurricanes Michael, Ian and Idalia our markets in Alabama and Florida, like other coastal areas, are susceptible\nto hurricanes and tropical storms. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in\nwhich we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future unforeseen catastrophic events, including hurricanes, other\nextreme weather events and natural disasters, will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could result in a decline in loan\noriginations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties or other collateral securing our loans and an increase in the delinquencies, foreclosures and loan\nlosses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of such events.\nWe may incur environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate and\ncould become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. In addition, we acquire branches and real estate in connection with our\nacquisitions of banks. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs\nincurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical\nreleases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we were to become subject to\nsignificant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking\nlaws and regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on relationships with third party service providers. Specifically, we utilize third-party core banking services and receive\ncredit card and debit card services, branch capture services, Internet banking services and services complementary to our banking products from various third-party\nservice providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service\nproviders, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core\nbanking, credit card and debit card services, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason. If an\ninterruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n32\nTable of Contents\nOur earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk. A fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of our bank subsidiary, an employee, a vendor, or members\nof the general public. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM\ntransactions, and checking transactions. Our largest fraud risk, associated with the origination of loans, includes the intentional misstatement of information in\nproperty appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties. Compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations and our standards. There can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance\nstandards by the third parties that we deal with. Repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the holders of any debt securities that we may issue from time to time and may be subordinate to the\nholders of any series of preferred stock that may issue in the future.\nOn January 18, 2022, we issued $300.0 million of 3.125% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, which mature in 2032, and on April 1, 2022, the Company\nacquired $140.0 million of subordinated notes from Happy, which mature in 2030 and carry a fixed rate of 5.500% for the first five years. Thereafter, the notes bear\ninterest at 3-month Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) plus 5.345%, resetting quarterly. Because these subordinated notes are senior to our shares of\ncommon stock, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of any such subordinated notes then outstanding must be satisfied before any\ndistributions can be made to the holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue in the aggregate up to 5,500,000 shares of preferred stock, and to incur senior or subordinated indebtedness,\ngenerally without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights that may be superior to the rights of\nour common stock. In addition, like our outstanding subordinated debentures, any future indebtedness that we incur would be expected to be senior to our common\nstock with respect to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Accordingly, common shareholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or\nequity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock since 2003 and expect to continue this practice, we cannot assure you of our ability to\ncontinue. Our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others:\n• We may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our bank subsidiary, is subject to federal and\nstate laws that limit the ability of that bank to pay dividends.\n• Federal Reserve Board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past\nyear and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition.\n• Before dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, payments must be made on our subordinated debentures.\n• Our board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion\nof our operations, is a better strategy.\nIf we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In\naddition, in the event our bank subsidiary becomes unable, due to regulatory restrictions, capital planning needs or otherwise, to pay dividends to us, we may not be\nable to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary\ncould also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock.\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThere are currently no unresolved Commission staff comments received by the Company more than 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year covered by this\nannual report.\n33\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management\nCybersecurity is critical to supporting our business and protecting our customers in an increasingly complex environment. We face a variety of cybersecurity\nthreats including attacks that are common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, as well as attacks from advanced and highly organized\nadversaries targeting financial services companies. Our information systems have from time to time experienced such attacks despite our best efforts to prevent\nthem. Our customers, suppliers, and other third parties also face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting any party could have a\nmaterial impact on our operations, performance, or operating results. None of these threats or incidents have to date materially affected our business strategy,\nresults of operations, or financial condition. However, we cannot assure that any future security breaches will not occur or that any such events that have occurred\nor may occur in the future will not result in material harm to our business, operations, reputation or profitability. These threats and related risks highlight the\nimportance of allocating resources to protect the Company and our customers.\nThe Company maintains a formal Information Security Program that includes risk assessments regularly conducted by internal resources as well as third-party\nexperts. These assessments are used to evaluate potential security threats that may have a negative impact on the organization, detect potential vulnerabilities and\nmitigate any identified security risks. Our program leverages industry standards and frameworks and is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of our information assets and systems.\nThe Information Security Program is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), who reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer has\noversight of the Company’s risk management framework, which includes the Information Security Program. The CISO provides program oversight and direction,\nincluding adjustments in response to changes in technology, threats, business processes, and regulatory or statutory requirements. The CISO works collaboratively\nwith information technology staff, operational management, and functional stakeholders to implement a program designed to protect our information systems from\ncybersecurity threats and promptly respond to potential cybersecurity incidents. The CISO has over 24 years of experience in the fields of information technology\nand cybersecurity, most at a Fortune 500 global technology company, and maintains multiple professional cybersecurity certifications.\nOur Information Security Program consists of several elements including:\n• Incident Monitoring and Response. We have 24x7 security cybersecurity monitoring, which utilizes both third-party cybersecurity experts and leading\ntools to monitor activity in our information systems. We also maintain an incident response plan and playbooks that define our response to a cybersecurity\nincident, including a cross-functional incident response process that includes key stakeholders such as senior leaders and legal, and leverages our\ntechnological resources and third-party service providers. Through ongoing communication with these teams, the CISO monitors the prevention,\ndetection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents in real time, and reports such incidents to leadership when appropriate pursuant to\ninternal guidelines governing the reporting of such events.\n• Threat and Vulnerability Management. We maintain a threat and vulnerability management program that leverages multiple data sources to proactively\nidentify, assess, and mitigate changing cybersecurity risks. This program incorporates vulnerability scanning and threat intelligence capabilities, which are\nin place to help safeguard information assets. We also share and receive threat intelligence with government agencies, the Financial Services Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (\"FS-ISAC\") and cybersecurity vendors and leaders in the cybersecurity industry.\n• Infrastructure and Data Protection. We have technical and organizational safeguards that are designed to protect our networks, systems, and data from\ncybersecurity threats, including: firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, network and endpoint anti-malware protections, and access controls\nsuch as privileged access management. Our information security and information technology teams collaborate regularly to assess the security of current\nand future infrastructure changes.\n• Third-Party Risk Management. We run a third-party risk management program designed to identify and manage risks, including cybersecurity risks,\ninvolving our third-party providers. This includes performing due diligence and assessment of each provider’s cybersecurity posture as well as periodic re-\nassessments.\n34\nTable of Contents\n• Security Training and Awareness. We provide ongoing education and training to employees regarding cybersecurity threats and the role they play in\nhelping prevent and detect these threats. This includes regular phishing simulations, with training provided for any failures, as well as periodic\ncommunications via the internal company portal concerning threats, best practices, and technology changes to improve security. We also work with the\nCompany marketing department to periodically publish articles on our website to raise security awareness with our customers.\nWhile we maintain teams that specialize in cybersecurity and information technology, we also leverage third-party experts to provide objective feedback on\nour program and posture. These are accomplished via penetration tests, security posture assessments, and technology consulting. These independent evaluations\nhelp validate existing controls, identify potential focus areas, and aid in securely deploying technology in an increasingly complex environment.\nOur cybersecurity program is evaluated regularly by both the internal audit function as well as third-party audit firms. These audits help ensure our program is\nappropriate to address the changing threat landscape and aligns to industry standards such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity\nFramework, as well as other legal and regulatory guidance including the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Cybersecurity Assessment Tool,\nConference of State Bank Supervisors Ransomware Self-Assessment Tool, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Controls are reviewed for\nadequacy and design at least annually, and both internal and third-party audits aid in identifying areas for continued focus, providing assurance that controls are\nappropriately designed and operating effectively. Additionally, we meet regularly with examiners from the Federal Reserve and the Arkansas State Bank\nDepartment to review our cybersecurity program and discuss the changing threat landscape.\nOur cybersecurity personnel maintain current knowledge through training, obtaining professional certifications, and participation in industry groups such as\nFS-ISAC, American Bankers Association and Mid-Sized Banking Coalition of America. Company cybersecurity personnel expand and test their knowledge of\ncyber threats and countermeasures through additional on-the-job training and periodic simulated exercises to practice their response to real-life threats. We maintain\na training budget and personnel are encouraged to obtain formal training and industry-approved certifications as appropriate for their roles and responsibilities.\nSome of the certifications held by our information security personnel include CERT Insider Threat Program Manager, GIAC Information Security Professional,\nGIAC Security Leadership, GIAC Continuous Monitoring, GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst, CompTIA Security+ and ISC2 Certified Information Systems Security\nProfessional.\nBoard Oversight and Governance\nOur Board of Directors (the “Board”), in conjunction with management, is responsible for assessing which risks are warranted and acceptable, based on\nmanagement’s ability to:\n• identify and understand such risks;\n• measure the degree of exposure to such risks;\n• monitor the changing nature of the risk and related exposure; and\n• develop and implement processes and procedures to control such risks.\nThe Board and management define risk tolerances in the policies of the Company. The Board maintains oversight of risks from cybersecurity related threats,\nthrough various committees including the Audit and Risk Committee and the bank's Executive Risk Committee. The CISO reports to the Executive Risk\nCommittee. The CISO provides periodic reports to directors that permit them to measure management’s compliance with the defined risk limits and to gauge the\nchanging nature of risk inherent in the Company’s chosen lines of business and operations and as a result of changing factors within the Company, such as\nmanagement and personnel changes, and technology changes. This includes an annual program update to the Executive Risk Committee and the Board. All Board\nmembers undergo annual cybersecurity training by third-party cybersecurity experts on cybersecurity threats, industry trends, and other topics relevant to financial\ninstitutions. This training and their overall knowledge of the financial industry provides a solid foundation for understanding cyber risk and their oversight\nresponsibility.\nExecutive Risk Committee. The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”) is responsible for oversight of our bank subsidiary’s enterprise risk management\nframework and overall risk management practices and includes members of our Board, the board of directors of our bank subsidiary, and both executive and senior\nlevel management of the bank. The ERC oversees the policy review and approval program based upon the risk appetite of the Board, assists in the development and\nmonitoring of risk identification and escalation processes, ensures that ongoing monitoring is in place to identify risks that could affect the achievement of the\nCompany’s key strategic goals and objectives, and ensures that the Board has the proper information to adequately assess the risks facing the Company.\nCybersecurity reports and issues are presented at least quarterly to the ERC.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInformation Technology/Security Committee. The Information Technology/Security Committee (“ITSC”) is a management level committee that serves at the\ndirection of the Board and provides oversight of the Company’s information technology and information security programs. The members of the ITSC include\nmanagement and leaders with an expansive background in information technology and cybersecurity. The ITSC meets monthly to review information security and\ninformation technology reports and issues. It reports meeting minutes to the Board and ensures the Board has the proper information to adequately assess the risks\nfacing the Company by maintaining oversight of:\n• effective strategic information technology and information security planning and performance;\n• major projects, priorities, and overall performance;\n• the adequacy and allocation of resources; and\n• the risks involved with the information technology and information security functions.\nItem 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company’s main office is located in a Company-owned 33,000 square foot building located at 719 Harkrider Street in downtown Conway, Arkansas. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, our bank subsidiary owned or leased a total of 76 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, 63 branches in Texas, five branches in\nAlabama and one branch in New York City. The Company also owns or leases other buildings that provide space for operations, mortgage lending and other\ngeneral purposes. We believe that our banking and other offices are in good condition and are suitable to our needs.\nItem 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWhile we and our bank subsidiary and other affiliates are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of their business,\nmanagement believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that there are no proceedings threatened or pending against us or our bank subsidiary or other affiliates\nthat will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial condition.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HOMB.” As of February 16, 2024, there were approximately 1,626\nstockholders of record of the Company’s common stock.\nOur policy is to declare regular quarterly dividends based upon our earnings, financial position, capital improvements and such other factors deemed relevant\nby the Board of Directors. We currently expect to continue declaring and paying quarterly cash dividends comparable to our historical quarterly dividend payments.\nOur dividend policy is subject to change, however, and the payment of dividends is not necessarily dependent upon the availability of earnings and future financial\ncondition. Information regarding regulatory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends is discussed in “Supervision and Regulation – Payment of Dividends.”\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a portion of its stock repurchase program most recently amended and approved by\nthe Board of Directors on January 22, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021. This discussion should be read together with the “Summary Consolidated Financial Data,” our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and\nother financial data included in this document. In addition to the historical information provided below, we have made certain estimates and forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking\nstatements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the section of this document captioned “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this document. Unless\nthe context requires otherwise, the terms “Company,” “HBI,” “us,” “we” and “our” refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis.\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned bank subsidiary,\nCentennial Bank (“Centennial”). As of December 31, 2023, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $22.66 billion, loans receivable, net, of $14.14 billion,\ntotal deposits of $16.79 billion, and stockholders’ equity of $3.79 billion.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and FHLB borrowed funds\nare our primary source of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment.\nWe measure our performance by calculating our net interest margin, return on average assets and return on average common equity. We also measure our\nperformance by our efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP). The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less\namortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a\nmeaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit\nintangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain items such as merger expenses, hurricane\nexpenses and/or gains and losses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\nAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal assets $ 22,656,658 $ 22,883,588 $ 18,052,138\nLoans receivable 14,424,728 14,409,480 9,836,089\nAllowance for credit losses (288,234) (289,669) (236,714)\nTotal deposits 16,787,711 17,938,783 14,260,570\nTotal stockholders’ equity 3,791,075 3,526,362 2,765,721\nNet income 392,929 305,262 319,021\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.94 $ 1.57 $ 1.94\nDiluted earnings per share 1.94 1.57 1.94\nBook value per share 18.81 17.33 16.90\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP)(1) 11.63 10.17 10.80\nNet interest margin(2) 4.25 % 3.81 % 3.66 %\nEfficiency ratio 46.21 49.53 40.81\nEfficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP)(3) 45.24 44.55 42.12\nReturn on average assets 1.77 1.35 1.83\nReturn on average common equity 10.82 9.17 11.89\n(1) See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n(2) Fully taxable equivalent (assuming an income tax rate of 25.740% for 2021, 24.6735% for 2022 and 24.989% for 2023).\n(3) See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n40\nTable of Contents\n2023 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur net income increased $87.7 million, or 28.7%, to $392.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $305.3 million for the same period in 2022.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.94 per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1.57 per share for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company recorded $12.1 million in credit loss expense for the year ended December 31, 2023. This consisted of a $12.0 million provision\nfor credit losses on loans, a $1.7 million provision for credit losses on investment securities and a reversal of $1.5 million provision for unfunded commitments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $13.0 million in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") special assessment expense\nand $1.1 million loss for the decrease in fair value of marketable securities, which were partially offset by $3.5 million in recoveries on historic losses from loans\ncharged off prior to acquisition and $3.1 million in bank owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") death benefits.\nTotal interest income increased by $297.3 million, or 33.9%, and non-interest expense decreased by $2.8 million, or 0.6%. This was partially offset by a $229.0\nmillion, or 192.3%, increase in interest expense and a $5.2 million, or 3.0%, decrease in non-interest income. The increase in interest income resulted from a\n$261.3 million, or 35.9%, increase in loan interest income and a $49.9 million, or 41.5%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $14.1 million, or\n48.4%, decrease in interest income on deposits at other banks. The decrease in non-interest expense was due to a $49.6 million, or 100.0%, decrease in merger and\nacquisition expense partially offset by a $20.5 million, or 20.7%, increase in other operating expenses, an $18.1 million, or 7.6%, increase in salaries and employee\nbenefits, a $6.9 million, or 12.9%, increase in occupancy and equipment and a $1.4 million, or 4.0%, increase in data processing expense. Included within other\noperating expense was $13.0 million in FDIC special assessment expense which was levied in order to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated\nwith protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a\n$210.0 million, or 244.2%, increase in interest on deposits, a $19.7 million, or 178.3%, increase in interest on FHLB and other borrowed funds and a $3.4 million,\nor 236.6%, increase in interest on securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which were partially offset by a $4.1 million, or 19.9%, decrease in interest on\nsubordinated debentures. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a $9.8 million, or 20.3%, decrease in other income and a $6.9 million, or 39.2%,\ndecrease in mortgage lending income, which were partially offset by a $5.0 million, or 39.2%, increase in trust fees, a $2.4 million, or 26.6%, increase in dividends\nfrom FHLB, FRB, FNBB & other, a $2.1 million, or 5.6%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and a $1.5 million, or 9,946.7%, increase in gain on\nbranches, equipment and other assets, net.\nOur net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from 3.81% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 4.25% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.03% and 4.40% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as average interest\nearning assets decreased from $20.15 billion to $19.57 billion. The decrease in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a $2.12 billion decrease in average\ninterest-bearing balances due from banks, which was partially offset by a $1.37 billion increase in average loans receivable and a $171.0 million increase in\naverage investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $10.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in total net accretion\nfor acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points. The overall increase in the net\ninterest margin was due to a decrease in average interest-bearing cash balances as well as an increase in interest income from higher yields on average interest-\nearning assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities at higher interest rates primarily as a result\nof the Happy Bancshares, Inc. acquisition and the increased interest rate environment.\nOur efficiency ratio was 46.21% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 49.53% for the same period in 2022. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 45.24%, compared to 44.55% reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. (See Table 29 for the non-\nGAAP tabular reconciliation).\nOur return on average assets was 1.77% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1.35% for the same period in 2022, and our return on average\nassets, as adjusted (non-GAAP) was 1.79% or the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1.67% for the same period in 2022. Our return on average common\nequity was 10.82% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 9.17% for the same period in 2022.\n41\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2023 decreased $226.9 million to $22.66 billion from the $22.88 billion reported as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in\ntotal assets is primarily due to a $539.5 million decrease in investment securities resulting from paydowns and maturities, which was partially offset by a $275.4\nmillion increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year. Our loan portfolio balance increased $15.2 million to $14.42 billion as of December 31, 2023, from\n$14.41 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in loans was due to $340.4 million in organic loan growth within our legacy footprint, which was partially\noffset by $325.2 million of organic loan decline from our Centennial Commercial Finance Group (\"CFG\") franchise during 2023. Total deposits decreased\n$1.15 billion to $16.79 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $17.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to the\nrunoff of deposits during 2023 as a result of the rising interest rate environment. Stockholders’ equity increased $264.7 million to $3.79 billion as of December 31,\n2023, compared to $3.53 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in stockholders’ equity is primarily associated with the $392.9 million in net income and\nthe $56.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $145.9 million of shareholder dividends paid and the\nrepurchase of $48.3 million of our common stock during 2023. The improvement in stockholders’ equity was 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our non-performing loans increased to $64.1 million, or 0.44%, of total loans from $60.9 million, or 0.42%, of total loans as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans decreased to 449.66% as of December 31, 2023, compared to\n475.99% as of December 31, 2022.

The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had\naccrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance. In\naddition, the $22.8 million balance of foreclosed assets held for sale for our Centennial CFG Property Finance Group consists of an office building located in\nCalifornia which was placed in foreclosed assets held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2023. This represents the largest component of the Company's $30.5\nmillion in foreclosed assets held for sale.\n42\nTable of Contents\n2022 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nOur net income decreased $13.8 million, or 4.3%, to $305.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $319.0 million for the same period in 2021.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.57 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $1.94 per share for the year ended December\n31, 2021. As a result of the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc. (\"Happy\"), which we completed on April 1, 2022, we incurred $49.6 million in merger expenses\nand recorded a $45.2 million provision for credit losses on acquired loans for the CECL \"double count,\" an $11.4 million provision for credit losses on acquired\nunfunded commitments and a $2.0 million provision for credit losses on acquired held-to-maturity investment securities. The summation of these items reduced net\nincome by $81.6 million ($108.2 million pre-tax) and earnings per share by $0.42 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of the\nacquisition of Happy, the Company determined that an additional $5.0 million provision for credit losses on loans was necessary due to increased loan growth\nduring the year. However, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Happy, the Company determined no additional provision for unfunded commitments or\ninvestment securities was necessary as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $10.0 million in income from the\nsettlement of a lawsuit brought by the Company, net of legal expense, $6.7 million in recoveries on historic losses from loans charged off prior to acquisition, and\n$1.4 million in special dividends from equity investments, which were partially offset by $2.1 million in trust preferred securities (\"TRUPS\") redemption fees, $1.3\nmillion of loss for the decrease in fair value of marketable securities and $176,000 in hurricane expenses.\nTotal interest income increased by $252.6 million, or 40.4%, and non-interest income increased by $37.5 million, or 27.3%. This was partially offset by a\n$177.1 million, or 59.3%, increase in non-interest expense and a $66.9 million, or 128.1%, increase in interest expense. These fluctuations are primarily due to the\nacquisition of Happy during the second quarter of 2022 and the rising rate environment. The increase in interest income resulted from a $156.4 million, or 27.3%,\nincrease in loan interest income, a $70.6 million, or 142.0%, increase in investment income and a $25.6 million, or 728.2%, increase in interest income on deposits\nat other banks. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $27.6 million, or 133.2%, increase in other income, a $14.8 million, or 66.6%, increase\nin service charges on deposit accounts, a $10.9 million, or 555.9%, increase in trust fees, an $8.1 million, or 22.3%, increase in other service charges and fees and a\n$1.8 million, or 85.5%, increase in the cash value of life insurance. These increases were partially offset by an $8.5 million, or 117.7%, decrease in income for the\nfair value adjustment for marketable securities resulting from a $1.3 million decrease in the fair value of marketable securities for the year ended December 31,\n2022, compared to a $7.2 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, an $8.0 million, or 31.2%, decrease in mortgage lending income, a $5.6 million,\nor 38.0%, decrease in dividends from FHLB, FRB, FNBB and other, a $2.2 million, or 92.3%, decrease in the gain on sale of SBA loans and a $1.5 million, or\n75.0%, decrease in gain on other real estate owned (\"OREO\"). Included within other income was $15.0 million in income from the settlement of a lawsuit brought\nby the Company and $6.7 million in recoveries on historic losses from loans charged off prior to acquisition, and included within dividends from FHLB, FRB,\nFNBB and other were $1.4 million in special dividends. The increase in non-interest expense was due to a $68.1 million, or 39.9%, increase in salaries and\nemployee benefits, $49.6 million in merger and acquisition expenses, a $33.8 million, or 52.1%, increase in other operating expenses, a $16.8 million, or 45.8%,\nincrease in occupancy and equipment and a $10.7 million, or 43.9%, increase in data processing expense. Included within other operating expense were $5.0\nmillion in legal expenses from a lawsuit brought by the Company, $2.1 million in TRUPS redemption fees and $176,000 in hurricane expenses. The increase in\ninterest expense was primarily due to a $61.1 million, or 244.8%, increase in interest on deposits, a $3.5 million, or 45.7%, increase in interest on FHLB and other\nborrowed funds and a $1.4 million, or 7.5%, increase in interest on subordinated debentures as a result of the acquisition of $140.0 million of subordinated debt and\n$23.2 million in trust preferred securities from Happy during the second quarter of 2022. Income tax expense decreased by $8.4 million, or 8.6%, during 2022 due\nto the decrease in net income and the reduction in the marginal tax rate related to the Happy acquisition.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOur net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from 3.66% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.81% for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.40% and 3.99% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as average interest earning\nassets increased from $15.86 billion to $20.15 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $2.57 billion increase in average loans\nreceivable and a $1.87 billion increase in average investment securities, largely resulting from the acquisition of Happy, which were partially offset by a $151.9\nmillion decrease in average interest-bearing balances due from banks. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $16.3 million and $20.2\nmillion, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 2\nbasis points. During 2022, the Company experienced a $31.8 million reduction in interest income from PPP loans due to the forgiveness of the PPP loans and the\nacceleration of the deferred fees for the loans that were forgiven. This reduction in income was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 8 basis points.\nWe recognized $3.8 million in event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $6.7 million in event income for the year ended December\n31, 2021. This was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. The overall increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in\ninterest income due to an increase in both average earning assets at higher yields, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in\naverage interest-bearing liabilities at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the Happy acquisition and the current rising interest rate environment.\nOur efficiency ratio was 49.53% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 40.81% for the same period in 2021.

The increase in\ntotal assets is primarily due to the acquisition of $6.69 billion in total assets, net of purchase accounting adjustments, from Happy during the second quarter of\n2022. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.93 billion, or 80.14%. Our loan portfolio balance increased $4.57 billion to $14.41 billion as of December 31, 2022,\nfrom $9.84 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in loans was due to the acquisition of $3.65 billion in loans, net of purchase accounting adjustments,\nfrom Happy in the second quarter of 2022 and $242.2 million in marine loans from LendingClub Bank during the first quarter of 2022, as well as $678.6 million in\norganic loan growth during 2022. Total deposits increased $3.68 billion to $17.94 billion as of December 31, 2022 compared to $14.26 billion as of December 31,\n2021. The increase in deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of $5.86 billion in deposits, net of purchase accounting adjustments, from Happy in the second\nquarter of 2022, partially offset by $2.18 billion in deposit decline during the year. Stockholders’ equity increased $760.6 million to $3.53 billion as of December\n31, 2022, compared to $2.77 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in stockholders’ equity is primarily associated with the $961.3 million in common stock\nissued to Happy shareholders for the acquisition of Happy on April 1, 2022 and $305.3 million in net income, which were partially offset by the $315.9 million\ndecrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, $128.4 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $70.9 million of our common stock\nduring 2022.

Due to the condition of the two loans, partial charge-offs\nfor a total of $5.4 million were taken on these loans during 2022. The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had\naccrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOverview. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and\ncustomary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are\ndescribed in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate;\nand (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur\nfrom period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are\nthose associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income\ntaxes and stock options.\nRevenue Recognition. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes\nprinciples for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods\nor services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The\nmajority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters\nof credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures.\nDescriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-\ninterest income are as follows:\n• Service charges on deposit accounts – These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and\nconsist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue\nis recognized when our performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been\ncompleted (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.\n• Other service charges and fees – These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial CFG loan fees. The interchange fees are recorded in the\nperiod the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts. Centennial CFG loan fees are based on\nloan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310. Interchange fees were $22.6 million and $22.1 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Centennial CFG loan fees were $9.9 million and $11.8 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n• Trust fees - The Company enters into contracts with its customers to manage assets for investment, and/or transact on their accounts. The Company\ngenerally satisfies its performance obligations as services are rendered. The management fees are percentage based, flat, percentage of income or a fixed\npercentage calculated upon the average balance of assets depending upon account type. Fees are collected on a monthly or annual basis.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCredit Losses. We account for credit losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326\" or \"CECL\"). The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial\nassets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not\naccounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases\nrecognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases.\nInvestments – Available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale (\"AFS\") are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our\nasset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory\ncapital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position\nrequire a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company\nwill be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s\namortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair\nvalue has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost,\nand changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment\nindicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security.\nIf the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for\nthe credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for\ncredit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the\nestimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as\nprovision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is\nconfirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nInvestments – Held-to-Maturity. Debt securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold\nuntil maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to\nthe call date to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to\ndetermine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company measures expected credit losses on\nHTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers\nhistorical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude\naccrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes\nin the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of a security is confirmed.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at\ntheir outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management’s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff,\nexcept for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed\nand expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments\nto historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,\ndelinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, rental\nvacancy rate, housing price indices and rental vacancy rate index.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan\nsegments are as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupies commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - SPF\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method (\"DCF\"). Loans evaluated individually that\nare considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of\nestimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral,\nexpected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the\noperation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of\nthe loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the\nloss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n• Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be\nexecuted with an individual borrower.\n• The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by\nthe Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing\nthe expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors (\"Q-Factors\") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's\nestimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making\nQ-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in\nnature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration\nrisk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan\nreview system and (ix) economic conditions.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower’s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business\nconditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the\nallowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally\ncharged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-\naccrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at\nleast six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\n47\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the\nacquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326,\nthe Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair\nvalue methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to\nexpected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated\n(“PCD”) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for\ncredit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its\ninitial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is\namortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures: The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the\nCompany is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance\nfor credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that\nfunding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale. Real estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at\nfair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties\nare carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and\nexpenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net\nassets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined\nby valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 months to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but\nrather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB\nASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting\nguidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current\nperiod by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using\nthe liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and\ntax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely\nthan not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of\nmore than 50 percent; the terms “examined” and “upon examination” also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that\nmeets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax\nposition has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to\nthe management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that\nsome portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts\ndetermined to be currently payable.\nStock Compensation. In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-\nEmployees, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option\naward over the vesting period of the award.\n48\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc., and merged Happy State Bank into Centennial Bank. The Company\nissued approximately 42.4 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately $958.8 million as of April 1, 2022. In addition, the holders of certain Happy\nstock-based awards received approximately $3.7 million in cash in cancellation of such awards, for a total transaction value of approximately $962.5 million. The\nacquisition added new markets for expansion and brought complementary businesses together to drive synergies and growth.\nIncluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, Happy had approximately $6.69 billion in total assets, $3.65 billion in\nloans and $5.86 billion in customer deposits. Happy formerly operated its banking business from 62 locations in Texas.\nFor further discussion of the acquisition, see Note 2 \"Business Combinations\" to the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Marine Portfolio\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company completed the purchase of the performing marine loan portfolio of Utah-based LendingClub Bank (“LendingClub”). Under\nthe terms of the purchase agreement with LendingClub, the Company acquired yacht loans totaling approximately $242.2 million. This portfolio of loans is housed\nwithin the Company's Shore Premier Finance division, which is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production.\nWe will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions, which may include FDIC-assisted acquisitions as opportunities arise, to determine what is\nin the best interest of our Company. Our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors.\nBranches\nAs opportunities arise, we will continue to open new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 223 branch locations. There were 76 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, 63 branches in Texas, five branches in\nAlabama and one branch in New York City.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nOur net income increased $87.7 million, or 28.7%, to $392.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $305.3 million for the same period in 2022.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.94 per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1.57 per share for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company recorded $12.1 million in credit loss expense for the year ended December 31, 2023. This consisted of a $12.0 million provision\nfor credit losses on loans, a $1.7 million provision for credit losses on investment securities and a reversal of $1.5 million provision for unfunded commitments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $13.0 million in FDIC special assessment expense and $1.1 million loss for the decrease in fair\nvalue of marketable securities, which were partially offset by $3.5 million in recoveries on historic losses from loans charged off prior to acquisition and $3.1\nmillion in BOLI death benefits.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOur net income decreased $13.8 million, or 4.3%, to $305.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $319.0 million for the same period in 2021.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.57 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $1.94 per share for the year ended December\n31, 2021. As a result of the acquisition of Happy, which we completed on April 1, 2022, we incurred $49.6 million in merger expenses and recorded a $45.2 million\nprovision for credit losses on acquired loans for the CECL \"double count,\" an $11.4 million provision for credit losses on acquired unfunded commitments and a\n$2.0 million provision for credit losses on acquired held-to-maturity investment securities. The summation of these items reduced net income by $81.6 million\n($108.2 million pre-tax) and earnings per share by $0.42 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Happy, the\nCompany determined that an additional $5.0 million provision for credit losses on loans was necessary due to increased loan growth during the year. However,\nexcluding the impact of the acquisition of Happy, the Company determined no additional provision for unfunded commitments or investment securities was\nnecessary as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $10.0 million in income from the settlement of a lawsuit\nbrought by the Company, net of legal expense, $6.7 million in recoveries on historic losses from loans charged off prior to acquisition, and $1.4 million in special\ndividends from equity investments, which were partially offset by $2.1 million in TRUPS redemption fees, $1.3 million loss for the decrease in fair value of\nmarketable securities and $176,000 in hurricane expenses.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the\ndeposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-\ninterest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The\nadjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state\nincome tax rate (24.989% for the year ended December 31, 2023, 24.6735% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 25.740% for year ended December 31,\n2021).\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest,\nincluding the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate seven times during 2022. First, on March 16,\n2022, the target rate was increased to 0.25% to 0.50%. Second, on May 4, 2022, the target rate was increased to 0.75% to 1.00%. Third, on June 15, 2022, the target\nrate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75%. Fourth, on July 27, 2022, the target rate was increased to 2.25% to 2.50%. Fifth, on September 21, 2022, the target rate was\nincreased to 3.00% to 3.25%. Sixth, on November 2, 2022, the target rate was increased to 3.75% to 4.00%. Seventh, on December 14, 2022, the target rate was\nincreased to 4.25% to 4.50%. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate four times during 2023. First, on February 1, 2023, the target rate was increased to\n4.50% to 4.75%, second, on March 22, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.75% to 5.00%, third, on May 3, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.00% to\n5.25% and fourth, on July 26, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.25% to 5.50%.\nOur net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from 3.81% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 4.25% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.03% and 4.40% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as average interest\nearning assets decreased from $20.15 billion to $19.57 billion. The decrease in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a $2.12 billion decrease in average\ninterest-bearing balances due from banks, which was partially offset by a $1.37 billion increase in average loans receivable and a $171.0 million increase in\naverage investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $10.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively, in total net accretion\nfor acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points. The overall increase in the net\ninterest margin was due to a decrease in average interest-bearing cash balances as well as an increase in interest income from higher yields on average interest-\nearning assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities at higher interest rates primarily as a result\nof the Happy acquisition and the current rising interest rate environment.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $65.1 million, or 8.5%, to $832.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $767.3\nmillion for the same period in 2022. This increase in net interest income was the result of a $294.1 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $229.0\nmillion increase in interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The $294.1 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the increasing\ninterest rate environment and the higher level of average interest earning assets due to the acquisition of Happy during the second quarter of 2022. The higher yield\non earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $248.5 million, and the change in earning assets resulted in an increase in interest\nincome of approximately $45.6 million. The $229.0 million increase in interest expense is primarily the result of the increasing interest rate environment as well as\nthe higher level of average interest bearing liabilities due to the acquisition of Happy during the second quarter of 2022. The higher rates on interest bearing\nliabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $224.1 million, and the change in interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest\nexpense of approximately $4.9 million.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOur net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased from 3.66% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.81% for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.40% and 3.99% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as average interest earning\nassets increased from $15.86 billion to $20.15 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $2.57 billion increase in average loans\nreceivable and a $1.87 billion increase in average investment securities, largely resulting from the acquisition of Happy, which were partially offset by a $151.9\nmillion decrease in average interest-bearing balances due from banks. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $16.3 million and $20.2\nmillion, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 2\nbasis points. During 2022, the Company experienced a $31.8 million reduction in interest income from PPP loans due to the forgiveness of the PPP loans and the\nacceleration of the deferred fees for the loans that were forgiven. This reduction in income was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 8 basis points.\nWe recognized $3.8 million in event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $6.7 million in event income for the year ended December\n31, 2021. This was dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. The overall increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in\ninterest income due to an increase in both average earning assets at higher yields, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in\naverage interest-bearing liabilities at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the Happy acquisition, and the current rising interest rate environment.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $187.3 million, or 32.3%, to $767.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from\n$580.1 million for the same period in 2021. This increase in net interest income was the result of a $254.2 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a\n$66.9 million increase in interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The $254.2 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the higher\nlevel of average interest earnings assets due to the acquisition of Happy during the second quarter of 2022 and the increasing interest rate environment. The\nincrease in earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $185.5 million, and the higher yield on earning assets resulted in a decrease in\ninterest income of approximately $68.7 million. The $66.9 million increase in interest expense was primarily the result of the higher level of average interest\nbearing liabilities due to the acquisition of Happy during the second quarter of 2022 and the increasing interest rate environment. The higher rates on interest\nbearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $52.8 million, and the increase in interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in\ninterest expense of approximately $14.0 million.\nTables 2 and 3 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, as well as\nchanges in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the years 2023 compared to 2022 and 2022 compared to 2021.\nTable 2: Analysis of Net Interest Income\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 1,175,053 $ 877,766 $ 625,171\nFully taxable equivalent adjustment 5,506 8,663 7,079\nInterest income – fully taxable equivalent 1,180,559 886,429 632,250\nInterest expense 348,108 119,090 52,200\nNet interest income – fully taxable equivalent $ 832,451 $ 767,339 $ 580,050\nYield on earning assets – fully taxable equivalent 6.03 % 4.40 % 3.99 %\nCost of interest-bearing liabilities 2.52 0.87 0.49\nNet interest spread – fully taxable equivalent 3.51 3.53 3.50\nNet interest margin – fully taxable equivalent 4.25 3.81 3.66\n51\nTable of Contents\nTable 3: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\nDecember 31,\n2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n(In thousands)\nIncrease in interest income due to change in earning assets $ 45,599 $ 185,499\nIncrease in interest income due to change in earning asset yields 248,531 68,680\nIncrease in interest expense due to change in interest-bearing liabilities (4,945) (14,048)\nIncrease in interest expense due to change in interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities (224,073) (52,842)\nIncrease in net interest income $ 65,112 $ 187,289\nTable 4 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amount outstanding, the interest income or expense on that\namount and the average rate earned or expensed for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable\nto financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures\nnot accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases\nrecognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases.\nCredit Loss Expense: During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $12.0 million provision for credit losses on loans, a $1.7 million\nprovision for credit losses on investment securities and a recovery of $1.5 million provision for unfunded commitments.\nNet charge-offs to average total loans decreased to 0.09% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 0.11% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-\nperforming loans to total loans increased from 0.42% as of December 31, 2022 to 0.44% as of December 31, 2023.\nLoans. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments\nto historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,\ndelinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, national\nretail sales index, housing price indices and rental vacancy rate index.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAcquired loans. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. This is commonly\nreferred to as “double accounting\" or \"double count.\"\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments\nare as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupies commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - SPF\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans evaluated individually that are\nconsidered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of\nestimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral,\nexpected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the\noperation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of\nthe loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the\nloss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nInvestments – Available-for-sale: The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit\nlosses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is\nwritten down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from\ncredit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating\nof the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss\nexists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of\ncash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited\nby the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of\ncredit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or\nreversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either\nof the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nInvestments – Held-to-Maturity. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit\nlosses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type\nsharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit\nlosses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal\nof) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed.\n54\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, one of the Company’s AFS subordinated debt investment securities was downgraded below investment grade. As\nresult, the Company wrote down the value of the investment to its unrealized loss position, which required a $1.7 million provision. The remaining $842,000\nallowance for credit losses on AFS investments is associated with certain securities in the subordinated debt portfolio within the banking sector. These investments\nare classified within the other securities category of the AFS portfolio. The $2.0 million allowance for credit losses for the held-to-maturity portfolio was\nconsidered adequate. No additional provision for credit losses was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income was $169.9 million in 2023, compared to $175.1 million in 2022 and $137.6 million in 2021.

The primary factors that resulted in this decrease were the $9.8 million decrease in other income and the $6.9 million decrease in mortgage lending income,\npartially offset by the $5.0 million increase in trust fees. Other factors were changes related to service charges on deposit accounts, cash value of life insurance,\ndividends from FHLB, FRB, FNBB & other and gain on sale of branches, equipment and other assets.\nAdditional details for the year ended December 31, 2023 on some of the more significant changes are as follows:\n• The $2.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts is primarily related to an increase in overdraft fees and service charge fees\nrelated to the acquisition of Happy.\n• The $5.0 million increase in trust fees is primarily related to an increase in trust fees resulting from the acquisition of Happy.\n• The $6.9 million decrease in mortgage lending income is primarily related to a decrease in volume of secondary market loans from the high\nvolume of loans during 2022. The decrease in volume is due to the increase in interest rates.\n55\nTable of Contents\n• The $855,000 increase in cash value of life insurance is primarily related to the increase in bank owned life insurance resulting from the\nacquisition of Happy.\n• The $2.4 million increase in dividends from FHLB, FRB, FNBB & other is primarily due to an increase in dividend income from FHLB and FRB\nstock holdings related to the acquisition of Happy and an increase in dividends on marketable securities, partially offset by a lower volume of\ndividends from equity investments.\n• The $1.5 million increase in gain on sale of branches, equipment and other assets, net, is primarily due to the sales of buildings in Texas and\nFlorida in 2023.\n• The $9.8 million decrease in other income is primarily due to the $15.0 million in income in 2022 from the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the\nCompany and a $6.0 million decrease in income for items previously charged-off, which were partially offset by $4.9 million increase in income\nfrom equity method investments, $3.1 million in BOLI death benefit income and a $2.8 million increase in rental income primarily related to the\nacquisition of Happy.\nNon-interest income increased $37.5 million, or 27.3%, to $175.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $137.6 million for the same period in\n2021.

Our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as “special mention” or otherwise classified\nor on non-accrual status.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is\ndetermined using the same methodology as other loans. For PCD loans not individually analyzed for impairment, the Company develops separate PCD models for\neach loan segment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and\nallowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-\ncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded\nthrough the provision for credit losses. The Company held approximately $130.7 million and $142.5 million in PCD loans, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nTable 10 sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of these dates, all non-performing restructured\nloans are included in non-accrual loans.\nTable 10: Non-performing Assets\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans $ 59,971 $ 51,011\nLoans past due 90 days or more (principal or interest payments) 4,130 9,845\nTotal non-performing loans 64,101 60,856\nOther non-performing assets\nForeclosed assets held for sale, net 30,486 546\nOther non-performing assets 785 74\nTotal other non-performing assets 31,271 620\nTotal non-performing assets $ 95,372 $ 61,476\nAllowance for credit losses to non-accrual loans 480.62 % 567.86 %\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 449.66 475.99\nNon-accrual loans to total loans 0.42 0.35\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.44 0.42\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.42 0.27\nOur non-performing loans are comprised of non-accrual loans and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days. Our bank subsidiary recognizes\nincome principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as non-accrual, the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is\naccrued, unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be\nuncollectible is then charged to the allowance for credit losses.\nTotal non-performing loans were $64.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $60.9 million as of December 31, 2022, for an increase of $3.2 million.\nThe $3.2 million increase in non-performing loans is primarily the result of increases in non-performing loans in our Texas, Arkansas, SPF and Alabama markets of\n$11.3 million, $7.0 million, $452,000 and $9,000, respectively, which were partially offset by decreases in non-performing loans in our Florida and Centennial\nCFG markets of $11.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2023, were $15.4 million, $9.3 million, $33.5 million,\n$413,000, $2.8 million and $2.7 million in the Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets, respectively.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe $2.7 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG Capital Markets Group consists of two loans that are assessed for credit risk by the\nFederal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had\naccrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance. In\naddition, the $22.8 million balance of foreclosed assets held for sale for our Centennial CFG Property Finance Group consists of an office building located in\nCalifornia which was placed in foreclosed assets held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2023. This represents the largest component of the Company's $30.5\nmillion in foreclosed assets held for sale.\nDebt restructuring generally occurs when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term. As a result, we will\nwork with the borrower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. In those circumstances it may be beneficial\nto restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it\nin an unfavorable and depressed real estate market. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually either reduce the monthly payment and/or interest rate\nfor generally about three to twelve months. For our restructured loans that accrue interest at the time the loan is restructured, it would be a rare exception to have\ncharged-off any portion of the loan. As of December 31, 2023, we had $22.7 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are\nnot reported as past due or non-accrual. Our Florida market contains $17.4 million, our Arkansas market contains $1.7 million, our Texas market contains $1.4\nmillion and our New York region contains $2.2 million of these restructured loans.\nA loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted. These loans can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual,\nor continuing on an accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a non-accrual loan that is restructured remains\non non-accrual for a period of nine months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or\nsignificant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay under the new terms and may result in the loan\nbeing returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the\nloan will remain in a non-accrual status.\nThe majority of the Bank’s restructured loans relate to real estate lending and generally involve reducing the interest rate, changing from a principal and\ninterest payment to interest-only, lengthening the amortization period, or a combination of some or all of the three. In addition, it is common for the Bank to seek\nadditional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan. At December 31, 2023, the amount of restructured loans was $24.6 million. As of December 31,\n2023, 92.1% of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure.\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale were $30.5 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $546,000 as of December 31, 2022 for a increase of\n$29.9 million. The foreclosed assets held for sale as of December 31, 2023 are comprised of approximately $167,000 of assets located in Arkansas, $7.3 million of\nassets located in Florida, zero located in Alabama, $22.8 million of assets in our Centennial CFG market and $264,000 located in Texas. The increase in total\nforeclosed assets held for sale was primarily due to the addition of two properties during 2023. The first is an office building located in Santa Monica, California\nwith a carrying value of $22.8 million, and the second is an office building located in Miami, Florida with a carrying value of $7.0 million. These two properties\naccount for $29.8 million of the balance of foreclosed assets held for sale at December 31, 2023.\nTable 11 shows the summary of foreclosed assets held for sale as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 11: Total Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale\nDecember 31\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 29,894 $ 118\nConstruction/land development 47 47\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 545 260\nMultifamily residential — 121\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale $ 30,486 $ 546\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe Company had $94.9 million and $221.1 million in impaired loans (which includes loans individually analyzed for credit losses for which a specific reserve\nhas been recorded, non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net\namount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is\nconfirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nThe Company uses the DCF method to estimate expected losses for all of Company’s loan pools. These pools are as follows: construction & land development;\nother commercial real estate; residential real estate; commercial & industrial; and consumer & other. The loan portfolio pools were selected in order to generally\nalign with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. For each of\nthese loan pools, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speed,\ncurtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates, and time to recovery\nare based on historical internal data. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when\nmodeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react\nto forecasted levels of the loss drivers.\nFor all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate\nover four quarters on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver\nforecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when developing\nthe forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments\nto historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,\ndelinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, national\nretail sales index, housing price indices and rental vacancy rate index.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments\nare as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupies commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - SPF\nThe combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and time expectations prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery) produces an\nexpected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument\nexpected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present value of expected cash flows (“NPV”). An allowance for\ncredit loss is established for the difference between the instrument’s NPV and amortized cost basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans evaluated individually that are\nconsidered to be impaired are not included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the\ndiscounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. For loans for which a specific\nreserve is not recorded, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation if a specific reserve is not recorded.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n• Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be\nexecuted with an individual borrower.\n• The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by\nthe Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing\nthe expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected\ncredit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other\nqualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of\nthe portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in\nunderlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system and\n(ix) economic conditions.\nLoans considered to be collateral dependent, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be\nunable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of collateral shortfall on such loans is utilized in\nevaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on collateral dependent loans are charged against the allowance\nfor credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on collateral dependent loans is\ndiscontinued when, in management’s opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is\ndiscontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal\ndue. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably\nassured.\n67\nTable of Contents\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower’s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business\nconditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the\nallowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally\ncharged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-\naccrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at\nleast six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of\nthe acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC\n326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with\nthe fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates\nrelated to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is\ndetermined using the same methodology as other loans. For PCD loans not individually analyzed for impairment, the Company develops separate PCD models for\neach loan segment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and\nallowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-\ncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded\nthrough the provision for credit losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the\nCompany is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance\nfor credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that\nfunding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nSpecific Allocations. As a general rule, if a specific allocation is warranted, it is the result of a credit loss analysis of a previously classified credit or\nrelationship. Typically, when it becomes evident through the payment history or a financial statement review that a loan or relationship is no longer supported by\nthe cash flows of the asset and/or borrower and has become collateral dependent, we will use appraisals or other collateral analysis to determine if a specific\nallocation is needed. The amount or likelihood of loss on this credit may not yet be evident, so a charge-off would not be prudent. However, if the analysis indicates\nthat a specific allocation is needed, then a specific allocation will be determined for this loan. This analysis is performed each quarter in connection with the\npreparation of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and if necessary, adjustments are made to the specific allocation provided for a\nparticular loan..\nFor collateral dependent loans, we do not consider an appraisal outdated simply due to the passage of time. However, if an appraisal is older than 13 months\nand if market or other conditions have deteriorated and we believe that the current market value of the property is not within approximately 20% of the appraised\nvalue, we will consider the appraisal outdated and order either a new appraisal or an internal valuation report for the credit loss analysis. The recognition of any\nprovision or related charge-off on a collateral dependent loan is either through annual credit analysis or, many times, when the relationship becomes delinquent. If\nthe borrower is not current, we will update our credit and cash flow analysis to determine the borrower's repayment ability. If we determine this ability does not\nexist and it appears that the collection of the entire principal and interest is not likely, then the loan could be placed on non-accrual status. In any case, loans are\nclassified as non-accrual no later than 105 days past due. If the loan requires a quarterly credit loss analysis, this analysis is completed in conjunction with the\ncompletion of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Any exposure identified through the credit loss analysis is shown as a specific reserve.\nIf it is determined that a new appraisal or internal validation report is required, it is ordered and will be taken into consideration during completion of the next credit\nloss analysis.\nIn estimating the net realizable value of the collateral, management may deem it appropriate to discount the appraisal based on the applicable circumstances. In\nsuch case, the amount charged off may result in loan principal outstanding being below fair value as presented in the appraisal.\n68\nTable of Contents\nBetween the receipt of the original appraisal and the updated appraisal, we monitor the loan's repayment history. If the loan is $3.0 million or greater or the\ntotal loan relationship is $5.0 million or greater, our policy requires an annual credit review. Our policy requires financial statements from the borrowers and\nguarantors at least annually. In addition, we calculate the global repayment ability of the borrower/guarantors at least annually.\nAs a general rule, when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected, generally at 90 days past due, or by law at\n105 days past due, we will reflect that loan as non-performing. It will remain non-performing until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we\nwill collect the full principal and accrued interest.\nWhen the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been determined, a charge-off should be taken in the period it is determined. If a partial charge-off\noccurs, the quarterly impairment analysis will determine if the loan is still impaired, and thus continues to require a specific allocation.\nThe Company had $94.9 million and $221.1 million in impaired loans (which includes loans individually analyzed for credit losses for which a specific reserve\nhas been recorded, non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty) at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoans Collectively Evaluated for Credit Loss. Loans receivable collectively evaluated for credit loss increased by approximately $62.3 million from $14.19\nbillion at December 31, 2022 to $14.25 billion at December 31, 2023. The percentage of the allowance for credit losses allocated to loans receivable collectively\nevaluated for credit loss to the total loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased from 1.82% at December 31, 2022 to 1.98% at December 31, 2023.\nCharge-offs and Recoveries. Total charge-offs decreased to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Total recoveries decreased to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2022.\nNet loans charged off for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $13.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, approximately $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Arkansas market. For the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, approximately $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Florida market. For the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, approximately $4.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Texas market. Approximately $36,000 and $55,000\nrelated to net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on loans in our Alabama market. For the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, approximately $305,000 and $290,000 of the net charge-offs were from our SPF market. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\napproximately $4.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Centennial CFG market.\nWhile the 2023 charge-offs and recoveries consisted of many relationships, there were two individual relationships that consisted of charge-offs greater than\n$1.0 million. The first was a $3.1 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Centennial CFG market, and the second was a $1.5 million charge-\noff for a commercial real estate loan in our Florida market.\nWhile the 2022 charge-offs and recoveries consisted of many relationships, there were three individual relationships consisting of charge-offs greater than $1.0\nmillion. The first was a $4.0 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Florida market. The second was a $3.6 million charge-off for a\ncommercial and industrial loan in our Centennial CFG market, and the third was a $1.5 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Centennial\nCFG market.\nWe have not charged off an amount less than what was determined to be the fair value of the collateral as presented in the appraisal, less estimated costs to sell\n(for collateral dependent loans), for any period presented. Loans partially charged-off are placed on non-accrual status until it is proven that the borrower's\nrepayment ability with respect to the remaining principal balance can be reasonably assured.

Securities within the portfolio are\nclassified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity. Fair values of\nsecurities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of\ncomparable securities. The estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was 5.07 years as of December 31, 2023.\nSecurities held-to-maturity, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost\nadjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. We had $1.28 billion and $1.29 billion of held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, $1.11 billion, or 86.5%, were invested in obligations of state and political subdivisions, compared to\n$1.11 billion, or 86.2%, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $43.3 million, or 3.4%, were invested in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored\nenterprises, compared to $43.0 million, or 3.3%, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $130.3 million, or 10.2%, were invested in U.S. Government-\nsponsored mortgage-backed securities, compared to $135.0 million, or 10.5%, as of December 31, 2022.\nSecurities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity as\nother comprehensive income. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold\nin response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale.\nAvailable-for-sale securities were $3.51 billion and $4.04 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n71\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, $1.52 billion, or 43.3%, of our available-for-sale securities were invested in U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities, compared to $1.69 billion, or 41.7%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. To reduce our income tax burden, $916.3 million, or\n26.1%, of our available-for-sale securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023, were primarily invested in tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions,\ncompared to $906.3 million, or 22.4%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. We had $346.6 million, or 9.9%, invested in obligations of\nU.S. Government-sponsored enterprises as of December 31, 2023, compared to $661.8 million, or 16.4%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31,\n2022. We had $363.5 million, or 10.4%, invested in non-government-sponsored asset backed securities as of December 31, 2023, compared to $414.4 million, or\n10.3%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $175.4 million, or 5.0%, of our available-for-sale securities were\ninvested in private mortgage-backed securities, compared to $179.1 million, or 4.4%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022. Also, we had\napproximately $185.6 million, or 5.3%, invested in other securities as of December 31, 2023, compared to $194.5 million, or 4.8% of our available-for-sale\nsecurities as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC\n326. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nincome. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In\nmaking this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency,\nand adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows\nexpected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less\nthan the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes\nin the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, one of the Company’s AFS subordinated debt investment securities was downgraded below investment grade. As\nresult, the Company wrote down the value of the investment to its unrealized loss position, which required a $1.7 million provision. The remaining $842,000\nallowance for credit losses on AFS investments is associated with certain securities in the subordinated debt portfolio within the banking sector. These investments\nare classified within the other securities category of the AFS portfolio. The $2.0 million allowance for credit losses for the held-to-maturity portfolio was\nconsidered adequate. No additional provision for credit losses was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio.\nTable 16 presents the carrying value and fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 16: Investment Securities\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Allowance for Net Carrying Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Credit Losses Amount Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises $ 361,494 $ — $ 361,494 $ 2,247 $ (17,093) $ 346,648\nU.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 1,711,668 — 1,711,668 310 (191,557) 1,520,421\nPrivate mortgage-backed securities 191,522 — 191,522 — (16,117) 175,405\nNon-government-sponsored asset backed securities 370,203 — 370,203 821 (7,551) 363,473\nState and political subdivisions 990,318 — 990,318 1,938 (75,931) 916,325\nOther securities 215,722 (2,525) 213,197 402 (28,030) 185,569\nTotal $ 3,840,927 $ (2,525) $ 3,838,402 $ 5,718 $ (336,279) $ 3,507,841\n72\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Allowance for Net Carrying Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Credit Losses Amount Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nHeld-to-maturity\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises $ 43,285 $ — $ 43,285 $ — $ (2,607) $ 40,678\nU.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 130,278 — 130,278 106 (4,362) 126,022\nState and political subdivisions 1,110,424 (2,005) 1,108,419 456 (105,094) 1,003,781\nTotal $ 1,283,987 $ (2,005) $ 1,281,982 $ 562 $ (112,063) $ 1,170,481\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross Gross\nAmortized Allowance for Net Carrying Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Credit Losses Amount Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises $ 682,316 $ — $ 682,316 $ 2,713 $ (23,209) $ 661,820\nU.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 1,900,796 — 1,900,796 71 (215,405) 1,685,462\nPrivate mortgage-backed securities 197,435 — 197,435 — (18,302) 179,133\nNon-government-sponsored asset backed securities 428,933 — 428,933 95 (14,654) 414,374\nState and political subdivisions 1,021,188 (842) 1,020,346 1,649 (115,698) 906,297\nOther securities 214,952 — 214,952 251 (20,699) 194,504\nTotal $ 4,445,620 $ (842) $ 4,444,778 $ 4,779 $ (407,967) $ 4,041,590\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross Gross\nAmortized Allowance for Net Carrying Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Credit Losses Amount Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nHeld-to-maturity\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises $ 43,017 $ — $ 43,017 $ — $ (3,349) $ 39,668\nU.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 135,000 — 135,000 131 (3,756) 131,375\nState and political subdivisions 1,111,693 (2,005) 1,109,688 65 (154,650) 955,103\nTotal $ 1,289,710 $ (2,005) $ 1,287,705 $ 196 $ (161,755) $ 1,126,146\nTable 17 reflects the amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, by\ncontractual maturity as well as the weighted-average yields (for tax-exempt obligations on a fully taxable equivalent basis) of those securities by contractual\nmaturity.

investment type and maturity. Tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing\nincome from tax-free investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable\nto taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon 24.989% and 24.6735% income tax rates for 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, $31.6\nmillion of interest income on debt securities was excluded from Federal taxation, and $18.9 million was excluded from state taxation. In 2022, $28.4 million of\ninterest income on debt securities was excluded from Federal taxation, and $12.3 million was excluded from state taxation.\nDeposits\nOur deposits averaged $17.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $17.93 billion for 2022. Total deposits decreased $1.15 billion, or 6.4%, to\n$16.79 billion as of December 31, 2023, from $17.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. Uninsured deposits including related interest accrued and unpaid were $8.34\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $9.83 billion as of December 31, 2022. Deposits are our primary source of funds. We offer a variety of products\ndesigned to attract and retain deposit customers. Those products consist of checking accounts, regular savings deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts\nand certificates of deposit. Deposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. In addition, we obtain deposits from state and\nlocal entities and, to a lesser extent, U.S. Government and other depository institutions.\nOur policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. From time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, we accept brokered\ntime deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250,000, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks. We also participate in the\nOne-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) service and similar services, which provide for one-way buy transactions among banks for the purpose of purchasing\ncost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these sources represent a reliable and cost-\nefficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant\nchanges in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain\nalternate sources for funding.\nTable 18 reflects the classification of the brokered deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 18: Brokered Deposits\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nTime Deposits $ — $ —\nInsured Cash Sweep and Other Transaction Accounts 401,004 476,630\nTotal Brokered Deposits $ 401,004 $ 476,630\nThe interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. We will continue to\nmanage interest expense through deposit pricing. We may allow higher rate deposits to run off during periods of limited loan demand. We believe that additional\nfunds can be attracted, and deposit growth can be realized through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs.\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest,\nincluding the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate seven times during 2022. First, on March 16,\n2022, the target rate was increased to 0.25% to 0.50%. Second, on May 4, 2022, the target rate was increased to 0.75% to 1.00%. Third, on June 15, 2022, the target\nrate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75%. Fourth, on July 27, 2022, the target rate was increased to 2.25% to 2.50%. Fifth, on September 21, 2022, the target rate was\nincreased to 3.00% to 3.25%.

At December 31, 2022, $50.0 million and $600.0\nmillion of the outstanding balance was classified as short-term and long-term advances, respectively. The FHLB advances mature from 2025 to 2037 with fixed\ninterest rates ranging from 3.37% to 4.84% and are secured by loans and investments securities. Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities\nbecause the FHLB has have the right to call or the Company has the right to prepay certain obligations.\nOther borrowed funds were $701.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and were classified as short-term advances.

We, as well as our bank subsidiary, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that, if enforced, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific\ncapital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting\npractices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components, risk weightings and other factors.\n80\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems” and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act\n(“Basel III”). Basel III applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and savings and loan\nholding companies. Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III limits a banking organization’s capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1\ncapital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nBasel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements\nfor certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at\nleast a 4.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and an 8% total risk-based capital ratio.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of\ntotal and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nwe met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2032 Notes in aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The 2032\nNotes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on January 30, 2032. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment\ndate of January 30, 2027, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the 2032 Notes, in whole or in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve\nif then required, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2032 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding\nthe date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the 2032 Notes at any time, including prior to January 30, 2027, at the Company’s option, in whole but not\nin part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, if certain events occur that could impact the Company’s ability to deduct interest payable\non the 2032 Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes or preclude the 2032 Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, or if the\nCompany is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In each case, the redemption would be at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2032 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company acquired $140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 from\nHappy, and the Company recorded approximately $144.4 million which included fair value adjustments. The 2030 Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt\nobligations of the Company and will mature on July 31, 2030. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of July 31, 2025, and on any interest\npayment date thereafter, redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole or in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, at a redemption price equal to\n100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also\nredeem the 2030 Notes at any time, including prior to July 31, 2025, at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal\nReserve if then required, if certain events occur that could impact the Company’s ability to deduct interest payable on the 2030 Notes for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes or preclude the 2030 Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, or if the Company is required to register as an\ninvestment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

As part of\nits response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to\ntemporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding\ncompanies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit\nlosses since adopting CECL.

Examples of these commitments include but are not limited to operating\nlease obligations, FHLB advances & other borrowings, lines of credit, subordinated debentures, unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.\nCommitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding, conditional agreements generally having certain expiration or termination dates. These\ncommitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. The\ncommitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment does not necessarily represent future requirements.\n83\nTable of Contents\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are\nprimarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company had total outstanding letters of credit\namounting to $185.5 million and $184.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with the majority of maturities ranging from currently due to four\nyears.\nTable 23 presents the anticipated funding requirements of our most significant financial commitments, excluding interest, as of December 31, 2023.\nTable 23: Funding Requirements of Financial Commitments\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than One-Three Three-Five Greater than\nOne Year Years Years Five Years Total\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease obligations $ 9,373 $ 16,660 $ 12,719 $ 19,827 $ 58,579\nFHLB advances & other borrowings by contractual maturity 701,300 200,000 — 400,000 1,301,300\nSubordinated debentures — — — 439,834 439,834\nLoan commitments 1,734,513 2,016,760 397,138 439,735 4,588,146\nLetters of credit 185,360 — 100 — 185,460\nNon-GAAP Financial Measurements\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the prevailing practices in the\nbanking industry. However, this report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, including earnings, as adjusted;\ndiluted earnings per common share, as adjusted; tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average\nassets, as adjusted; return on average common equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible\nequity, as adjusted; tangible equity to tangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing our operating results and\nrelated trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a\nsubstitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below present non-GAAP reconciliations of earnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, as well as the non-GAAP\ncomputations of tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average\ncommon equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible equity, as adjusted; tangible equity to\ntangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted. The items used in these calculations are included in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they exclude\ncertain items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains and losses. Management believes the exclusion of these items in expressing earnings provides a\nmeaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing\nour financial measures and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of our\nbusiness, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance.\n84\nTable of Contents\nIn Table 24 below, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.\nTable 24: Earnings, As Adjusted\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nGAAP net income available to common shareholders (A) $ 392,929 $ 305,262 $ 319,021\nAdjustments:\nFDIC special assessment 12,983 — —\nBOLI death benefit (3,117) — —\nFair value adjustment for marketable securities 1,094 1,272 (7,178)\nInitial provision for credit losses - acquisition — 58,585 —\nGain on securities — — (219)\nRecoveries on historic losses (3,461) (6,706) (5,107)\nBranch write-off expense — — —\nSpecial dividend from equity investment — (1,434) (12,500)\nMerger expenses — 49,594 1,886\nHurricane expenses — 176 —\nTRUPS redemption fees — 2,081 —\nSpecial lawsuit settlement, net of expense — (10,000) —\nTotal adjustments 7,499 93,568 (23,118)\nTax-effect of adjustments(1) 1,959 22,890 (6,225)\nTotal adjustments after tax (B) 5,540 70,678 (16,893)\nEarnings, as adjusted (C) $ 398,469 $ 375,940 $ 302,128\nAverage diluted shares outstanding (D) 202,773 195,019 164,858\nGAAP diluted earnings per share: A/D $ 1.94 $ 1.57 $ 1.94\nAdjustments after-tax: B/D 0.03 0.36 (0.11)\nDiluted earnings per common share excluding adjustments: C/D $ 1.97 $ 1.93 $ 1.83\n_____________________\n(1) Blended statutory tax rate of 24.989% for 2023, 24.6735% for 2022 and 25.740% for 2021.\nWe had $1.45 billion, $1.46 billion and $998.1 million total goodwill, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nAsset/Liability Management. Our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk. The asset/liability committees of the boards of directors of our\nholding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset/liability management policies, overseeing the formulation and implementation of\nstrategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position.\nOur objective is to manage liquidity in a way that ensures cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in a timely and orderly fashion while\nensuring the reliance on various funding sources does not become so heavily weighted to any one source that it causes undue risk to the bank. Our liquidity sources\nare prioritized based on availability and ease of activation. Our current liquidity condition is a primary driver in determining our funding needs and is a key\ncomponent of our asset liability management.\nVarious sources of liquidity are available to meet the cash flow needs of depositors and borrowers. Our principal source of funds is core deposits, including\nchecking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We may also from time to time obtain wholesale funding through brokered deposits.\nSecondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings,\nsuch as through correspondent banking relationships. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to\nus. Additionally, as needed, we can liquidate or utilize our available for sale investment portfolio as collateral to provide funds for an intermediate source of\nliquidity.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings, primarily net interest income, are susceptible to changes in market interest\nrates. It is management’s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks.\nA key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed. The single most significant measure of\ninterest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The more closely the repricing periods are correlated,\nthe less interest rate risk we assume. We use net interest income simulation modeling and economic value of equity as the primary methods in analyzing and\nmanaging interest rate risk.\nOne of the tools that our management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model. This analysis calculates the\ndifference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario. The income simulation model\nincludes various assumptions regarding the re-pricing relationships for each of our products. Many of our assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to re-\nprice immediately, and proportional to the change in market rates, depending on their contracted index. Some loans and investments include the opportunity of\nprepayment (embedded options), and accordingly, the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields.\nOur non-term deposit products re-price overnight in the model while we project certain other deposits by product type to have stable balances based on our deposit\nhistory. This accounts for the portion of our portfolio that moves more slowly than market rates and changes at our discretion.\nThis analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet remains\nstatic and that its structure does not change over the course of the year. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by\nmanagement to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change.\nFurthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates\nthat will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net\ninterest income.\nFor the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by 200 and 100 basis\npoints, respectively. At December 31, 2023, our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current\nguidelines established by us.\n89\nTable of Contents\nTable 31 presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of December 31, 2023.\nTable 31: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income\nInterest Rate Scenario Percentage Change from Base\nUp 200 basis points 9.61 %\nUp 100 basis points 4.93\nDown 100 basis points (5.70)\nDown 200 basis points (11.82)\nItem 8.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\nCompany;\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, the Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013 edition) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management's assessment and those criteria,\nmanagement believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nFORVIS, LLP, Little Rock, Arkansas, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm I.D.:686), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, is included herein.\n90\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nHome BancShares, Inc.\nConway, Arkansas\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Home BancShares, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each\nof the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which it relates.\n91\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company’s loan portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) were $14.4 billion\nand $288.2 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company estimates the ACL based on internal and external information relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate expected losses for all of the\nCompany’s loan segments that exhibit similar risk characteristics and loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For each loan\nsegment, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level adjusting payment expectations for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time\nto recovery, probability of default and loss given default. Additional qualitative adjustments are applied for risk factors that are not considered within the modeling\nprocess but are relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan segments. Consideration is given to the following factors: changes in lending\npolicies, procedures and strategies; changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; staff experience; changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies\nand nonaccruals; concentration risk; trends in underlying collateral values; external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; changes in the\nquality of the loan review system; and economic conditions.\nAuditing management’s estimate of the allowances for loan credit losses, and more specifically the qualitative factor adjustments applied in the ACL, is a critical\naudit matter. The principal consideration for our determination of the critical audit matter is a high degree of subjectivity of the assumptions utilized in calculating\nthe qualitative reserve component within the model. Furthermore, certain inputs and assumptions lack observable data and, therefore, applying audit procedures\nrequired a higher degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address this matter.\nThe primary audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the reliability and accuracy of data used to\ncalculate and estimate the various components of the ACL including:\n◦ Loan data completeness and accuracy,\n◦ Grouping of loans by segment,\n◦ Model inputs utilized,\n◦ Approval of model assumptions selected, and\n◦ Qualitative factors have been appropriately identified, are adequately supported, and accurately applied.\n• Evaluated and tested the data and inputs utilized within the ACL calculation for completeness and accuracy including mathematical accuracy of the\ncalculation.\n• Evaluated the qualitative factors for appropriate identification and application including reasonableness of the basis for adjustment.\n• Analyzed the total qualitative factor adjustment applied to each loan segment, in comparison to changes in the Company’s quantitatively driven expected\ncredit losses and loan segments and evaluated the appropriateness of the total qualitative factor adjustments applied in the overall allowance.\n• Utilized the assistance of the firm’s internal specialists to test the mathematical operation of the model.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nFebruary 26, 2024\n92\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nHome BancShares, Inc.\nConway, Arkansas\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Home BancShares, Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated\nFebruary 26, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our\naudit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinitions and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nFebruary 26, 2024\n93\nTable of Contents\nHome BancShares, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember

Contents\nHome BancShares, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nHome BancShares, Inc. (the “Company” or “HBI”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas. The Company is primarily engaged in\nproviding a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary – Centennial Bank (sometimes referred\nto as “Centennial” or the “Bank”). The Bank has branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama, Texas and New York City. The Company is subject to\ncompetition from other financial institutions. The Company also is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic\nexaminations by those regulatory authorities.\nA summary of the significant accounting policies of the Company follows:\nOperating Segments\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating\ndecision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Bank is the only significant subsidiary upon which management makes\ndecisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Each of the branches of the Bank provide a group of similar banking services, including\nsuch products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts. The individual bank branches have similar\noperating and economic characteristics. While the chief decision maker monitors the revenue streams of the various products, services and branch locations,\noperations are managed, and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the banking services and branch locations are\nconsidered by management to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of\ninvestment securities, the valuation of foreclosed assets and the valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. In connection with\nthe determination of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HBI and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nVarious items within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for previous years have been reclassified to provide more comparative information.\nThese reclassifications had no effect on net earnings or stockholders’ equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash held as demand deposits at various banks and the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) and interest-bearing\ndeposits with other banks.\n100\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nInterest on investment securities is recorded as income as earned. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded as interest income from\nsecurities. Realized gains and losses are recorded as net security gains (losses). Gains or losses on the sale of securities are determined using the specific\nidentification method.\nManagement determines the classification of securities as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or trading at the time of purchase based on the intent and\nobjective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity. Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices\nare not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. The Company has no trading securities.\nDebt securities available-for-sale (\"AFS\") are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’\nequity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management\nstrategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar\nfactors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for\ncredit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more\nlikely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or\nrequirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the\nCompany evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are\ncompared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss\nexists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any\nimpairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to\nexclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when\nmanagement believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nDebt securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at\nhistorical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a\nloss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company measures\nexpected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected\ncredit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made\nthe election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the\nallowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the\nprincipal balance outstanding. Loan origination fees and direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as adjustments to yield on the related loans.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed\nand expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\n101\nTable of Contents\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments\nto historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,\ndelinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, national\nretail sales index, housing price indices and rental vacancy rate index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments\nare as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - SPF\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans evaluated individually that are\nconsidered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of\nestimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral,\nexpected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the\noperation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of\nthe loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the\nloss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n• Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be\nexecuted with an individual borrower.\n• The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the\nCompany.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing\nthe expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors (\"Q-Factors\") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's\nestimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making\nQ-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in\nnature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration\nrisk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan\nreview system and (ix) economic conditions.\n102\nTable of Contents\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower’s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business\nconditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the\nallowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally\ncharged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-\naccrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at\nleast six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use\nof the purchase method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 326, the Company\nrecords both a discount or premium and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair\nvalue methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to\nexpected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are purchase credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. An\nallowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The Company develops separate PCD models for each loan segment with\nPCD loans not individually analyzed for credit losses. These models utilize a peer group benchmark in order to determine the probability of default and loss given\ndefault to be used in the calculation. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference\nbetween the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of\nthe loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses.\nFor further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend\ncredit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a\nprovision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on\ncommitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale\nReal estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the\ndate of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis.\nValuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses\nfrom the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-\ninterest expense.\nBank Premises and Equipment\nBank premises and equipment are carried at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements whichever is\nshorter. The assets’ estimated useful lives for book purposes are as follows:\nBank premises 15-40 years\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment 3-15 years\n103\nTable of Contents\nCash value of life insurance\nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key employees. Life insurance owned by the Company is recorded at the amount that can be\nrealized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable\nat settlement.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in\nbusiness acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation\nspecialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 120 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather, is evaluated for\nimpairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if changes or circumstances occur. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and\ncore deposit intangibles during 2023, 2022 and 2021, as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The 2023, 2022 and 2021 tests indicated no\nimpairment of the Company’s goodwill or core deposit intangibles.\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase consist of obligations of the Company to other parties. At the point funds deposited by customers become\ninvestable, those funds are used to purchase securities owned by the Company and held in its general account with the designation of Customers’ Securities. A third\nparty maintains control over the securities underlying overnight repurchase agreements. The securities involved in these transactions are generally U.S. Treasury or\nFederal Agency issues. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature on the banking day following that on which the investment was initially\npurchased and are treated as collateralized financing transactions which are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. Interest\nrates and maturity dates of the securities involved vary and are not intended to be matched with funds from customers.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may enter into derivative contracts for the purposes of managing exposure to interest rate risk. The Company records all derivatives on the\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value. Historically the Company’s policy has been not to invest in derivative type investments.\nThe Company has standalone derivative financial instruments acquired in a previous acquisition. These derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate\nswaps and are recognized as assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. The Bank’s derivative instruments have not\nbeen designated as hedging instruments. These undesignated derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with changes in\nfair value recorded in other non-interest income. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had derivative contracts outstanding\nassociated with the mortgage loans held for sale portfolio. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, these derivative instruments are not considered to be material to the\nCompany’s financial position and results of operations.\nStock Options\nThe Company accounts for stock options in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which establishes standards for the\naccounting for transactions in which an entity (i) exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services, or (ii) incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and\nservices that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments. FASB ASC 718 requires\nthat such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date, which is generally the date\nof the grant.\nFor additional information on the stock-based compensation plan, see Note 13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance\nresults in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by\napplying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines deferred income taxes using\nthe liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and\ntax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n104\nTable of Contents\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely\nthan not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of\nmore than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that\nmeets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax\nposition has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to\nmanagement’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns. Its subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to the Company\namounts determined to be currently payable.\nRevenue Recognition.\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing\nand uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to\nrecognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in\nexchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to\nASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as\nthese activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our significant revenue-generating activities that are within\nthe scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:\n• Service charges on deposit accounts – These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and\nconsist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue\nis recognized when our performance obligation is completed which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been\ncompleted (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.\n• Other service charges and fees – These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial Commercial Finance Group (“Centennial CFG”) loan fees.\nThe interchange fees are recorded in the period the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts.\nThe Centennial CFG loan fees are based on loan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310.\n• Trust fees - The Company enters into contracts with its customers to manage assets for investment, and/or transact on their accounts. The Company\ngenerally satisfies its performance obligations as services are rendered. The management fees are percentage based, flat, percentage of income or a fixed\npercentage calculated upon the average balance of assets depending upon account type. Fees are collected on a monthly or annual basis.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share is computed\nusing the weighted-average shares and all potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and\ndiluted earnings per share (EPS) for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet income $ 392,929 $ 305,262 $ 319,021\nAverage common shares outstanding 202,627 194,694 164,501\nEffect of common stock options 146 325 357\nDiluted common shares outstanding 202,773 195,019 164,858\nBasic earnings per common share $ 1.94 $ 1.57 $ 1.94\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 1.94 $ 1.57 $ 1.94\n105\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company's stock options were dilutive to earnings per share. The impact of anti-dilutive shares to the diluted\nearnings per share calculation was considered immaterial for the periods ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n2. Business Combinations\nAcquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc. (“Happy”), and merged Happy State Bank into Centennial Bank. The\nCompany issued approximately 42.4 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately $958.8 million as of April 1, 2022. In addition, the holders of\ncertain Happy stock-based awards received approximately $3.7 million in cash in cancellation of such awards, for a total transaction value of approximately\n$962.5 million. The acquisition added new markets for expansion and brought complementary businesses together to drive synergies and growth.\nIncluding the effects of the known purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, Happy had approximately $6.69 billion in total assets,\n$3.65 billion in loans and $5.86 billion in customer deposits. Happy formerly operated its banking business from 62 locations in Texas.\nThe Company has determined that the acquisition of the net assets of Happy constitutes a business combination as defined by ASC Topic 805, Business\nCombinations. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their fair values as required. Fair values were determined based on the\nrequirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. In many cases, the determination of these fair values required management to make estimates about\ndiscount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature. The following schedule is a breakdown of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\n106\nTable of Contents\nHappy Bancshares, Inc.\nAcquired Fair Value As Recorded by\nfrom Happy Adjustments HBI\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 112,999 $ (446) $ 112,553\nInterest-bearing deposits with other banks 746,031 — 746,031\nCash and cash equivalents 859,030 (446) 858,584\nInvestment securities - available-for-sale, net of allowance for credit losses 1,773,540 8,485 1,782,025\nTotal investment securities 1,773,540 8,485 1,782,025\nLoans receivable 3,657,009 (4,389) 3,652,620\nAllowance for credit losses (42,224) 25,408 (16,816)\nLoans receivable, net 3,614,785 21,019 3,635,804\nBank premises and equipment, net 153,642 (12,270) 141,372\nForeclosed assets held for sale 193 (77) 116\nCash value of life insurance 105,049 3 105,052\nAccrued interest receivable 31,575 — 31,575\nDeferred tax asset, net 32,908 (1,092) 31,816\nGoodwill 130,428 (130,428) —\nCore deposit intangible 10,672 31,591 42,263\nOther assets 43,330 15,567 58,897\nTotal assets acquired $ 6,755,152 $ (67,648) $ 6,687,504\nLiabilities\nDeposits\nDemand and non-interest-bearing $ 1,932,756 $ 67 $ 1,932,823\nSavings and interest-bearing transaction accounts 3,519,652 — 3,519,652\nTime deposits 401,899 903 402,802\nTotal deposits 5,854,307 970 5,855,277\nFHLB and other borrowed funds 74,212 4,118 78,330\nAccrued interest payable and other liabilities 50,889 (1,892) 48,997\nSubordinated debentures 159,965 7,625 167,590\nTotal liabilities assumed 6,139,373 10,821 6,150,194\nEquity\nTotal equity assumed 615,779 (615,779) —\nTotal liabilities and equity assumed $ 6,755,152 $ (604,958) $ 6,150,194\nNet assets acquired 537,310\nPurchase price 962,538\nGoodwill $ 425,228\n107\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above:\nCash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold – The carrying amount of these assets was deemed a reasonable\nestimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.\nInvestment securities – Investment securities were acquired from Happy with an approximately $8.5 million adjustment to fair value based upon quoted market\nprices. Otherwise the book value was deemed to approximate fair value.\nLoans – Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral,\nclassification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, whether or not the loan was amortizing and current discount rates. The discount rates used for loans\nare based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity concerns. The discount rate does not include a\nfactor for credit losses as that has been included in the estimated cash flows. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in\nthe aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. See Note 5 to the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information\nrelated to purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.\nBank premises and equipment – Bank premises and equipment were acquired from Happy with a $12.3 million adjustment to fair value. This represents the\ndifference between current appraisals completed in connection with the acquisition and book value acquired.\nForeclosed assets held for sale – These assets are presented at the estimated fair values that management expects to receive when the properties are sold, net of\nrelated costs of disposal.\nCash value of life insurance – Bank owned life insurance is carried at its current cash surrender value, which is the most reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAccrued interest receivable – The carrying amount of these assets was deemed a reasonable estimate of the fair value.\nCore deposit intangible – This core deposit intangible asset represents the value of the relationships that Happy had with its deposit customers. The fair value\nof this intangible asset was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, cost of\nthe deposit base, and the net maintenance cost attributable to customer deposits.\nDeposits – The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits that comprise the transaction accounts acquired, by definition, equal the amount payable\non demand at the acquisition date. The $903,000 fair value adjustment applied for time deposits was because the weighted-average interest rate of Happy’s\ncertificates of deposits were estimated to be above the current market rates.\nFHLB borrowed funds – The fair value of FHLB borrowed funds is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings\nwith similar terms and maturities.\nAccrued interest payable and other liabilities – The fair value adjustment results from certain liabilities whose value was estimated to be more or less than book\nvalue, such as certain accounts payable and other miscellaneous liabilities. The carrying amount of accrued interest and the remainder of other liabilities was\ndeemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nSubordinated debentures – The fair value of subordinated debentures is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings\nwith similar terms and maturities.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe unaudited pro-forma combined consolidated financial information presents how the combined financial information of HBI and Happy might have\nappeared had the businesses actually been combined.

Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management\nstrategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar\nfactors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for\ncredit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326\"). The Company first assesses whether it intends to\nsell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria,\nthe Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the\nextent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are\ncompared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss\nexists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any\nimpairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to\nexclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when\nmanagement believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nDebt securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at\nhistorical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a\nloss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective\nbasis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information\nthat is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM\nsecurities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are\nrecorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security\nis confirmed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, one of the Company’s AFS subordinated debt investment securities was downgraded below investment grade. As\nresult, the Company wrote down the value of the investment to its unrealized loss position, which required a $1.7 million provision. The remaining $842,000\nallowance for credit losses on AFS investments is associated with certain securities in the subordinated debt portfolio within the banking sector. These investments\nare classified within the other securities category of the AFS portfolio. The $2.0 million allowance for credit losses for the held-to-maturity portfolio was\nconsidered adequate. No additional provision for credit losses was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 842 $ 842 $ 842\nProvision for credit loss 1,683 — —\nEnding balance, December 31, $ 2,525 $ 842 $ 842\n113\nTable of Contents\nHeld-to-Maturity Investment Securities\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAllowance for credit losses: (In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 2,005 $ — $ —\nProvision for credit loss - acquired securities — 2,005 —\nSecurities charged-off — — —\nRecoveries — — —\nEnding balance, December 31, $ 2,005 $ 2,005 $ —\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had available-for-sale investment securities with approximately $333.5 million in unrealized losses,\nwhich have been in continuous loss positions for more than twelve months. With the exception of the securities with credit losses noted above, the Company’s\nassessments indicated that the cause of the market depreciation was primarily due to the change in interest rates and not the issuer’s financial condition, or\ndowngrades by rating agencies. In addition, approximately 30.4% of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio will mature or are expected to pay\ndown within five years or less. As a result, the Company has the ability and intent to hold such securities until maturity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had available-for-sale investment securities with approximately $264.6 million in unrealized losses,\nwhich had been in continuous loss positions for more than twelve months. The Company’s assessments indicated that the cause of the market depreciation was\nprimarily due to the change in interest rates and not the issuer’s financial condition, or downgrades by rating agencies. In addition, approximately 33.0% of the\nCompany’s available-for-sale investment portfolio was expected to mature or pay down within five years or less. As a result, the Company has the ability and intent\nto hold such securities until maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted of 1,583 investment securities, 1,296 of which were in an unrealized\nloss position. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was $336.3 million. The U.S government-sponsored enterprises portfolio\ncontained unrealized losses of $17.1 million on 59 securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained $191.6 million of\nunrealized losses on 669 securities, and the private mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained $16.1 million of unrealized losses on 32 securities. The non-\ngovernment-sponsored asset backed securities portfolio contained $7.6 million of unrealized losses on 31 securities. The state and political subdivisions portfolio\ncontained. In addition, the other securities portfolio contained $75.9 million of unrealized losses on 444 securities. In addition, the other securities portfolio\ncontained $28.0 million of unrealized losses on 61 securities. With the exception of the investments for which an allowance for credit losses has been established,\nthe unrealized losses on the Company's investments were primarily a result of interest rate changes, and the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis\nover the term of the securities. The Company has determined that, as of December 31, 2023, an additional provision for credit losses is not necessary because the\ndecline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is\nnot more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's held-to-maturity securities portfolio consisted of 507 investment securities, 486 of which were in an unrealized loss\nposition. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was $112.1 million. The U.S. government-sponsored enterprises portfolio contained\nunrealized losses of $2.6 million on 5 securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained $4.4 million of unrealized losses\non 18 securities. The state and political subdivisions portfolio contained $105.1 million of unrealized losses on 463 securities. The unrealized losses on the\nCompany's held-to-maturity investments were a result of interest rate changes. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the\nsecurities. Because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company has determined that an additional\nprovision for credit losses is not necessary as of December 31, 2023.\n114\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes bond ratings for the Company's held-to-maturity portfolio, based upon amortized cost, issued by state and political\nsubdivisions and other securities as of December 31, 2023:\nU.S. government-\nState and Political U.S. government- sponsored mortgage-\nSubdivisions sponsored enterprises backed securities Total\n(In thousands)\nAaa/AAA $ 235,557 $ 43,285 $ — $ 278,842\nAa/AA 845,418 — — 845,418\nA 27,667 — — 27,667\nNot rated 1,782 — — 1,782\nAgency Backed — — 130,278 130,278\nTotal $ 1,110,424 $ 43,285 $ 130,278 $ 1,283,987\nIncome earned on securities for the years ended is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nTaxable:\nAvailable-for-sale $ 108,650 $ 71,352 $ 30,054\nHeld-to-maturity 29,925 20,581 —\nTax-exempt:\nAvailable-for-sale 19,104 19,168 19,642\nHeld-to-maturity 12,514 9,188 —\nTotal $ 170,193 $ 120,289 $ 49,696\n4.

Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date,\nHappy had approximately $3.65 billion in loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold $3.7 million of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans, which resulted in a gain of\napproximately $278,000. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold $4.1 million of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans, which resulted\nin a gain of $183,000. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold $22.7 million of the guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans, which resulted\nin a gain of $2.4 million.\nMortgage loans held for sale of approximately $123.4 million and $79.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in residential 1-4\nfamily loans. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, determined using an aggregate basis. Gains and losses resulting from sales\nof mortgage loans are recognized when the respective loans are sold to investors. Gains and losses are determined by the difference between the selling price and\nthe carrying amount of the loans sold, net of discounts collected or paid. The Company obtains forward commitments to sell mortgage loans to reduce market risk\non mortgage loans in the process of origination and mortgage loans held for sale. The forward commitments acquired by the Company for mortgage loans in\nprocess of origination are considered mandatory forward commitments. Because these commitments are structured on a mandatory basis, the Company is required\nto substitute another loan or to buy back the commitment if the original loan does not fund. The Company regularly sells mortgages into the capital markets to\nmitigate the effects of interest rate volatility during the period from the time an interest rate lock commitment (“IRLC”) is issued until the IRLC funds creating a\nmortgage loan held for sale and its subsequent sale into the secondary/capital markets. Loan sales are typically executed on a mandatory basis. Under a mandatory\ncommitment, the Company agrees to deliver a specified dollar amount with predetermined terms by a certain date. Generally, the commitment is not loan specific,\nand any combination of loans can be delivered into the outstanding commitment provided the terms fall within the parameters of the commitment. Upon failure to\ndeliver, the Company is subject to fees based on market movement. These commitments are derivative instruments and their fair values at December 31, 2023 and\n2022 were not material.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is\ndetermined using the same methodology as other loans. For PCD loans not individually analyzed for impairment, the Company develops separate PCD models for\neach loan segment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and\nallowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-\ncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded\nthrough the provision for credit losses. The Company held approximately $130.7 million and $142.5 million in PCD loans, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The balance, as of December 31, 2023, consisted of $130.4 million resulting from the acquisition of Happy and $376,100 from the acquisition of LH-\nFinance. The balance, as of December 31, 2022, consisted of $142.1 million resulting from the acquisition of Happy and $415,000 from the acquisition of LH-\nFinance.\n5. Allowance for Credit Losses, Credit Quality and Other\nThe Company uses the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to estimate expected losses for all of Company’s loan pools. These pools are as follows:\nconstruction & land development; other commercial real estate; residential real estate; commercial & industrial; and consumer & other. The loan portfolio pools\nwere selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council. For each of these loan pools, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted\nfor estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds,\ncurtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on historical internal data. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine\nsuitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of\ndefault and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing\nthe expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected\ncredit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other\nqualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of\nthe portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in\nunderlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system and\n(ix) economic conditions.\n116\nTable of Contents\nEach year management evaluates the performance of the selected models used in the CECL calculation through backtesting. Based on the results of the testing,\nmanagement determines if the various models produced accurate results compared to the actual losses incurred for the current economic environment. Management\nthen determines if changes to the input assumptions and economic factors would produce a stronger overall calculation that is more responsive to changes in\neconomic conditions. The Company continues to use regression analysis to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default\nand loss given default for the changes in the economic factors for the loss driver segments. The identified loss drivers by segment are included below as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLoss Driver Segment Call Report Segment(s) Modeled Economic Factors\n1-4 Family Construction 1a1 National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index (%)\nAll Other Construction 1a2 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\n1-4 Family Revolving HELOC & Junior Liens 1c1 National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index – CoreLogic (%)\n1-4 Family Revolving HELOC & Junior Liens 1c2b National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\n1-4 Family Senior Liens 1c2a National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nMultifamily 1d Rental Vacancy Rate (%) & Housing Price Index – Case-Schiller (%)\nOwner Occupied CRE 1e1 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nNon-Owner Occupied CRE 1e2,1b,8 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nCommercial & Industrial, Agricultural, Non-Depository Financial\n4a, 3, 9a, 9b1, 9b2, 10, Other National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nInstitutions, Purchase/Carry Securities, Other\nConsumer Auto 6c National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer 6b, 6d National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer - SPF 6d National Unemployment (%)\nFor all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate\nover four quarters on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver\nforecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when developing\nthe forecast metrics.\nThe combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and time expectations prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery produces an\nexpected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument\nexpected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present value of expected cash flows (“NPV”). An allowance for\ncredit loss is established for the difference between the instrument’s NPV and amortized cost basis.\nConstruction/Land Development and Other Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate non-farm and non-residential loans (primarily secured by commercial\nreal estate), construction/land development loans, and agricultural loans, which are generally secured by real estate located in our market areas. Our commercial\nmortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized (where defined) over a 15 to 30-year period with balloon payments due at the\nend of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by assessing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the\nfinancial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure,\neconomic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, we will loan up to 85% of the value of improved property, 65% of the value of raw land\nand 75% of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the collateral is rental property, with\nsecond lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis.\nResidential Real Estate Loans. We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market areas.\nResidential real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90%. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to many factors including the\nborrower’s ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio.\n117\nTable of Contents\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory,\nequipment and capital expansion. The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current\nfinancial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt\nservice coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management\nexperience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral.\nGenerally, accounts receivable are financed at between 50% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will range between\n50% and 80% (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans.\nConsumer & Other Loans. Our consumer & other loans are primarily composed of loans to finance United States Coast Guard registered high-end sail and\npower boats. The performance of consumer & other loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job\nloss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics.\nOff-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk\nvia a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit loss on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of\nexpected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company uses the DCF method to estimate expected losses for all of\nCompany’s off-balance sheet credit exposures through the use of the existing DCF models for the Company’s loan portfolio pools. The off-balance sheet credit\nexposures exhibit similar risk characteristics as loans currently in the Company’s loan portfolio.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $12.0 million provision for credit losses on loans, and the Company reversed $1.5 million\nin provision for unfunded commitments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Happy. As a result, the Company recorded $4.4 million in net loan\ndiscounts and a $16.8 million increase in the allowance for credit losses related to PCD loans. In addition, the Company recorded a $45.2 million provision for\ncredit losses on acquired loans for the CECL \"double count\" and an $11.4 million provision for credit losses on acquired unfunded commitments. In addition, the\nCompany recorded a $5.0 million provision for credit losses on loans due to increased loan growth. However, the Company determined that no additional provision\nwas necessary for unfunded commitments as the current level of the reserve was considered adequate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses on loans as the level of the allowance for credit losses was\nconsidered adequate, and the Company reversed $4.8 million in provision for unfunded commitments.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nConstruction/ Other\nLand Commercial Residential Commercial Consumer\nDevelopment Real Estate Real Estate & Industrial & Other Total\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 32,243 $ 93,848 $ 50,963 $ 89,354 $ 23,261 $ 289,669\nLoans charged off (263) (2,335) (269) (9,157) (4,031) (16,055)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 113 533 329 583 1,112 2,670\nNet loans recovered (charged off) (150) (1,802) 60 (8,574) (2,919) (13,385)\nProvision for credit loss - loans 1,784 (13,411) 4,837 12,030 6,710 11,950\nBalance, December 31 $ 33,877 $ 78,635 $ 55,860 $ 92,810 $ 27,052 $ 288,234\nThe following table presents the balance in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n118\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nOther\nConstruction/ Commercial Residential Commercial Consumer\nLand Development Real Estate Real Estate & Industrial & Other Total\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 28,415 $ 87,218 $ 48,458 $ 53,062 $ 19,561 $ 236,714\nAllowance for credit losses on PCD loans - Happy\nacquisition 950 9,283 980 5,596 7 16,816\nLoans charged off (1) — (446) (9,773) (7,047) (17,267)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 405 967 119 780 965 3,236\nNet loans recovered (charged off) 404 967 (327) (8,993) (6,082) (14,031)\nProvision for credit loss - acquired loans 7,205 18,711 7,380 11,303 571 45,170\nProvision for credit loss - loans (4,731) (22,331) (5,528) 28,386 9,204 5,000\nBalance, December 31 $ 32,243 $ 93,848 $ 50,963 $ 89,354 $ 23,261 $ 289,669\nThe following table presents the balance in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nOther\nConstruction/ Commercial Residential Commercial Consumer\nLand Development Real Estate Real Estate & Industrial & Other Total\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for loan losses:\nBeginning balance $ 32,861 $ 88,453 $ 53,216 $ 46,530 $ 24,413 $ 245,473\nLoans charged off — (646) (545) (8,242) (2,228) (11,661)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 58 785 683 591 785 2,902\nNet loans recovered (charged off) 58 139 138 (7,651) (1,443) (8,759)\nProvision for credit loss - loans (4,504) (1,374) (4,896) 14,183 (3,409) —\nBalance December 31 $ 28,415 $ 87,218 $ 48,458 $ 53,062 $ 19,561 $ 236,714\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status and loans past due over 90 days still accruing as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLoans Past Due\nNonaccrual Over 90 Days\nNonaccrual With Reserve Still Accruing\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 13,178 $ — $ 2,177\nConstruction/land development 12,094 — 255\nAgricultural 431 — —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 20,351 — 84\nMultifamily residential — — —\nTotal real estate 46,054 — 2,516\nConsumer 3,423 — 79\nCommercial and industrial 9,982 2,534 1,535\nAgricultural & other 512 — —\nTotal $ 59,971 $ 2,534 $ 4,130\n119\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nLoans Past Due\nNonaccrual Over 90 Days\nNonaccrual With Reserve Still Accruing\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 12,219 $ 8,383 $ 1,844\nConstruction/land development 1,977 — 31\nAgricultural 278 — —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 18,083 — 1,374\nMultifamily residential — — —\nTotal real estate 32,557 8,383 3,249\nConsumer 2,842 — 35\nCommercial and industrial 14,920 — 6,300\nAgricultural & other 692 — 261\nTotal $ 51,011 $ 8,383 $ 9,845\nThe Company had $60.0 million and $51.0 million in nonaccrual loans for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided\nsubstantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the\ncollateral, net of estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation\nof the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows\nfrom the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which\nthe amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the\nfair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan, net of estimated costs to sell.\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe following is an aging analysis for loans receivable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccruing\nLoans Loans Loans Loans\nPast Due Past Due Past Due Past Due\n30-59 60-89 90 Days Total Current Total Loans 90 Days\nDays Days or More Past Due Loans Receivable or More\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 8,124 $ 416 $ 15,355 $ 23,895 $ 5,526,059 $ 5,549,954 $ 2,177\nConstruction/land development 1,430 — 12,349 13,779 2,279,268 2,293,047 255\nAgricultural 474 314 431 1,219 323,937 325,156 —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 4,346 1,423 20,435 26,204 1,818,056 1,844,260 84\nMultifamily residential — — — — 435,736 435,736 —\nTotal real estate 14,374 2,153 48,570 65,097 10,383,056 10,448,153 2,516\nConsumer 1,022 303 3,502 4,827 1,148,863 1,153,690 79\nCommercial and industrial 2,089 3,378 11,517 16,984 2,308,007 2,324,991 1,535\nAgricultural and other 1,074 113 512 1,699 496,195 497,894 —\nTotal $ 18,559 $ 5,947 $ 64,101 $ 88,607 $ 14,336,121 $ 14,424,728 $ 4,130\nDecember 31, 2022\nAccruing\nLoans Loans Loans Loans\nPast Due Past Due Past Due Past Due\n30-59 60-89 90 Days Total Current Total Loans 90 Days\nDays Days or More Past Due Loans Receivable or More\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 4,242 $ 2,117 $ 14,063 $ 20,422 $ 5,611,641 $ 5,632,063 $ 1,844\nConstruction/land development 4,042 1,892 2,008 7,942 2,127,324 2,135,266 31\nAgricultural 1,469 193 278 1,940 344,871 346,811 —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 6,715 605 19,457 26,777 1,721,774 1,748,551 1,374\nMultifamily residential — — — — 578,052 578,052 —\nTotal real estate 16,468 4,807 35,806 57,081 10,383,662 10,440,743 3,249\nConsumer 950 539 2,877 4,366 1,145,530 1,149,896 35\nCommercial and industrial 3,007 1,075 21,220 25,302 2,323,961 2,349,263 6,300\nAgricultural and other 1,065 57 953 2,075 467,503 469,578 261\nTotal $ 21,490 $ 6,478 $ 60,856 $ 88,824 $ 14,320,656 $ 14,409,480 $ 9,845\nNon-accruing loans were $60.0 million and $51.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $2.5 million, $9.6 million and $14.7\nmillion, respectively.

As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality\nindicators including trends related to (i) the risk rating of loans, (ii) the level of classified loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) non-performing loans and (v) the general\neconomic conditions in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama and New York.\nThe Company utilizes a risk rating matrix to assign a risk rating to each of its loans. Loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 8. Descriptions of the general\ncharacteristics of the 8 risk ratings are as follows:\n• Risk rating 1 – Excellent. Loans in this category are to persons or entities of unquestionable financial strength, a highly liquid financial position, with\ncollateral that is liquid and well margined. These borrowers have performed without question on past obligations, and the Bank expects their performance\nto continue. Internally generated cash flow covers current maturities of long-term debt by a substantial margin. Loans secured by bank certificates of\ndeposit and savings accounts, with appropriate holds placed on the accounts, are to be rated in this category.\n• Risk rating 2 – Good. These are loans to persons or entities with strong financial condition and above-average liquidity that have previously satisfactorily\nhandled their obligations with the Bank. Collateral securing the Bank’s debt is margined in accordance with policy guidelines. Internally generated cash\nflow covers current maturities of long-term debt more than adequately. Unsecured loans to individuals supported by strong financial statements and on\nwhich repayment is satisfactory may be included in this classification.\n• Risk rating 3 – Satisfactory. Loans to persons or entities with an average financial condition, adequate collateral margins, adequate cash flow to service\nlong-term debt, and net worth comprised mainly of fixed assets are included in this category. These entities are minimally profitable now, with projections\nindicating continued profitability into the foreseeable future. Closely held corporations or businesses where a majority of the profits are withdrawn by the\nowners or paid in dividends are included in this rating category. Overall, these loans are basically sound.\n• Risk rating 4 – Watch. Borrowers who have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability or have experienced an unprofitable year and a declining financial\ncondition characterize these loans. The borrower has in the past satisfactorily handled debts with the Bank, but in recent months has either been late,\ndelinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments. While the Bank continues to be adequately secured, margins have decreased or are\ndecreasing, despite the borrower’s continued satisfactory condition. Other characteristics of borrowers in this class include inadequate credit information,\nweakness of financial statement and repayment capacity, but with collateral that appears to limit exposure.\n• Risk rating 5 – Other Loans Especially Mentioned (“OLEM”). A loan criticized as OLEM has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close\nattention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit\nposition at some future date. OLEM assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the institution to sufficient risks to warrant adverse classification.\n• Risk rating 6 – Substandard. A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the\ncollateral pledged. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual assets.\n• Risk rating 7 – Doubtful. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristic that\nthe weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nThese are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collectability in full in a\nreasonable period of time; in fact, there is permanent impairment in the collateral securing the loan.\n• Risk rating 8 – Loss. Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.\nThis classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off\nthis basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may occur in the future. This classification is based upon current facts, not probabilities. Assets\nclassified as loss should be charged-off in the period in which they became uncollectible.\nLoans may be classified, but not considered impaired, due to one of the following reasons: (1) The Company has established minimum dollar amount\nthresholds for loan impairment testing. All loans over $2.0 million that are rated 5 – 8 are individually assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans rated 5 –\n8 that fall under the threshold amount are not individually tested for impairment and therefore are not included in impaired loans; (2) of the loans that are above the\nthreshold amount and tested for impairment, after testing, some are considered to not be impaired and are not included in impaired loans.\n123\nTable of Contents\nBased on the most recent analysis performed,

The 2022 Plan replaced the Company’s Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan\n(the “2006 Plan” and, together with the 2022 Plan, the “Plans”), which expired on February 27, 2022. The purpose of the Plans is to attract and retain highly\nqualified officers, directors, key employees, and other persons, and to motivate those persons to improve the Company’s business results. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe maximum total number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the 2022 Plan was 14,788,000 shares (representing 13,288,000\nshares approved for issuance under the 2006 Plan plus 1,500,000 shares added upon adoption of the 2022 Plan).

The\nintrinsic value of the stock options vested at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $10.3 million, $7.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively.\nThe intrinsic value of the stock options exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.9 million, $1.8 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost, net of income tax benefit, related to non-vested awards, which are expected to be recognized over the vesting periods,\nwas approximately $3.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe table below summarized the stock option transactions under the Plan at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the years then ended:\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted- Weighted- Weighted-\naverage average average\nShares Exercisable Shares Exercisable Shares Exercisable\n(000) Price (000) Price (000) Price\nOutstanding, beginning of year 2,971 $ 20.45 3,015 $ 20.06 3,254 $ 19.77\nGranted 25 22.63 183 21.13 15 21.68\nForfeited/Expired (10) 23.38 (96) 21.89 (57) 22.44\nExercised (210) 14.01 (131) 11.30 (197) 14.78\nOutstanding, end of year 2,776 20.95 2,971 20.45 3,015 20.06\nExercisable, end of year 1,940 20.05 1,837 18.89 1,543 17.46\nStock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant-date fair value. For stock option awards, the fair value\nis estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which\ncan materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock\noptions granted but are not considered by the model. Accordingly, while management believes that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model provides a reasonable\nestimate of fair value, the model does not necessarily provide the best single measure of fair value for the Company's employee stock options. The weighted-\naverage fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.37, and the weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year\nended December 31, 2022 was $5.21. The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on\nthe weighted-average assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of options granted.\n139\nTable of Contents\nThe assumptions used in determining the fair value of 2023, 2022 and 2021 stock option grants were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected dividend yield 2.98 % 3.14 % 2.59 %\nExpected stock price volatility 27.97 % 31.18 % 70.13 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.37 % 2.82 % 0.75 %\nExpected life of options 6.5 years 6.5 years 6.5 years\nThe following is a summary of currently outstanding and exercisable options at December 31, 2023:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nWeighted-\nOptions Average Weighted- Options Weighted-\nOutstanding Remaining Average Exercisable Average\nShares Contractual Exercise Shares Exercise\nExercise Prices (000) Life (in years) Price (000) Price\n$14.00 to $15.99 100 1.04 $ 14.71 100 $ 14.71\n$16.00 to $17.99 172 0.91 16.92 172 16.92\n$18.00 to $19.99 836 1.79 18.48 829 18.48\n$20.00 to $21.99 268 4.72 20.87 191 20.98\n$22.00 to $23.99 1,309 4.65 23.22 577 23.14\n$24.00 to $25.99 91 4.40 25.59 71 25.95\n2,776 1,940\nThe table below summarizes the activity for the Company’s restricted stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and changes during\nthe years then ended:\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nBeginning of year 1,381 1,231 1,371\nIssued 261 409 216\nVested (152) (178) (320)\nForfeited (61) (81) (36)\nEnd of year 1,429 1,381 1,231\nAmount of expense for twelve months ended $ 8,016 $ 7,646 $ 7,112\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost, net of income tax benefit, related to non-vested restricted stock awards, which are expected to be recognized over the\nvesting periods, was approximately $11.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n140\nTable of Contents\n14.

Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Company has a combined 401(k) plan and employee stock ownership plan, named the Home BancShares, Inc. 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership\nPlan, in which substantially all employees may participate. The Company matches employees’ contributions based on a percentage of salary contributed by\nparticipants. As of December 31, 2023, participants in the plan held approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company’s stock. These shares are allocated to the\nindividual employees that have elected to own stock within the plan. While the plan also allows for discretionary employer contributions, no discretionary\ncontributions were made for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company’s expense for the plan was approximately $3.4 million, $3.1 million and $2.5\nmillion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included in salaries and employee benefits expense.\nChairman’s Retirement Plan\nOn April 20, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a Chairman’s Retirement Plan for John W. Allison, the Company’s Chairman. The Chairman’s\nRetirement Plan provides a supplemental retirement benefit of $250,000 a year for 10 consecutive years or until Mr. Allison’s death, whichever occurs later. During\n2011, Mr. Allison reached the age of 65 and became 100% vested in the plan. Therefore, he began receiving the supplemental retirement benefit due to him. He\nreceived $250,000 of this benefit during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. An expense of $84,787, $97,449 and $109,140 was accrued for 2023, 2022 and 2021\nfor this plan, respectively.\n141\nTable of Contents\n16. Related Party Transactions\nIn the ordinary course of business, loans may be made to officers and directors and their affiliated companies at substantially the same terms as comparable\ntransactions with other borrowers. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, related party loans were approximately $63.2 million and $76.5 million, respectively. New\nloans and advances on prior commitments made to the related parties were $662,000 and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Repayments of loans made by the related parties were $11.0 million and $9.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, directors, officers, and other related interest parties had demand, non-interest-bearing deposits of approximately $4.3 million\nand $7.7 million, respectively, savings and interest-bearing transaction accounts of approximately $11.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively, and time\ncertificates of deposit of approximately $878,000 and $390,000, respectively.\nDuring each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, rent expense totaling approximately $139,000, $137,000 and $143,000, respectively, was paid to related parties.\n17. Leases\nThe Company leases land and office facilities under long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The leases expire at various dates through 2044 and\ndo not include renewal options based on economic factors that would have implied that continuation of the lease was reasonably certain. Certain leases provide for\nincreases in future minimum annual rental payments as defined in the lease agreements. The leases generally include real estate taxes and common area\nmaintenance (“CAM”) charges in the rental payments. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less. The Company does not separate\nnonlease components from the associated lease component of our operating leases. As a result, the Company accounts for these components as a single component\nunder Topic 842 since (i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease components and the associated lease component are the same and (ii) the lease\ncomponent, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not\nrecord a related right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and liability for such leases. In addition, equipment leases were determined to be immaterial and a related ROU asset\nand liability for such leases is not recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balances of the ROU asset and lease liability were $42.2 million and $45.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the\nbalances of the ROU asset and lease liability were $42.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively.

Significant Estimates and Concentrations of Credit Risks\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require disclosure of certain significant estimates and current vulnerabilities due to\ncertain concentrations. Estimates related to the allowance for credit losses and certain concentrations of credit risk are reflected in Note 5, while deposit\nconcentrations are reflected in Note 8.\nThe Company’s primary market areas are in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, South Alabama and New York. The Company primarily grants loans to customers\nlocated within these markets unless the borrower has an established relationship with the Company.\nThe diversity of the Company’s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment. Although the Company has a loan portfolio that is diversified in\nboth industry and geographic area, a substantial portion of its debtors’ ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon real estate values, tourism demand and the\neconomic conditions prevailing in its market areas.\nAlthough the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, commercial real estate loans represented 56.7% and 56.3% of total\nloans receivable, respectively, and 215.5% and 230.1% of total stockholders’ equity, respectively. Residential real estate loans represented 15.8% and 16.1% of total\nloans receivable and 60.1% and 66.0% of total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nApproximately 79.8% of the Company’s total loans and 84.6% of the Company’s real estate loans as of December 31, 2023, are to borrowers whose collateral\nis located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Texas and New York, the states in which the Company has its branch locations.\nAny future volatility in the economy could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material\nfuture adjustments in asset values, the allowance for credit losses and capital that could negatively impact the Company’s ability to meet regulatory capital\nrequirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\n143\nTable of Contents\n19. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company makes various commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities to fulfill the financing needs of their\ncustomers. These commitments and contingent liabilities include lines of credit and commitments to extend credit and issue standby letters of credit. The Company\napplies the same credit policies and standards as they do in the lending process when making these commitments. The collateral obtained is based on the assessed\ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, commitments to extend credit of $4.59 billion and $4.83 billion, respectively, were outstanding. A percentage of these\nbalances are participated out to other banks; therefore, the Company can call on the participating banks to fund future draws. Since some of these commitments are\nexpected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOutstanding standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the Company, generally to guarantee the performance of a customer in third-party\nborrowing arrangements. The term of the guarantee is dependent upon the creditworthiness of the borrower, some of which are long-term. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable,\ninventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. Management uses the same credit policies in granting lines of credit as\nit does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, is $185.5 million and $184.6 million, respectively.\nThe Company and/or its bank subsidiary have various unrelated legal proceedings, most of which involve loan foreclosure activity pending, which, in the\naggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations or cash flows of the Company and its subsidiary.\n20. Financial Instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three\nlevels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that\nare not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the assets or liabilities\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Transfers of\nfinancial instruments between levels within the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the date management determines that the underlying circumstances or\nassumptions have changed.\nAvailable-for-sale securities - the Company's available-for-sale securities are considered to be Level 2 securities. The Level 2 securities consist primarily of\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities plus state and political subdivisions. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value\nmeasurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash\nflows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and\nconditions, among other things.\nThe Company reviews the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to\nensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. In general, the Company does not purchase investment portfolio securities with complicated\nstructures. Pricing for the Company’s investment securities is fairly generic and is easily obtained. The Company uses a third-party comparison pricing vendor in\norder to reflect consistency in the fair values of the investment securities sampled by the Company each quarter.\n144\nTable of Contents\nHeld-to-maturity securities – the Company's held-to-maturity securities are considered to be Level 2 securities. The Level 2 securities consist primarily of U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities plus state and political subdivisions. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value\nmeasurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash\nflows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and\nconditions, among other things.\nImpaired loans - Impaired loans include loans individually analyzed for credit losses for which a specific reserve has been recorded, non-accrual loans, loans\npast due 90 days or more and restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Impaired loans are carried at the net realizable value of the\ncollateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for credit losses is allocated to impaired loans if the value of such loans is deemed to be less\nthan the unpaid balance. If these allocations cause the allowance for credit losses to require an increase, such increase is reported as a component of the provision\nfor credit losses. The fair value of loans with specific allocated losses was $10.5 million and $168.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This\nvaluation is considered Level 3, consisting of appraisals of underlying collateral. The Company reversed $2.4 million and $1.1 million of accrued interest\nreceivable when impaired loans were put on non-accrual status during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nForeclosed assets held for sale - Foreclosed assets held for sale are held by the Company at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At foreclosure, if the fair\nvalue, less estimated costs to sell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company’s recorded investment in the related loan, a write-down is recognized through\na charge to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management and any subsequent reduction in value is recognized\nby a charge to income. The fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale is estimated using Level 3 inputs based on appraisals of underlying collateral. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale, less estimated costs to sell, was $30.5 million and $546,000, respectively.\nNo foreclosed assets held for sale were remeasured during the year ended December 31, 2023. No foreclosed assets held for sale were remeasured during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. Regulatory guidelines require the Company to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale on at least an annual basis.\nThe Company’s policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines.\nThe significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans and foreclosed assets\nprimarily relate to customized discounting criteria applied to the customer’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends upon the\ncondition and marketability of the underlying collateral. As the Company’s primary objective in the event of default would be to monetize the collateral to settle the\noutstanding balance of the loan, less marketable collateral would receive a larger discount.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date.\n145\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying\nAmount Fair Value Level\n(In thousands)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,000,213 $ 1,000,213 1\nInvestment securities - available for sale 3,507,841 3,507,841 2\nInvestment securities - held-to-maturity 1,281,982 1,170,481 2\nLoans receivable, net of impaired loans and allowance 14,048,002 14,071,775 3\nAccrued interest receivable 118,966 118,966 1\nFHLB, FRB & FNBB stock; other equity investments 223,748 223,748 3\nMarketable equity securities 49,419 49,419 1\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits:\nDemand and non-interest bearing $ 4,085,501 $ 4,085,501 1\nSavings and interest-bearing transaction accounts 11,050,347 11,050,347 1\nTime deposits 1,651,863 1,633,091 3\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 142,085 142,085 1\nFHLB and other borrowed funds 1,301,300 1,291,926 2\nAccrued interest payable 19,124 19,124 1\nSubordinated debentures 439,834 358,682 3\nDecember 31, 2022\nCarrying\nAmount Fair Value Level\n(In thousands)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 724,790 $ 724,790 1\nInvestment securities - available for sale 4,041,590 4,041,590 2\nInvestment securities - held-to-maturity 1,287,705 1,126,146 2\nLoans receivable, net of impaired loans and allowance 13,929,892 13,723,865 3\nAccrued interest receivable 103,199 103,199 1\nFHLB, FRB & FNBB stock; other equity investments 215,952 215,952 3\nMarketable equity securities 52,034 52,034 1\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits:\nDemand and non-interest bearing $ 5,164,997 $ 5,164,997 1\nSavings and interest-bearing transaction accounts 11,730,552 11,730,552 1\nTime deposits 1,043,234 1,014,348 3\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 131,146 131,146 1\nFHLB and other borrowed funds 650,000 595,886 2\nAccrued interest payable 10,622 10,622 1\nSubordinated debentures 440,420 411,686 3\n146\nTable of Contents\n21. Regulatory Matters\nThe Bank is subject to a legal limitation on dividends that can be paid to the parent company without prior approval of the applicable regulatory agencies.\nArkansas bank regulators have specified that the maximum dividend limit state banks may pay to the parent company without prior approval is 75% of the current\nyear earnings plus 75% of the retained net earnings of the preceding year. Since the Bank is also under supervision of the Federal Reserve, it is further limited if the\ntotal of all dividends declared in any calendar year by the Bank exceeds the Bank’s net profits to date for that year combined with its retained net profits for the\npreceding two years. During 2023, the Company requested approximately $328.9 million in regular dividends from its banking subsidiary.\nThe Company’s banking subsidiary is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action,\nthe Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators\nabout components, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, the Company’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, common\nequity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as\ndefined). Management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nOn December 31, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and\nbanks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of\nits response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to\ntemporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding\ncompanies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit\nlosses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the risk-based capital ratios presented below.\nBasel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a\nCET1 capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt\ncorrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a 4.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio and an 8% total risk-based capital ratio.\nThe Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital guidelines include the definitions for (1) a well-capitalized institution, (2) an adequately-capitalized institution,\nand (3) an undercapitalized institution. Under Basel III, the criteria for a well-capitalized institution are now: a 6.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 5% Tier 1\nleverage ratio, an 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and a 10% total risk-based capital ratio. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank met the capital standards for a\nwell-capitalized institution. The Company’s CET1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio\nwere 14.15%, 12.44%, 14.15%, and 17.79%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\n147\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s actual capital amounts and ratios along with the Company’s bank subsidiary are presented in the following table.\nMinimum To Be Well-Capitalized\nMinimum Capital Requirement – Under Prompt Corrective Action\nActual Basel III Provision\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,609,823 14.15 % $ 1,290,867 7.00 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,495,303 13.60 1,284,347 7.00 1,192,608 6.50\nLeverage ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,609,823 12.44 % $ 839,271 4.00 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,495,303 11.92 837,350 4.00 1,046,688 5.00\nTier 1 capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,609,823 14.15 % $ 1,567,482 8.50 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,495,303 13.60 1,559,564 8.50 1,467,825 8.00\nTotal risk-based capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 3,281,136 17.79 % $ 1,936,301 10.50 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,725,909 14.85 1,927,410 10.50 1,835,629 10.00\nAs of December 31, 2022\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,399,919 12.91 % $ 1,300,831 7.00 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,408,756 13.00 1,297,352 7.00 1,204,684 6.50\nLeverage ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,399,919 10.86 % $ 883,664 4.00 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,408,756 10.93 881,464 4.00 1,101,831 5.00\nTier 1 capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 2,399,919 12.91 % $ 1,579,580 8.50 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,408,756 13.00 1,575,356 8.50 1,482,688 8.00\nTotal risk-based capital ratios:\nHome BancShares $ 3,073,455 16.54 % $ 1,951,246 10.50 % N/A N/A\nCentennial Bank 2,640,992 14.25 1,946,021 10.50 1,853,354 10.00\n22.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in the update\nsimplify the accounting for income taxes by removing the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing\noperations and income or a gain from other items and the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-\ndate loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments in the update also simplify the accounting for income taxes by requiring that an entity recognize\na franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based\ntax, requiring that an entity evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which the book goodwill\nwas originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction, specifying that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of\ncurrent and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements; however, an entity may elect to do so on an entity-by-\nentity basis for a legal entity that is both not subject to tax and disregarded by the taxing authority. The amendments require that an entity reflect the effect of an\nenacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted the\nguidance effective January 1, 2021, and its adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\n150\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,“Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting related to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by\nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or\nanother reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform and do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships\nentered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional\nexpedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. ASU 2020-04 was effective upon issuance and generally could be applied through\nDecember 31, 2022. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place, ASU 2022-06\ndefers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic\n848.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.” The amendments in the update clarify that certain optional\nexpedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition.\nSpecifically, certain provisions in Topic 848, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract\nprice alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. Amendments in the update to the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 capture the\nincremental consequences of the scope clarification and tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. The\namendments in this Update do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31, 2022,\nand existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31,\n2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. ASU 2021-01 was effective\nupon issuance and generally could be applied through December 31, 2022. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant\nnumber of modifications may take place, ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities\nwill no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDR\") and Vintage\nDisclosures (\"ASU 2022-02\"). The amendments eliminate the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, require that an entity evaluate (consistent\nwith the accounting for other loan modifications) whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also\nenhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The amendments require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in\nleases. Gross write-off information must be included in the vintage disclosures required for public business entities, which requires that an entity disclose the\namortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. ASU 2022-02 is effective for\nentities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. These amendments should be applied prospectively. The Company\nadopted the guidance effective January 1, 2023 and elected to apply the amendments prospectively. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial\nposition.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.\" These amendments extend\nthe period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide relief during\nthe temporary transition period, so the FASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) would cease being published. In 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the intended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR\nto June 30, 2023. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place, the ASU defers the\nsunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. ASU\n2022-06 was effective upon issuance.\n151\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The amendments\napply to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments in the\nASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\namendments require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. Public entities are required to disclose, on an annual and interim\nbasis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In addition, public entities must provide all annual disclosures\nabout a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, in interim periods. The amendments clarify\nthat if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public\nentity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single\nreported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding\namounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements. The Amendments require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.\nFinally, the amendments require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the ASU and all\nexisting segment disclosures in ASC Topic 280. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment\nexpense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impacts related to the adoption of the\nASU.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" The amendments require that\npublic business entities on an annual basis (a) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (b) provide additional information for reconciling items that\nmeet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income [or\nloss] by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The amendments also require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of\nrefunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by\nindividual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds\nreceived). The amendments require that all entities disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated\nbetween domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. The ASU is\neffective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have\nnot yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company\nis currently evaluating the potential impacts related to the adoption of the ASU.\nItem 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNo items are reportable.\nItem 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nAn evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures,”\nwhich are defined under SEC rules as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a\ncompany in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective. As a result of this evaluation, there were no significant changes in the Company’s disclosure controls or in other factors that\ncould significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of evaluation.\n152\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe information required by Item 308(a) and 308(b) of Regulation S-K regarding management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and\nthe audit report of the independent registered public accounting firm is contained in “Item 8.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting\nduring the Company’s fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

(the “Company”) and certain provisions of the Company’s Restated Articles of\nIncorporation, as amended (“Articles of Incorporation”), Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), and certain provisions of applicable law. The\nfollowing is only a summary and is qualified by applicable law and by the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which have\nbeen filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are also available upon request from the Company.\nGeneral\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation we have authority to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and up to 5,500,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Each share of our common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other\nshare of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 201,526,494 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and 5,413,912 shares of common stock were reserved for\nissuance pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The outstanding shares of our common\nstock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no shares of our preferred stock were issued and outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nVoting Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights.\nDividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for\nthe payment of dividends. Holders of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future may have a priority over holders of common stock with respect to\ndividends. The payment of dividends is subject to government regulation, in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from\npaying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if doing so would\nreduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements. State laws also limit a bank’s ability to pay dividends.\nAccordingly, the dividend restrictions imposed on our bank subsidiary by statute or regulation effectively may limit the amount of dividends we can pay.\nLiquidation and Dissolution. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, the holders of our common stock are entitled to\nreceive ratably all of the assets of the Company available for distribution after satisfaction of all liabilities of the Company, subject to the rights of the holders of\nany of the Company’s preferred shares that may be issued from time to time.\nOther Rights. Holders of our common stock have no preferential or preemptive rights with respect to any securities of the Company, and there are no\nconversion rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock.\nRestrictions on Ownership. The Bank Holding Company Act (the “BHCA”) requires any “bank holding company,” as defined in the BHCA, to obtain the\napproval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve prior to the acquisition of 5% or more of our common stock. Any “company,” as defined in the BHCA,\nother than a bank holding company would be required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring “control” of us. “Control” generally means (i) the\nownership or control of 25% or more of a class of voting securities, (ii) the ability to elect a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a\ncontrolling influence over our management and policies. A holder of 25% or more of our outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to\nregulation and supervision as a bank holding company under the BHCA. In addition, under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, and the Federal\nReserve’s regulations thereunder, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, is required to provide notice to the\nFederal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nModification of Rights. Our board of directors acting by a majority vote of the members present, without shareholder approval, may amend our Bylaws and\nmay issue shares of our preferred stock under terms determined by the board of directors as described below under “Preferred Stock.” Rights of holders of our\ncommon stock may not otherwise be modified except by a majority of votes cast, assuming a quorum is present. Additionally, under the Arkansas Business\nCorporation Act of 1987, a majority vote is required for the approval of a merger or consolidation with another corporation, and for the sale of all or substantially\nall of our assets and dissolution of the Company.\nTransfer Agent. The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare, 150 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts 02021.\nPreferred Stock\nThe 5,500,000 shares of our preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, are typically referred to as “blank check” preferred stock. This term means that these\nshares of preferred stock may be issued with such preferences, limitations, relative rights, and terms as determined by our board of directors. As such, the board of\ndirectors can, without shareholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion rights that could dilute the voting strength of\nthe holders of the common stock and may assist management in impeding an unfriendly takeover or attempted change in control.\nThe Company has no present plans to issue any shares of its preferred stock.\nExhibit 21.1\nHOME BANCSHARES, INC.\nDIRECT AND INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\nState of Incorporation/\nName of Subsidiary Organization\nCentennial Bank Arkansas\nCentennial Insurance Agency, Inc. d/b/a Insurance Mart, Inc.

Davis\nBrian S. Davis\nChief Financial Officer\nExhibit 97.1\nHOME BANCSHARES, INC.\nCLAWBACK POLICY\nI. Purpose\nIn accordance with the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) and Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Home BancShares, Inc. (the “Company”) adopts this Clawback\nPolicy (the “Policy”) to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from executive officers in the event of an accounting\nrestatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws.\nII. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (“CLDC”) of the Board (the “Committee”) or, if so designated by\nthe Committee or in the absence of a Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors, the independent directors of the Board, in which case\nreferences herein to the Committee shall be deemed references to such independent directors. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and\nbinding on all Covered Executives (as defined below).\nIII. Covered Executives\nThis Policy applies to all current and former officers of the Company who are or were subject to reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act\n(collectively, “Covered Executives”). Covered Executives shall include, without limitation, all officers identified as executive officers in the Company’s annual\nproxy statement pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.\nIV. Recovery; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Committee will recover reasonably promptly any excess Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation\n(defined below). For purposes of this Policy, “accounting restatement” includes any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the\ncurrent period or left uncorrected in the current period.\nV. Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means any compensation granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial\nreporting measure.\nFinancial reporting measures are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. For purposes of this Policy, stock price and total shareholder return are\ndeemed financial reporting measures.\n“Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation” means Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive: (i) on or after October 2, 2023; (ii) after\nbeginning service as a Covered Executive; (iii) who served as an Covered Executive at any time during the applicable performance period relating to any Incentive\nCompensation; and (iv) during the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of\nthe Company authorized to take such action if the Board action is not required, concludes the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement.\nIncentive Compensation is deemed received in the fiscal period during which the specified financial reporting measure is attained, even if the payment, grant or\nvesting of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nVI. Excess Incentive Compensation; Amounts Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered with respect to each Covered Executive will be the amount of Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of\nIncentive Compensation the Covered Executive otherwise would have received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, as determined by the\nCommittee and computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nIf the Committee cannot determine the amount of excess Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the\ninformation in the accounting restatement, the Committee shall make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\nThe Committee shall document its determination of such reasonable\nestimate and, if necessary, provide such documentation to the NYSE in accordance with applicable requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\nVII. Method of Recovery\nThe Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation hereunder, which may include, without\nlimitation:\n• Requiring reimbursement of cash Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n• Seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n• Offsetting the recovered amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n• Cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n• Taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee.\nVIII. No Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any erroneously awarded Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation.\nIX. Interpretation\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this\nPolicy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable\nrules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the NYSE.\nX. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”).\nXI. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with any rules or standards\nadopted by the NYSE or by the SEC under Section 10D of the Exchange Act. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\nXII. Other Recovery Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee may require that any cash bonus plan or award, equity incentive\nplan or award agreement, or other compensation agreement adopted, made or entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any\nbenefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy.\nAny right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant\nto the terms of any similar policy or provision in any annual cash bonus plan or award, employment agreement, equity incentive plan or award agreement, or\nsimilar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\nXIII. Impracticability\nThe Committee shall recover any excess Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable,\nas determined by the Committee in accordance with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and the applicable NYSE listing rules."

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future financial\nperformance, future plans and strategies, and anticipated events or trends, and include statements about the competitiveness of the banking industry, potential\nregulatory obligations, our entrance and expansion into other markets, including through potential acquisitions, our other business strategies and other\nstatements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results. When we use words like “may,” “plan,”\n“contemplate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “continue,” “expect,” “project,” “predict,” “estimate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” and similar expressions,\nyou should consider them as identifying forward-looking statements, although we may use other phrasing. These forward-looking statements involve risks and\nuncertainties and are based on our beliefs and assumptions, and on the information available to us at the time that these disclosures were prepared. These\nforward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• the effects of future local, regional, national and international economic conditions, including inflation or a decrease in commercial real estate and\nresidential housing values;\n• changes in the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, and credit risk generally;\n• the risks of changes in interest rates or the level and composition of deposits, loan demand and the values of loan collateral, securities and interest-\nsensitive assets and liabilities;\n• disruptions, uncertainties and related effects on credit quality, liquidity, other aspects of our business and our operations that may result from any\nfuture public health crises;\n• the ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate new acquisitions;\n• the risk that expected cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\n• diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues;\n• the availability of and access to capital and liquidity on terms acceptable to us;\n• increased regulatory requirements and supervision that applies as a result of our having over $10 billion in total assets;\n• legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and the Company and its subsidiaries in particular, and future legislative\nand regulatory changes;\n• changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies;\n• the effects of terrorism and efforts to combat it, political instability, war, military conflicts (including the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East\nand Ukraine) and other major domestic or international events;\n• the impacts of recent or future adverse weather events, including hurricanes, and other natural disasters;\n• the ability to keep pace with technological changes, including changes regarding cybersecurity;\n• an increase in the incidence or severity of, or any adverse effects resulting from, acts of fraud, illegal payments, cybersecurity breaches or other illegal\nacts impacting our bank subsidiary, our vendors or our customers;\n• the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities\nbrokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in our market area and\nelsewhere, including institutions operating regionally, nationally and internationally, together with competitors offering banking products and services\nby mail, telephone and the Internet;\n• potential claims, expenses and other adverse effects related to current or future litigation, regulatory examinations or other government actions;\n• potential increases in deposit insurance assessments, increased regulatory scrutiny, investment portfolio losses, or market disruptions resulting from\nfinancial challenges in the banking industry;\n• the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and auditing requirements, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters;\n• higher defaults on our loan portfolio than we expect; and\nTable of Contents\n• the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of our allowance for credit losses or changes in our estimate of the adequacy of the allowance\nfor credit losses.\nAll written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this Cautionary Note. Our actual results may\ndiffer significantly from those we discuss in these forward-looking statements. For other factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from estimates and projections contained in these forward-looking statements, see the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 26, 2024 and this Form 10-Q.\nTable of Contents\nPART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1:

(the “Company” or “HBI”) is a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas. The Company is primarily engaged in\nproviding a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through its wholly-owned community bank subsidiary – Centennial Bank\n(sometimes referred to as “Centennial” or the “Bank”). The Bank has branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama, Texas and New York City. The\nCompany is subject to competition from other financial institutions. The Company also is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and\nundergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.\nA summary of the significant accounting policies of the Company follows:\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)J (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief\noperating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Bank is the only significant subsidiary upon which\nmanagement makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Each of the branches of the Bank provides a group of similar\nbanking services, including such products and services as commercial, real estate and consumer loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts. The\nindividual bank branches have similar operating and economic characteristics. While the chief decision maker monitors the revenue streams of the various\nproducts, services and branch locations, operations are managed, and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the\nbanking services and branch locations are considered by management to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment.\n(cid:0)8 (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of\ninvestment securities, the valuation of foreclosed assets and the valuations of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in business combinations. In connection\nwith the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of foreclosed assets, management obtains independent appraisals for significant\nproperties.\n(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HBI and its subsidiaries.

Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based\non the principal balance outstanding. Loan origination fees and direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as adjustments to yield on the related\nloans.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is\nconfirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards,\nportfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross\ndomestic product, national retail sales index, FHFA housing price index and rental vacancy rate index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan\nsegments are as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - Shore Premier Finance (\"SPF\")\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans evaluated individually that are\nconsidered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of\nestimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the\ncollateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows\nfrom the operation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the\namortized cost basis of the loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent, an\nallowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate. The\ncontractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n• Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be\nexecuted with an individual borrower.\n• The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by\nthe Company.\n11\nTable of Contents\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in\nassessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors (\"Q-Factors\") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be\nconsidered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and\nstrategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and\nnonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment;\n(viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system; and (ix) economic conditions.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower’s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and\nbusiness conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are\ncharged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-\naccrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the\ncurrent year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are\nusually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the\ncustomer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are purchase credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. An\nallowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The Company develops separate PCD models for each loan segment with\nPCD loans not individually analyzed for credit losses. These models utilize a peer group benchmark in order to determine the probability of default and loss\ngiven default to be used in the calculation. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The\ndifference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income\nover the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses.\nFor further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)% (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to\nextend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability\nmanagement strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and\nother similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a\nprovision for credit losses. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security\nbefore recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written\ndown to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from\ncredit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the\nrating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a\ncredit loss exists, the present value of cash flows\n15\nTable of Contents\nexpected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is\nless than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value\nis less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued\ninterest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss\nexpense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nDebt securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported\nat historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted to the call date to interest\nincome using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any\nsecurities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses. The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by\nmajor security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is\nadjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM\nsecurities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses\nare recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a\nsecurity is confirmed.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recovered $330,000 in AFS reserves due to an improvement in the unrealized loss position of\none of the Company's subordinated debt investments. For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined the $2.0\nmillion allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio was adequate. Therefore, no additional provision was considered necessary for the HTM\nportfolio.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAllowance for credit losses: (In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 2,525 $ 842\n(Recovery of) provision for credit loss (330) 1,683\nBalance, September 30 $ 2,195 $ 2,525\nProvision for credit loss —\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 2,525\nHeld-to-Maturity Investment Securities\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAllowance for credit losses: (In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 2,005 $ 2,005\nProvision for credit loss — —\nBalance, September 30 $ 2,005 $ 2,005\nProvision for credit loss —\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 2,005\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had available-for-sale investment securities with approximately $261.8 million in unrealized\nlosses, of which $260.1 million had been in continuous loss positions for more than twelve months. With the exception of the subordinated debt investment\nsecurities which were downgraded during 2023 resulting in the allowance, the Company’s assessments indicated the cause of the market depreciation was\nprimarily due to the change in interest rates and not the issuer’s financial condition or downgrades by rating agencies. In addition, approximately 38.6% of the\nprincipal balance from the Company’s investment portfolio will mature or are expected to pay down within five years or less. As a result, the Company has the\nability and intent to hold such securities until maturity.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted of 1,550 investment securities, 1,256 of which were in an\nunrealized loss position. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was $261.8 million. The U.S. government-sponsored enterprises\nportfolio contained unrealized losses of $11.2 million on 54 securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained $150.1\nmillion of unrealized losses on 645 securities, and the private mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained $9.1 million of unrealized losses on 31 securities.\nThe non-government-sponsored asset backed securities portfolio contained $2.9 million of unrealized losses on 24 securities. The state and political\nsubdivisions portfolio contained $66.8 million of unrealized losses on 439 securities. In addition, the other securities portfolio contained $21.7 million of\nunrealized losses on 63 securities. With the exception of the investments for which an allowance for credit losses has been established, the unrealized losses on\nthe Company's investments were primarily a result of interest rate changes, and the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the\nsecurities. The Company has determined that, as of September 30, 2024, an additional provision for credit losses is not necessary because the decline in market\nvalue was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more\nlikely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's held-to-maturity securities portfolio consisted of 510 investment securities, 488 of which were in an unrealized\nloss position. As noted in the table above, the total amount of the unrealized loss was $83.6 million. The U.S. government-sponsored enterprises portfolio\ncontained unrealized losses of $1.7 million on 5 securities. The U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities portfolio contained unrealized losses of\n$2.3 million on 12 securities. The state and political subdivisions portfolio contained $79.6 million of unrealized losses on 471 securities. The unrealized losses\non the Company's investments were a result of interest rate changes. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities.\nBecause the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company has determined that an additional\nprovision for credit losses was not necessary as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes bond ratings for the Company’s held-to-maturity portfolio, based upon amortized cost, issued by state and political\nsubdivisions and other securities as of September 30, 2024:\nU.S. government-\nState and political U.S. government- sponsored mortgage-\nsubdivisions sponsored enterprises backed securities Total\n(In thousands)\nAaa/AAA $ 238,872 $ 43,490 $ — $ 282,362\nAa/AA 845,788 — — 845,788\nA 23,200 — — 23,200\nNot rated 1,825 — — 1,825\nAgency Backed — — 125,920 125,920\nTotal $ 1,109,685 $ 43,490 $ 125,920 $ 1,279,095\nIncome earned on securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:\nThree Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nTaxable\nAvailable-for-sale $ 23,550 $ 27,028 $ 74,439 $ 82,080\nHeld-to-maturity 7,456 7,492 22,383 22,479\nNon-taxable\nAvailable-for-sale 4,612 4,746 13,971 14,369\nHeld-to-maturity 3,092 3,122 9,305 9,394\nTotal $ 38,710 $ 42,388 $ 120,098 $ 128,322\n17\nTable of Contents\n4.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold $1.0 million guaranteed\nportions of certain SBA loans, which resulted in a gain of approximately $97,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold $3.2\nmillion guaranteed portions of certain SBA loans, which resulted in a gain of approximately $236,000.\nMortgage loans held for sale of approximately $92.0 million and $123.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included\nin residential 1-4 family loans. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, determined using an aggregate basis. Gains and losses\nresulting from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the respective loans are sold to investors. Gains and losses are determined by the difference\nbetween the selling price and the carrying amount of the loans sold, net of discounts collected or paid. The Company obtains forward commitments to sell\nmortgage loans to reduce market risk on mortgage loans in the process of origination and mortgage loans held for sale. The forward commitments acquired by\nthe Company for mortgage loans in process of origination are considered mandatory forward commitments. Because these commitments are structured on a\nmandatory basis, the Company is required to substitute another loan or to buy back the commitment if the original loan does not fund. The Company regularly\nsells mortgages into the capital markets to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility during the period from the time an interest rate lock commitment\n(“IRLC”) is issued until the IRLC funds creating a mortgage loan held for sale and its subsequent sale into the secondary/capital markets. Loan sales are\ntypically executed on a mandatory basis. Under a mandatory commitment, the Company agrees to deliver a specified dollar amount with predetermined terms\nby a certain date. Generally, the commitment is not loan specific, and any combination of loans can be delivered into the outstanding commitment provided the\nterms fall within the parameters of the commitment. Upon failure to deliver, the Company is subject to fees based on market movement. These commitments\nand IRLCs are derivative instruments and their fair values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.\n18\nTable of Contents\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is\ndetermined using the same methodology as other loans. The Company develops separate PCD models for each loan segment with PCD loans not individually\nanalyzed for credit losses. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s\npurchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value\nof the loan is a non-credit discount or premium which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit\nlosses are recorded through the provision for credit losses. The Company held approximately $79.6 million and $130.7 million in PCD loans, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance, as of September 30, 2024, results entirely from the acquisition of Happy.\nA description of our accounting policies for loans and impaired loans (which includes loans individually analyzed for credit losses for which a specific\nreserve has been recorded, non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty) are set\nforth in our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\n5. Allowance for Credit Losses, Credit Quality and Other\nThe Company uses the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to estimate expected losses for all of the Company’s loan pools. These pools are as follows:\nconstruction & land development; other commercial real estate; residential real estate; commercial & industrial; and consumer & other. The loan portfolio\npools were selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial\nInstitutions Examination Council. For each of these loan pools, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment\nexpectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of\nexpected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on historical internal data. The Company uses regression analysis of historical\ninternal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also\ndetermines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors (\"Q-Factors\") that are not considered within our modeling processes but are, nonetheless,\nrelevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be\nconsidered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and\nstrategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and\nnonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment;\n(viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system; and (ix) economic conditions.\nEach year management evaluates the performance of the selected models used in the CECL calculation through backtesting. Based on the results of the\ntesting, management determines if the various models produced accurate results compared to the actual losses incurred for the current economic environment.\nManagement then determines if changes to the input assumptions and economic factors would produce a stronger overall calculation that is more responsive to\nchanges in economic conditions. The Company continues to use regression analysis to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime\nprobability of default and loss given default for the changes in the economic factors for the loss driver segments. Based on this analysis, management\ndetermined that changes to several of the economic factors for the loss driver segments, along with other model improvements and updates, were necessary,\nand updated models were implemented beginning with the June 30, 2024 allowance for credit losses calculation. The identified loss drivers by segment are\nincluded below as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n19\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLoss Driver Segment Call Report Segment(s) Modeled Economic Factors\n1-4 Family Construction 1a1 National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index (%)\nAll Other Construction 1a2 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nFarmland & Agriculture 1b, 3 National Unemployment (%)\nResidential 1-4 Family 1c1, 1c2a, 1c2b National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index (%)\nMultifamily 1d Rental Vacancy Rate (%) & Housing Price Index (%)\nNon-Farm/ Non-Residential CRE 1e1, 1e2 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nCommercial & Industrial, Non-Depository Financial Institutions,\n4a, 9a, 9b1, 9b2, 10, Other National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nPurchase/Carry Securities, Leases, Other\nConsumer Auto 6c National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer 6b, 6d National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer - SPF 6d National Unemployment (%)\nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions 8 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nDecember 31, 2023\nLoss Driver Segment Call Report Segment(s) Modeled Economic Factors\n1-4 Family Construction 1a1 National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index (%)\nAll Other Construction 1a2 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\n1-4 Family Revolving HELOC & Junior Liens 1c1 National Unemployment (%) & Housing Price Index – CoreLogic (%)\n1-4 Family Revolving HELOC & Junior Liens 1c2b National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\n1-4 Family Senior Liens 1c2a National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nMultifamily 1d Rental Vacancy Rate (%) & Housing Price Index – Case-Schiller (%)\nOwner Occupied CRE 1e1 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nNon-Owner Occupied CRE 1e2,1b,8 National Unemployment (%) & Gross Domestic Product (%)\nCommercial & Industrial, Agricultural, Non-Depository Financial\n4a, 3, 9a, 9b1, 9b2, 10, Other National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nInstitutions, Purchase/Carry Securities, Other\nConsumer Auto 6c National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer 6b, 6d National Unemployment (%) & National Retail Sales (%)\nOther Consumer - SPF 6d National Unemployment (%)\nFor all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss\nrate over four quarters on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss\ndriver forecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when\ndeveloping the forecast metrics.\nThe combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and time expectations (prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery) produces\nan expected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument\nexpected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present value of expected cash flows (“NPV”). An allowance\nfor credit loss is established for the difference between the instrument’s NPV and amortized cost basis.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:18)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)2 (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)( (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) We originate non-farm and non-residential loans (primarily secured by\ncommercial real estate), construction/land development loans, and agricultural loans, which are generally secured by real estate located in our market areas.\nOur commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized (where defined) over a 15 to 30 year period with balloon\npayments due at the end of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by assessing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary\nsource of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management experience,\nownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, we will loan up to 85% of the value of improved property, 65%\nof the value of raw land and 75% of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the\ncollateral is rental property, with second lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis.\n20\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market\nareas.

The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current\nfinancial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow\n(debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage,\nmanagement experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of\ncollateral. Generally, accounts receivable are financed at between 50% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will\nrange between 50% and 80% (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) Our consumer & other loans are primarily composed of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats.

The allowance for credit loss on off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur\nand an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company uses the DCF method to estimate\nexpected losses for all of the Company’s off-balance sheet credit exposures through the use of the existing DCF models for the Company’s loan portfolio pools.\nThe off-balance sheet credit exposures exhibit similar risk characteristics as loans currently in the Company’s loan portfolio.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $18.2 million and $31.7 million in provision for credit losses on\nloans, respectively. $16.7 million of the provision for credit losses recorded during 2024 was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the third quarter of 2024. In\naddition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $1.0 million in provision for unfunded commitments, which completely\noffset the $1.0 million recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments that was recorded during the first quarter of 2024. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $2.8 million and $6.3 million in provision for credit losses on loans, respectively. For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the Company recovered $1.5 million in credit losses on unfunded commitments.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nConstruction/ Other\nLand Commercial Residential Commercial Consumer\nDevelopment Real Estate Real Estate & Industrial & Other Total\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 58,673 $ 86,842 $ 51,354 $ 69,635 $ 29,352 $ 295,856\nLoans charged off — — (42) (741) (1,218) (2,001)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 7 34 54 143 281 519\nNet loans recovered (charged off) 7 34 12 (598) (937) (1,482)\nProvision for credit losses 4,718 9,799 8,059 (8,434) 4,058 18,200\nBalance, September 30 $ 63,398 $ 96,675 $ 59,425 $ 60,603 $ 32,473 $ 312,574\n21\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nConstruction/ Other\nLand Commercial Residential Commercial Consumer\nDevelopment Real Estate Real Estate & Industrial & Other Total\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 33,877 $ 78,635 $ 55,860 $ 92,810 $ 27,052 $ 288,234\nLoans charged off (81) (1,164) (260) (4,500) (3,072) (9,077)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 96 59 149 503 910 1,717\nNet loans recovered (charged off) 15 (1,105) (111) (3,997) (2,162) (7,360)\nProvision for credit losses 29,506 19,145 3,676 (28,210) 7,583 31,700\nBalance, September 30 $ 63,398 $ 96,675 $ 59,425 $ 60,603 $ 32,473 $ 312,574\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company implemented updated allowance for credit loss models as part of the annual model review and challenge\nprocess.

For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the\ncollateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided\nsubstantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the\ncollateral, net of estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the\noperation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of\nexpected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated\nas the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less\n24\nTable of Contents\nestimated costs to sell. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of\nthe loan, net of estimated costs to sell.\nThe following is an aging analysis for loans receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAccruing\nLoans Loans\nLoans Loans Past Due Total Past Due\nPast Due Past Due 90 Days Total Current Loans 90 Days\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days or More Past Due Loans Receivable or More\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 4,391 $ 837 $ 48,795 $ 54,023 $ 5,442,513 $ 5,496,536 $ 709\nConstruction/land development 778 221 6,060 7,059 2,734,360 2,741,419 657\nAgricultural 177 198 737 1,112 334,853 335,965 —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 2,329 6,698 25,400 34,427 1,897,925 1,932,352 1,495\nMultifamily residential 20,902 — 592 21,494 461,154 482,648 —\nTotal real estate 28,577 7,954 81,584 118,115 10,870,805 10,988,920 2,861\nConsumer 2,928 155 7,529 10,612 1,208,585 1,219,197 28\nCommercial and industrial 1,071 567 10,916 12,554 2,072,113 2,084,667 2,405\nAgricultural & other 1,120 91 1,074 2,285 528,910 531,195 62\nTotal $ 33,696 $ 8,767 $ 101,103 $ 143,566 $ 14,680,413 $ 14,823,979 $ 5,356\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccruing\nLoans Loans\nLoans Loans Past Due Total Past Due\nPast Due Past Due 90 Days Total Current Loans 90 Days\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days or More Past Due Loans Receivable or More\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 8,124 $ 416 $ 15,355 $ 23,895 $ 5,526,059 $ 5,549,954 $ 2,177\nConstruction/land development 1,430 — 12,349 13,779 2,279,268 2,293,047 255\nAgricultural 474 314 431 1,219 323,937 325,156 —\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 4,346 1,423 20,435 26,204 1,818,056 1,844,260 84\nMultifamily residential — — — — 435,736 435,736 —\nTotal real estate 14,374 2,153 48,570 65,097 10,383,056 10,448,153 2,516\nConsumer 1,022 303 3,502 4,827 1,148,863 1,153,690 79\nCommercial and industrial 2,089 3,378 11,517 16,984 2,308,007 2,324,991 1,535\nAgricultural and other 1,074 113 512 1,699 496,195 497,894 —\nTotal $ 18,559 $ 5,947 $ 64,101 $ 88,607 $ 14,336,121 $ 14,424,728 $ 4,130\nNon-accruing loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $95.7 million and $60.0 million, respectively.\nInterest recognized on impaired loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $1.3 million and $3.7 million,\nrespectively.

Loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 8. Descriptions of the general\ncharacteristics of the 8 risk ratings are as follows:\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:17) Loans in this category are to persons or entities of unquestionable financial strength, a highly liquid financial position, with\ncollateral that is liquid and well margined. These borrowers have performed without question on past obligations, and the Bank expects their\nperformance to continue. Internally generated cash flow covers current maturities of long-term debt by a substantial margin. Loans secured by bank\ncertificates of deposit and savings accounts, with appropriate holds placed on the accounts, are to be rated in this category.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)* (cid:0)R (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:17) These are loans to persons or entities with strong financial condition and above-average liquidity that have previously\nsatisfactorily handled their obligations with the Bank. Collateral securing the Bank’s debt is margined in accordance with policy guidelines. Internally\ngenerated cash flow covers current maturities of long-term debt more than adequately. Unsecured loans to individuals supported by strong financial\nstatements and on which repayment is satisfactory may be included in this classification.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)6 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)I(cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:17) Loans to persons or entities with an average financial condition, adequate collateral margins, adequate cash flow to\nservice long-term debt, and net worth comprised mainly of fixed assets are included in this category. These entities are minimally profitable now, with\nprojections indicating continued profitability into the foreseeable future. Closely held corporations or businesses where a majority of the profits are\nwithdrawn by the owners or paid in dividends are included in this rating category. Overall, these loans are basically sound.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0): (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:17) Borrowers who have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability or have experienced an unprofitable year and a declining\nfinancial condition characterize these loans. The borrower has in the past satisfactorily handled debts with the Bank, but in recent months has either\nbeen late, delinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments. While the Bank continues to be adequately secured, margins have decreased or\nare decreasing, despite the borrower’s continued satisfactory condition. Other characteristics of borrowers in this class include inadequate credit\ninformation, weakness of financial statement and repayment capacity, but with collateral that appears to limit exposure.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)V (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)‡ (cid:0)2 (cid:0)/ (cid:0)( (cid:0)0 (cid:0)· (cid:0)(cid:12). A loan criticized as OLEM has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close\nattention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s\ncredit position at some future date. OLEM assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse\nclassification.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:25) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)X (cid:0)E (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:17) A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the\ncollateral pledged. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual assets.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)E (cid:0)W(cid:0)I(cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:17) A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristic\nthat the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and\nimprobable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure\ncollectability in full in a reasonable period of time; in fact, there is permanent impairment in the collateral securing the loan.\n• (cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3) Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as bankable assets is not\nwarranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather, it is not practical or desirable to\ndefer writing off this basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may occur in the future. This classification is based upon current facts, not\nprobabilities. Assets classified as loss should be charged-off in the period in which they became uncollectible.\nThe Company’s classified loans include loans in risk ratings 6, 7 and 8. Loans may be classified, but not considered collateral dependent, due to one of the\nfollowing reasons: (1) The Company has established minimum dollar amount thresholds for credit loss testing. All loans over $2.0 million that are rated 5 – 8\nare individually assessed for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Loans rated 5 – 8 that fall under the threshold amount are not individually tested for credit losses\nand therefore are not included in collateral dependent loans; (2) of the loans that are above the threshold amount and tested for credit losses after testing, some\nare considered to not be collateral dependent and are not included in collateral dependent loans.\n26\nTable of Contents\nBased on

Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses on loans is\nadjusted by the same amount. The defaults impact the loss rate by applicable loan pool for the quarterly CECL calculation. For individually analyzed loans\nwhich are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nThe following is a presentation of total foreclosed assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 29,824 $ 29,894\nConstruction/land development 12,919 47\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 297 545\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale $ 43,040 $ 30,486\n6.

Total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards, which are expected to be recognized over the vesting periods, was approximately\n$1.7 million as of September 30, 2024.\nThe table below summarizes the stock option transactions under the Plan at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and changes during the nine-\nmonth period and year then ended:\nFor the Nine Months Ended For the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted- Weighted-\nAverage Average\nExercisable Exercisable\nShares (000) Price Shares (000) Price\nOutstanding, beginning of year 2,776 $ 20.95 2,971 $ 20.45\nGranted — — 25 22.63\nForfeited/Expired (33) 21.87 (10) 23.38\nExercised (952) 18.13 (210) 14.01\nOutstanding, end of period 1,791 22.43 2,776 20.95\nExercisable, end of period 1,253 22.11 1,940 20.05\nStock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant-date fair value. For stock option awards, the fair\nvalue is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to\nwhich can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of\nemployee stock options granted but are not considered by the model. Accordingly, while management believes that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model\nprovides a reasonable estimate of fair value, the model does not necessarily provide the best single measure of fair value for the Company's employee stock\noptions. There were no options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of\ngrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the weighted-average assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility,\nrisk-free interest rate, and expected life of options granted.\nThe assumptions used in determining the fair value of the 2024 and 2023 stock option grants were as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended For the Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nExpected dividend yield Not Applicable 2.98 %\nExpected stock price volatility Not Applicable 27.97 %\nRisk-free interest rate Not Applicable 3.37 %\nExpected life of options Not Applicable 6.5 years\nThe following is a summary of currently outstanding and exercisable options at September 30, 2024:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nWeighted-\nOptions Average Weighted- Weighted-\nOutstanding Remaining Average Options Average\nShares Contractual Exercise Exercisable Exercise\nExercise Prices (000) Life (in years) Price Shares (000) Price\n$16.00 to $17.99 40 0.54 $ 17.12 40 $ 17.12\n$18.00 to $19.99 188 1.32 18.53 188 18.53\n$20.00 to $21.99 220 3.73 20.88 186 20.92\n$22.00 to $23.99 1,253 3.90 23.22 767 23.19\n$24.00 to $25.99 90 3.65 25.59 72 25.93\n1,791 1,253\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarized the activity for the Company’s restricted stock issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and\nchanges during the period and year then ended:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nBeginning of year 1,429 1,381\nIssued 516 261\nVested (461) (152)\nForfeited (59) (61)\nEnd of period 1,425 1,429\nAmount of expense for the nine months and twelve months ended, respectively $ 5,963 $ 8,016\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards, which are expected to be recognized over the vesting periods, was\napproximately $16.5 million as of September 30, 2024.\n14.

Leases\nThe Company leases land and office facilities under long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The leases expire at various dates through 2044\nand do not include renewal options based on economic factors that would have implied that continuation of the lease was reasonably certain. Certain leases\nprovide for increases in future minimum annual rental payments as defined in the lease agreements. The leases generally include real estate taxes and common\narea maintenance charges in the rental payments. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less. The Company does not separate nonlease\ncomponents from the associated lease component of our operating leases. As a result, the Company accounts for these components as a single component since\n(i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease components and the associated lease component are the same and (ii) the lease component, if accounted for\nseparately, would be classified as an operating lease. The Company recognizes short term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related right-of-\nuse (\"ROU\") asset and liability for such leases. In addition, equipment leases were determined to be immaterial and a related ROU asset and liability for such\nleases is not recorded.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the balances of the ROU asset and lease liability were $43.0 million and $45.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe balances of the ROU asset and lease liability were $42.2 million and $45.0 million, respectively. The ROU asset is included in bank premises and\nequipment, net, and the lease liability is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities.\nThe minimum rental commitments under these noncancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2024 $ 2,678 $ 9,373\n2025 10,201 8,549\n2026 9,468 8,111\n2027 8,144 7,223\n2028 6,368 5,496\nThereafter 22,053 19,827\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 58,912 $ 58,579\nDiscount effect of cash flows (13,064) (13,551)\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments $ 45,848 $ 45,028\nAdditional information (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nLease expense: September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 2,266 $ 2,059 $ 6,901 $ 5,937\nShort-term lease expense — — — —\nVariable lease expense 302 289 895 810\nTotal lease expense $ 2,568 $ 2,348 $ 7,796 $ 6,747\nOther information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities $ 1,972 $ 2,136 $ 6,802 $ 6,146\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 7.64 8.33 7.75 8.62\nWeighted-average discount rate 3.52 % 3.43 % 3.46 % 3.44 %\nThe Company currently leases two properties from two related parties. Total rent expense from the leases was $35,000, or 1.37% of total lease expense and\n$97,000, or 1.25% of total lease expense, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n43\nTable of Contents\n16. Significant Estimates and Concentrations of Credit Risks\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require disclosure of certain significant estimates and current vulnerabilities due\nto certain concentrations. Estimates related to the allowance for credit losses and certain concentrations of credit risk are reflected in Note 5, while deposit\nconcentrations are reflected in Note 8.\nThe Company’s primary market areas are in Arkansas, Florida, Texas, South Alabama and New York. The Company primarily grants loans to customers\nlocated within these markets unless the borrower has an established relationship with the Company.\nThe diversity of the Company’s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment. Although the Company has a loan portfolio that is\ndiversified in both industry and geographic area, a substantial portion of its debtors’ ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon real estate values,\ntourism demand and the economic conditions prevailing in its market areas.\nAlthough the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans represented 57.8%\nand 56.7% of total loans receivable, respectively, and 216.5% and 215.5% of total stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Residential real estate loans represented 16.3% and 15.8% of total loans receivable and 61.0% and 60.1% of total stockholders’ equity at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nApproximately 79.6% of the Company’s total loans and 83.5% of the Company’s real estate loans as of September 30, 2024, are to borrowers whose\ncollateral is located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Texas and New York, the states in which the Company has its branch locations.\nAny future volatility in the economy could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in\nmaterial future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for credit losses and capital that could negatively impact the Company’s ability to meet regulatory\ncapital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\n17. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company makes various commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities to fulfill the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These commitments and contingent liabilities include lines of credit and commitments to extend credit and issue standby letters of credit. The\nCompany applies the same credit policies and standards as they do in the lending process when making these commitments. The collateral obtained is based on\nthe assessed creditworthiness of the borrower.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commitments to extend credit of $4.53 billion and $4.59 billion, respectively, were outstanding. A\npercentage of these balances are participated out to other banks; therefore, the Company can call on the participating banks to fund future draws. Since some of\nthese commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOutstanding standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the Company, generally to guarantee the performance of a customer in third-\nparty borrowing arrangements. The term of the guarantee is dependent upon the creditworthiness of the borrower, some of which are long-term. The amount of\ncollateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts\nreceivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. Management uses the same credit policies in granting\nlines of credit as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these\nguarantees at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $154.4 million and $185.5 million, respectively.\nThe Company and/or its bank subsidiary have various unrelated legal proceedings, most of which involve loan foreclosure activity pending, which, in the\naggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations or cash flows of the Company and its subsidiary.\n18. Regulatory Matters\nThe Bank is subject to a legal limitation on dividends that can be paid to the parent company without prior approval of the applicable regulatory agencies.\nArkansas bank regulators have specified that the maximum dividend limit state banks may pay to the parent company without prior approval is 75% of the\ncurrent year earnings plus 75% of the retained net earnings of the preceding year. Since the Bank is also under supervision of the Federal Reserve, it is further\nlimited if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year by the Bank exceeds the Bank’s net profits to date for that year combined with its retained net\nprofits for the preceding two years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company requested approximately $232.4 million in regular\ndividends from its banking subsidiary.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s banking subsidiary is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the\nregulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, the Company’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not\nreflected in the consolidated financial statements.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, Tier 1\ncommon equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to\naverage assets (as defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nOn December 31, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and\nbanks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As\npart of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the\noption to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows\nbank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported\nallowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the Company's risk-based capital\nratios.\nBasel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to\nincorporate a CET1 requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the\nprompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a 4.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, a 6%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio and an 8% total risk-based capital ratio.\nThe Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital guidelines include the definitions for (1) a well-capitalized institution, (2) an adequately-capitalized\ninstitution, and (3) an undercapitalized institution. Under Basel III, the criteria for a well-capitalized institution are: a 6.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 5%\nTier 1 leverage capital ratio, an 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and a 10% total risk-based capital ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met the capital\nstandards for a well-capitalized institution. The Company’s CET1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total\nrisk-based capital ratio were 14.65%, 12.54%, 14.65%, and 18.28%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024.\n19.

Financial Instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of\nthree levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nTransfers of financial instruments between levels within the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the date management determines that the underlying\ncircumstances or assumptions have changed.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)the Company's available-for-sale securities are considered to be Level 2 securities. The Level 2 securities consist primarily\nof U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities plus state and political subdivisions. For these securities, the Company obtains fair\nvalue measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market\nspreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the\nbond’s terms and conditions, among other things.\nThe Company reviews the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to\nensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. In general, the Company does not purchase investment portfolio securities with complicated\nstructures. Pricing for the Company’s investment securities is fairly generic and is easily obtained. The Company uses a third-party comparison pricing vendor\nin order to reflect consistency in the fair values of the investment securities sampled by the Company each quarter.\n(cid:0)+ (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)the Company's held-to-maturity securities are considered to be Level 2 securities.

Impaired loans are carried at the net realizable value\nof the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for credit losses is allocated to impaired loans if the value of such loans is\ndeemed to be less than the unpaid balance. If these allocations cause the allowance for credit losses to require an increase, such increase is reported as a\ncomponent of the provision for credit losses. The fair value of loans with specific allocated losses was $74.3 million and $10.5 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This valuation is considered Level 3, consisting of appraisals of underlying collateral. The Company reversed\n$470,000 and $1.3 million of accrued interest receivable when impaired loans were put on non-accrual status during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company reversed $956,000 and $1.9 million of accrued interest receivable when impaired loans were put on non-accrual\nstatus during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(cid:0)) (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)Foreclosed assets held for sale are held by the Company at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At foreclosure, if the\nfair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company’s recorded investment in the related loan, a write-down is recognized\nthrough a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management and any subsequent reduction in value\nis recognized by a charge to income. The fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale is estimated using Level 3 inputs based on appraisals of underlying\ncollateral. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale, less estimated costs to sell, was $43.0 million and\n$30.5 million, respectively.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNo foreclosed assets held for sale were remeasured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Regulatory guidelines require the Company to\nreevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets held for sale on at least an annual basis. The Company’s policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines.\nThe significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent impaired loans and foreclosed\nassets primarily relate to customized discounting criteria applied to the customer’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends\nupon the condition and marketability of the underlying collateral. As the Company’s primary objective in the event of default would be to monetize the\ncollateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, less marketable collateral would receive a larger discount.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.

The amendments in the update clarify that\ncertain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the\ndiscounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in Topic 848, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for\nmargining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. Amendments in the update to the expedients and\nexceptions in Topic 848 capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by\nthe discounting transition. The amendments in this Update do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging relationships\nentered into after December 31, 2022, and existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging\nrelationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the\nhedging relationship.

To ensure the relief in Topic 848\ncovers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place, ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December\n31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, (cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)5 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:29)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)6 (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)’ (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)7 (cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:17) These amendments\nextend the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide\nrelief during the temporary transition period, so the FASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) would cease being published. In 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the intended cessation date of certain tenors\nof USD LIBOR to June 30, 2023. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take\nplace, the ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply\nthe relief in Topic 848.

The\namendments require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. Public entities are required to disclose, on an annual and\ninterim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition.

However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss\nmeasures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in\nmeasuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements. The Amendments require that a public entity disclose the title\nand position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources. Finally, the amendments require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required\nby the amendments in the ASU and all existing segment disclosures in ASC Topic 280.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to\nthe condensed financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the\nconsolidated balance sheet of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive\nincome (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 26, 2024, we expressed an\nunqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical\nprocedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in\naccordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.\nAccordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\n/s/ Forvis Mazars, LLP\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nNovember 1, 2024\n50\nTable of Contents\nItem 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024,\nwhich includes the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of\n$22.82 billion, loans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $14.51 billion, total deposits of $16.71 billion, and stockholders’ equity of $3.96 billion.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and Federal\nHome Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and other borrowed funds are our primary sources of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries\nand related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our return on average common equity, return on\naverage assets and net interest margin. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less\namortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is\na non-GAAP measure and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax\nequivalent basis and non-interest income excluding adjustments such as merger and acquisition expenses and/or certain gains, losses and other non-interest\nincome and expenses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\nAs of or for the Three Months Ended As of or for the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal assets $ 22,823,117 $ 21,950,638 $ 22,823,117 $ 21,950,638\nLoans receivable 14,823,979 14,271,833 14,823,979 14,271,833\nAllowance for credit losses (312,574) (285,562) (312,574) (285,562)\nTotal deposits 16,705,710 16,518,745 16,705,710 16,518,745\nTotal stockholders’ equity 3,959,789 3,654,874 3,959,789 3,654,874\nNet income 100,038 98,453 301,677 306,686\nBasic earnings per share 0.50 0.49 1.51 1.51\nDiluted earnings per share 0.50 0.49 1.51 1.51\nBook value per share 19.91 18.06 19.91 18.06\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP)(1) 12.67 10.90 12.67 10.90\nAnnualized net interest margin - FTE 4.28% 4.19% 4.23% 4.28%\nEfficiency ratio 41.42 45.53 42.91 44.76\nEfficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP)(2) 41.66 46.44 42.87 44.86\nReturn on average assets 1.74 1.78 1.77 1.84\nReturn on average common equity 10.23 10.65 10.53 11.32\n(1) See Table 21 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n(2) See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOverview\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)K (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)E (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:22)\nOur net income increased $1.6 million, or 1.6%, to $100.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from $98.5 million for the same\nperiod in 2023. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $0.50 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n$0.49 per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded $18.9 million in credit loss expense for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The $18.9 million of credit loss expense includes $18.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans. Of the $18.2 million provision for\ncredit losses on loans recorded, $16.7 million was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(\"FEMA\") disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the quarter. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted\nearnings per share for the quarter. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. The Company also recorded a $1.0 million provision for\ncredit losses on unfunded commitments, and we recorded a $330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the\nunrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $1.4 million\nincrease in the fair value of marketable securities.\nTotal interest income increased by $38.6 million, or 13.1%, and non-interest expense decreased $4.7 million, or 4.1%. This was partially offset by a $25.3\nmillion, or 27.4% increase in total interest expense and a $634,000, or 1.5%, decrease in non-interest income. These fluctuations are primarily due to the high\ninterest rate environment. The increase in interest income resulted from a $32.5 million, or 13.0%, increase in loan interest income and a $9.8 million, or\n419.6%, increase in interest income on deposits at other banks, which was partially offset by a $3.7 million, or 8.7%, decrease in investment interest income.\nThe decrease in non-interest expense was due to a decrease of $5.7 million, or 8.8%, in salaries and employee benefits and a decrease of $917,000, or 5.9%, in\noccupancy and equipment expense, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million, or 7.3%, in other operating expenses. The increase in interest\nexpense was primarily due to a $19.1 million, or 24.3%, increase in interest on deposits and a $6.2 million, or 76.2%, increase in interest on FHLB and other\nborrowed funds. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to a $3.1 million, or 69.1%, decrease in the fair value adjustment for marketable\nsecurities which was partially offset by a $1.3 million, or 41.7%, increase in mortgage lending income and a $1.3 million, or 21.6%, increase in other income.\nOur net interest margin increased from 4.19% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.28% for the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.60% and 6.09% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\naverage interest earning assets increased from $19.26 billion to $20.23 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a $706.1\nmillion increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $571.2 million increase in average loans receivable, partially offset by a $315.8\nmillion decrease in average investment securities. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately $500.0 million which\nwas dilutive to the net interest margin by approximately 10 basis points. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $1.9 million\nand $2.4 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by two\nbasis points. We recognized $573,000 in event income for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $521,000 for the three-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The remaining increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average interest-\nbearing assets at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the high interest rate environment.\nOur efficiency ratio was 41.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.53% for the same period in 2023. For the third quarter of\n2024, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 41.66%, compared to 46.44% reported for the third quarter of 2023. (See Table 25 for the non-GAAP\ntabular reconciliation).\nOur annualized return on average assets was 1.74% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.78% for the same period in 2023. (See\nTable 22 for the related non-GAAP financial measures and tabular reconciliation). Our annualized return on average common equity was 10.23% and 10.65%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.51 per share for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023. The Company recorded $31.4 million in credit loss expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, The $31.4 million of credit loss\nexpense includes $31.7 million in provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a a $330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale\ninvestments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $2.1 million gain on sale of building from\nour Texas region, a $2.1 million increase in the fair value of marketable securities and $162,000 in bank owned life insurance bank owned life insurance\n(\"BOLI\") death benefits, partially offset by $2.3 million of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") special assessment and a $2.0 million deferred tax\nasset write-down.\nTotal interest income increased by $108.2 million, or 12.5% and non-interest expense decreased by $11.0 million, or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a\n$100.8 million, or 41.2% increase in total interest expense. These fluctuations are primarily due to the high interest rate environment. The increase in interest\nincome resulted from a $92.0 million, or 12.6%, increase in loan interest income and a $24.4 million, or 227.6%, increase in interest income on deposits at\nother banks, partially offset by an $8.2 million, or 6.4%, decrease in investment income. The decrease in non-interest expense was due to a decrease of $13.3\nmillion, or 6.9%, in salaries and employee benefits and a decrease of $1.8 million, or 4.0%, in occupancy and equipment expense, which was partially offset by\nan increase of $4.3 million, or 5.4%, in other operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a $78.1 million, or 37.5%, increase in\ninterest on deposits, a $22.0 million, or 104.9%, increase in interest on FHLB and other borrowed funds and a $769,000, or 23.1%, increase in interest on\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.28% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.23% for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.

These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting\npolicies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting\nestimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely\nto occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most\ncritical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments,\nintangible assets, income taxes and stock options.\n54\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V .

Securities available-for-sale (\"AFS\") are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a\nseparate component of stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part\nof our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase\nregulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a\nloss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not\nthat the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell\nis met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates\nwhether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among\nother factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the\namortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an\nallowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has\nnot been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued\ninterest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the\nallowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\n(cid:0),(cid:0)Q (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)– (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)+ (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:17) Debt securities held-to-maturity (\"HTM\"), which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to\nhold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are\namortized/accreted to the call date to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. The Company evaluates\nall securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. The Company measures\nexpected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of\nexpected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company\nhas made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.

Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported\nat their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management’s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or\npayoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is\nconfirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.\nAdjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards,\nportfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross\ndomestic product, rental vacancy rate, housing price index and rental vacancy rate index.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan\nsegments are as follows:\n• 1-4 family construction\n• All other construction\n• 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) & junior liens\n• 1-4 family senior liens\n• Multifamily\n• Owner occupies commercial real estate\n• Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n• Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n• Consumer auto\n• Other consumer\n• Other consumer - Shore Premier Finance (\"SPF\")\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method (\"DCF\"). Loans evaluated individually\nthat are considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For these loans, where the Company has determined that foreclosure\nof the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided\nsubstantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the\ncollateral, net of estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the\noperation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of\nexpected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date\nexceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan, net of estimated costs to sell. For individually analyzed loans which are not considered to be collateral dependent,\nan allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term\nexcludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n• Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nwill be executed with an individual borrower.\n• The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally\ncancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in\nassessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors (\"Q-Factors\") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be\nconsidered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and\nstrategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and\nnonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment;\n(viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system; and (ix) economic conditions.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower’s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and\nbusiness conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are\ncharged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-\naccrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the\ncurrent year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are\nusually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the\ncustomer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit\ndeteriorated (“PCD”) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The\ninitial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit\nlosses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or\npremium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the\nprovision for credit loss.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)% (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which\nthe Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 months to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not\namortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis.

The income tax accounting\nguidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income\ntaxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences\nbetween the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more\nlikely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term “more likely than not” means a\nlikelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms “examined” and “upon examination” also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any.\nA tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a\ngreater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The\ndetermination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information\navailable at the reporting date and is subject to the management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of\nevidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns.

Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis.\nThe adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and\nstate income tax rate (24.989% for 2024 and 24.6735% for 2023).\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest,\nincluding the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate four times during 2023. First, on February 1,\n2023, the target rate was increased to 4.50% to 4.75%, second, on March 22, 2023, the target rate was increased to 4.75% to 5.00%, third, on May 3, 2023, the\ntarget rate was increased to 5.00% to 5.25% and fourth, on July 26, 2023, the target rate was increased to 5.25% to 5.50%. On September 18, 2024, the Federal\nReserve reduced the target rate to 4.75% to 5.00%.\nOur net interest margin increased from 4.19% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.28% for the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.60% and 6.09% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\naverage interest earning assets increased from $19.26 billion to $20.23 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a $706.1\nmillion increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $571.2 million increase in average loans receivable, partially offset by a $315.8\nmillion decrease in average investment securities. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately $500.0 million which\nwas dilutive to the net interest margin by 10 basis points. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $1.9 million and $2.4\nmillion, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by two basis\npoints. We recognized $573,000 in event income for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $521,000 for the three-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The remaining increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in average interest-\nbearing assets at higher interest rates primarily as a result of the high interest rate environment.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.28% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 4.23% for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The yield on interest earning assets was 6.52% and 5.95% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as\naverage interest earning assets increased from $19.63 billion to $20.16 billion. The increase in average interest earning assets is primarily due to a $564.7\nmillion increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks, a $326.0 million increase in average loans receivable and a $1.1 million increase in\naverage federal funds sold, partially offset by a $368.8 million decrease in average investment securities. During the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024, the Company held excess liquidity of approximately $500.0 million which was dilutive to the net interest margin by 10 basis points. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $6.5 million and $8.3 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The\nreduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by one basis point. We recognized $3.4 million in event income for the nine-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $2.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $14.6 million, or 7.2%, to $217.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30,\n2024, from $203.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase in net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was the\nresult of a $39.9 million increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a $25.3 million increase in interest expense, on a fully taxable equivalent\nbasis. The $39.9 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher yield on earning assets resulted in\nan increase in interest income of approximately $22.9 million, in addition to an increase of $17.0 million in interest income due to the change in average\ninterest earning asset balances. The $25.3 million increase in interest expense is also primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher rates\non interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $14.2 million, in addition to an increase in average interest bearing\nliabilities which increased interest expense by approximately $11.1 million.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $9.2 million, or 1.5%, to $637.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024, from $628.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase in net interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was the result\nof a $110.0 million increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a $100.8 million increase in interest expense, on a fully taxable equivalent basis.\nThe $110.0 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher yield on earning assets resulted in an\nincrease in interest income of approximately $80.6 million, in addition to an increase of $29.4 million in interest income due to the change in average interest\nearning asset balances. The $100.8 million increase in interest expense is also primarily the result of the high interest rate environment. The higher rates on\ninterest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $70.6 million, in addition to an increase in average interest bearing\nliabilities which increased interest expense by approximately $30.2 million.\n59\nTable of Contents\nTables 2 and 3 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, as well as changes in the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\nTable 2: Analysis of Net Interest Income\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income $ 332,845 $ 294,262 $ 977,063 $ 868,833\nFully taxable equivalent adjustment 2,616 1,293 6,136 4,415\nInterest income – fully taxable equivalent 335,461 295,555 983,199 873,248\nInterest expense 117,625 92,325 345,431 244,658\nNet interest income – fully taxable equivalent $ 217,836 $ 203,230 $ 637,768 $ 628,590\nYield on earning assets – fully taxable equivalent 6.60 % 6.09 % 6.52 % 5.95 %\nCost of interest-bearing liabilities 3.17 2.69 3.14 2.38\nNet interest spread – fully taxable equivalent 3.43 3.40 3.38 3.57\nNet interest margin – fully taxable equivalent 4.28 4.19 4.23 4.28\nTable 3: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023\n(In thousands)\nIncrease in interest income due to change in earning assets $ 16,977 $ 29,381\nIncrease in interest income due to change in earning asset yields 22,929 80,570\nIncrease in interest expense due to change in interest-bearing liabilities (11,129) (30,161)\nIncrease in interest expense due to change in interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities (14,171) (70,612)\nIncrease in net interest income $ 14,606 $ 9,178\n60\nTable of Contents\nTable 4 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amount outstanding, the interest income or expense on\nthat amount and the average rate earned or expensed for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Of the $18.2 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, $16.7\nmillion was used to establish a hurricane reserve for loans located in the FEMA disaster areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall during the\nquarter. The hurricane related reserve had a six-cent impact to diluted earnings per share for the quarter. The remaining portion of the provision was related to\nloan growth. The Company also recorded a $1.0 million provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and recorded a $330,000 recovery of credit\nlosses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement in the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $31.4 million in credit loss expense. The $31.4 million of credit loss expense includes $31.7 million in\nprovision for credit losses on loans, which as partially offset by the $330,000 recovery of credit losses on available-for-sale investments due to an improvement\nin the unrealized losses for one of our subordinated debt investments. Of the $31.7 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded, $16.7 million was used\nto establish a hurricane reserve for loans. The remaining portion of the provision was related to loan growth. For both the three and nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company determined the $2.0 million allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio was adequate. Therefore, no\nadditional provision was considered necessary for the HTM portfolio.\nNet charge-offs to average total loans was 0.04% and 0.08% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net charge-offs to\naverage total loans was 0.07% and 0.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n63\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H\nTotal non-interest income was $42.8 million and $127.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $43.4 million and\n$127.1 million for the same period in 2023.

Multi-family residential loans are included in CRE for regulatory purposes.\nOur loan policy states that in order to achieve a well-balanced, diversified credit portfolio, concentrations containing inappropriate or excessive risk are to\nbe avoided. It is the goal of the Company to maintain a prudent diversification of loans. We define a concentration of credit as direct or indirect obligations\naccording to the following guidelines: (i) concentrations of 25% or more of total risk-based capital by individual borrower, small, interrelated group of\nindividuals, single repayment source or individual project; (ii) concentrations of 100% or more of total risk-based capital by industry or product line. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have not met the threshold for the concentration limits. In addition, the Bank's Board of Directors monitors the CRE loan portfolio for\nconcentrations related to geography, industry, and collateral type and determines applicable guidelines. The Chief Lending Officer also reviews the portfolio\nperiodically to determine if any concentrations exist and makes recommendations with respect to setting internal guidelines.\nThe Company also monitors key risk indicators (\"KRIs\") on a quarterly basis for the overall loan portfolio as well as specific KRIs for the CRE portfolio.\nThe KRIs are tied to the Bank's appetite for credit risk which is reflected in the Bank's credit policy and underwriting criteria. The KRIs related to underwriting\ninclude loan downgrades by loan review, loan downgrades to classified levels and loan policy exceptions (loan to value, debt coverage ratio and credit score).\nThe KRIs related to CRE loans include concentrations of construction and land loans, concentrations of total CRE loans, CRE loans in excess of loan to value\nguidelines and total real estate loans in excess of loan to value guidelines. The results of the KRI analysis are presented to the Bank's Asset Quality Committee\non a quarterly basis. Any exceptions to established limits and thresholds are monitored and addressed in a timely manner as required by the Asset Quality\nCommittee.\nThe Company has a CRE strategy and contingency plan which outlines the principles required to adequately manage our CRE exposures. It discusses the\ninherent risks within CRE lending, as well as the risks unique to specific lending activities and property taxes. In addition, the plan outlines internal limits\nrelated to CRE lending, reasoning for operating outside those limits, and provides for a contingency plan to reduce the CRE exposures under adverse economic\nconditions or other situations where it is deemed necessary to do so. The responsibility for monitoring the CRE Strategy and Contingency Plan, and subsequent\nreporting to Management and the Board of Directors lies with the Chief Lending Officer and the Asset Quality Committee of the Board of Directors. Within the\nCRE Strategy and Contingency Plan, we established four adverse economic triggers to measure on an ongoing basis to attempt to determine when a change in\nCRE strategy might be warranted, at least from an external economic perspective. If one or a combination of these triggers have exceeded Board approved\nthresholds, the Executive Risk Committee will determine which action or combination of actions to take based on the specific situation. The required actions\nare likely to focus on tightening/loosening of underwriting criteria, potential capital raises or loan distribution actions such as selling or participating loans.\nHowever, other action steps may be considered necessary depending upon the specific situation. As of September 30, 2024, the leading economic indicator\ntrigger exceeded our internal guidelines, but we have not recommended any additional changes to our underwriting standards because the Company considers\nthe current standards to be adequate in addressing the risks to our CRE portfolio.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17) We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market\nareas.

Residential real estate loans\ngenerally have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90%.

The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current\nfinancial information of the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow\n(debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage,\nmanagement experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of\ncollateral. Generally, accounts receivable are financed at between 50% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will\nrange between 50% and 80% (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans.\nAs of September 30, 2024, commercial and industrial loans totaled $2.08 billion, or 14.1%, of loans receivable, compared to $2.32 billion, or 16.1%, of\nloans receivable, as of December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG\nmarkets were $416.1 million, $448.5 million, $821.4 million, $25.2 million, $143.2 million and $230.2 million at September 30, 2024, respectively.\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nWe classify our problem loans into three categories: past due loans, special mention loans and classified loans (accruing and non-accruing).\nWhen management determines that a loan is no longer performing, and that collection of interest appears doubtful, the loan is placed on non-accrual status.\nLoans that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both\nprincipal and interest. Our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as “special mention” or otherwise classified\nor on non-accrual status.\nPurchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An allowance for credit losses is\ndetermined using the same methodology as other loans. The Company develops separate PCD models for each loan segment with PCD loans not individually\nanalyzed for credit losses. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between\nthe initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the\nloan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses. The Company held approximately $79.6\nmillion and $130.7 million in PCD loans, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nTable 11 sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of these dates, all non-\nperforming restructured loans are included in non-accrual loans.\nTable 11: Non-performing Assets\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans $ 95,747 $ 59,971\nLoans past due 90 days or more (principal or interest payments) 5,356 4,130\nTotal non-performing loans 101,103 64,101\nOther non-performing assets\nForeclosed assets held for sale, net 43,040 30,486\nOther non-performing assets 63 785\nTotal other non-performing assets 43,103 31,271\nTotal non-performing assets $ 144,206 $ 95,372\nAllowance for credit losses to non-accrual loans 326.46 % 480.62 %\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 309.16 449.66\nNon-accrual loans to total loans 0.65 0.42\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.68 0.44\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.63 0.42\n72\nTable of Contents\nOur non-performing loans are comprised of non-accrual loans and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days. Our bank subsidiary recognizes\nincome principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as non-accrual, the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is\naccrued, unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to\nbe uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for credit losses.\nTotal non-performing loans were $101.1 million and $64.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Non-performing loans\nat September 30, 2024 were $30.4 million, $40.8 million, $20.0 million, $391,000, $6.8 million and $2.8 million in the Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Alabama, SPF\nand Centennial CFG markets, respectively.\nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG Capital Markets Group consists of two loans that are assessed for credit risk by the\nFederal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The loans are not current on either principal or interest, and we have reversed any interest that had\naccrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve. Any interest payments that are received will be applied to the principal balance.\nIn addition, the $22.8 million balance of foreclosed assets held for sale for our Centennial CFG Property Finance Group consists of an office building located\nin California. This represents the largest component of the Company's $43.0 million in foreclosed assets held for sale.\nDebt restructuring generally occurs when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term. As a result, we\nwill work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. In those circumstances it may be\nbeneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having\nto dispose of it in potentially an unfavorable and depressed real estate market. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually either reduce the\nmonthly payment and/or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months. For our restructured loans that accrue interest at the time the loan is\nrestructured, it would be a rare exception to have charged-off any portion of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had $6.5 million of restructured loans that\nare in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non-accrual, and we had $17.7 million of restructured loans that are not in\ncompliance with the modified terms and are reported as non-accrual. Of the $6.5 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms,\nour Arkansas market contained $1.5 million, our Florida market contained $1.2 million, our Texas market contained $1.5 million and our New York region\ncontained $2.2 million of these restructured loans. Of the $17.7 million of restructured loans not in compliance with the modified terms, our Arkansas market\ncontained $1.3 million, our Florida market contained $16.0 million and our Texas market contained $425,000.\nA loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted. These loans can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-\naccrual, or continuing on an accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a non-accrual loan that is\nrestructured remains on non-accrual for a period of nine months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior\nto the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay under the new terms\nand may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule\nis not reasonably assured, the loan will remain in a non-accrual status.\nThe majority of the Bank’s restructured loans relate to real estate lending and generally involve reducing the interest rate, changing from a principal and\ninterest payment to interest-only, lengthening the amortization period, or a combination of some or all of the three. In addition, it is common for the Bank to\nseek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan. At September 30, 2024, the amount of restructured loans was $24.2 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, 26.8% of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure.\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale were $43.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $30.5 million as of December 31, 2023, for an increase of\n$12.6 million. The foreclosed assets held for sale as of September 30, 2024 are comprised of $21,000 located in Arkansas, $7.3 million located in Florida,\n$13.0 million located in Texas, zero in Alabama, zero in SPF and $22.8 million in Centennial CFG. The majority of the foreclosed assets held for sale is\ncomprised of three properties. The first is an office building located in Santa Monica, California with a carrying value of $22.8 million. The second is an\napartment complex which is under construction in Gunter, Texas with a carrying value of $12.8 million, and the third is an office building located in Miami,\nFlorida with a carrying value of $7.0 million. These three properties account for $42.6 million of the balance of foreclosed assets held for sale at September 30,\n2024.\n73\nTable of Contents\nTable 12 shows the summary of foreclosed assets held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 12: Foreclosed Assets Held For Sale\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential $ 29,824 $ 29,894\nConstruction/land development 12,919 47\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family 297 545\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale $ 43,040 $ 30,486\nThe Company had $134.1 million and $94.9 million in impaired loans (which includes loans individually analyzed for credit losses for which a specific\nreserve has been recorded, non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and restructured loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty) for the\nperiods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory\ncapital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale.

Total deposits were $16.71 billion as of September 30,\n2024, and $16.79 billion as of December 31, 2023. Deposits are our primary source of funds. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain\ndeposit customers. Those products consist of checking accounts, regular savings deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit.\nDeposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. In addition, we obtain deposits from state and local entities and, to a\nlesser extent, U.S. Government and other depository institutions.\nOur policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. From time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, we accept brokered\ntime deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250,000, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks. We also participate in\nthe One-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) service and similar services, which provide for one-way buy transactions among banks for the purpose of\npurchasing cost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these sources represent a reliable\nand cost-efficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation deteriorates, or to the extent that there are\nsignificant changes in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be\nrequired to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nTable 17 reflects the classification of the brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 17: Brokered Deposits\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nInsured Cash Sweep and Other Transaction Accounts $ 421,274 $ 401,004\nTotal Brokered Deposits $ 421,274 $ 401,004\nThe interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. We will continue to\nmanage interest expense through deposit pricing. We may allow higher rate deposits to run off during periods of limited loan demand. We believe that\nadditional funds can be attracted, and deposit growth can be realized through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest,\nincluding the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that, if enforced, could\nhave a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we\nmust meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under\nregulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components, risk\nweightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems” and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nAct (“Basel III”). Basel III applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and savings\nand loan holding companies. Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. Basel III limits a banking organization’s\ncapital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of common\nequity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nBasel III amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital requirement and to raise the capital\nrequirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is\nrequired to have at least a 4.5% CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and an 8% total risk-based capital\nratio.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table\nbelow) of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject.\nOn December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and\nbanks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As\npart of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the\noption to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows\nbank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported\nallowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the risk-based capital ratios\npresented below.\n81\nTable of Contents\nTable 19 presents our risk-based capital ratios on a consolidated basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 19: Risk-Based Capital\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTier 1 capital\nStockholders’ equity $ 3,959,789 $ 3,791,075\nASC 326 transitional period adjustment 8,123 16,246\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles, net (1,440,198) (1,446,573)\nUnrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 194,862 249,075\nTotal common equity Tier 1 capital 2,722,576 2,609,823\nTotal Tier 1 capital 2,722,576 2,609,823\nTier 2 capital\nAllowance for credit losses 312,574 288,234\nASC 326 transitional period adjustment (8,123) (16,246)\nDisallowed allowance for credit losses (limited to 1.25% of risk weighted assets) (70,729) (40,509)\nQualifying allowance for credit losses 233,722 231,479\nQualifying subordinated notes 439,394 439,834\nTotal Tier 2 capital 673,116 671,313\nTotal risk-based capital $ 3,395,692 $ 3,281,136\nAverage total assets for leverage ratio $ 21,704,064 $ 20,981,774\nRisk weighted assets $ 18,578,700 $ 18,440,964\nRatios at end of period\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital 14.65 % 14.15 %\nLeverage ratio 12.54 12.44\nTier 1 risk-based capital 14.65 14.15\nTotal risk-based capital 18.28 17.79\nMinimum guidelines – Basel III\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital 7.00 % 7.00 %\nLeverage ratio 4.00 4.00\nTier 1 risk-based capital 8.50 8.50\nTotal risk-based capital 10.50 10.50\nWell-capitalized guidelines\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital 6.50 % 6.50 %\nLeverage ratio 5.00 5.00\nTier 1 risk-based capital 8.00 8.00\nTotal risk-based capital 10.00 10.00\nAs of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, our bank subsidiary was “well-capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt\ncorrective action.

The items used in these calculations are included in financial results presented in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nEarnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they exclude\ncertain items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains and losses.

Our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk. The asset/liability committees of the boards of directors of\nour holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset/liability management policies, overseeing the formulation and\nimplementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position.\nOur objective is to manage liquidity in a way that ensures cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in a timely and orderly fashion\nwhile ensuring the reliance on various funding sources does not become so heavily weighted to any one source that it causes undue risk to the bank. Our\nliquidity sources are prioritized based on availability and ease of activation. Our current liquidity condition is a primary driver in determining our funding\nneeds and is a key component of our asset and liability management.\nVarious sources of liquidity are available to meet the cash flow needs of depositors and borrowers. Our principal source of funds is core deposits, including\nchecking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We may also from time to time obtain wholesale funding through brokered deposits.\nSecondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other\nborrowings, such as through correspondent banking relationships. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are\nmore beneficial to us. Additionally, as needed, we can liquidate or utilize our available-for-sale investment portfolio as collateral to provide funds for an\nintermediate source of liquidity.\n87\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0),(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ . Our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings, primarily net interest income, are susceptible to changes in market\ninterest rates. It is management’s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks.\nA key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed. The single most significant measure\nof interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The more closely the repricing periods are\ncorrelated, the less interest rate risk we assume. We use net interest income simulation modeling and economic value of equity as the primary methods in\nanalyzing and managing interest rate risk.\nOne of the tools that our management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model. This analysis calculates the\ndifference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario. The income simulation model\nincludes various assumptions regarding the re-pricing relationships for each of our products. Many of our assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to\nre-price immediately, and proportional to the change in market rates, depending on their contracted index. Some loans and investments include the opportunity\nof prepayment (embedded options), and accordingly, the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current\nyields. Our non-term deposit products re-price overnight in the model while we project certain other deposits by product type to have stable balances based on\nour deposit history. This accounts for the portion of our portfolio that moves more slowly than market rates and changes at our discretion.\nThis analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet remains\nstatic and that its structure does not change over the course of the year. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by\nmanagement to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change.\nFurthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment\nrates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects\non our net interest income.\nFor the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by 200 and 100\nbasis points, respectively. At September 30, 2024, our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the\ncurrent guidelines established by us.\nTable 26 presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nTable 26: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income\nPercentage Change from Base Percentage Change from Base September 30,\nInterest Rate Scenario September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 2024 vs. 2023\nUp 200 basis points 9.92 % 7.50 % 2.42 %\nUp 100 basis points 5.17 3.80 1.37\nDown 100 basis points (5.78) (4.70) (1.08)\nDown 200 basis points (11.74) (9.60) (2.14)\nThere have been no material changes in our market risk exposure from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Our balance sheet mix has remained\nconsistent, and there has been only one target rate change by the Federal Reserve reducing the target rate from 5.25% to 5.50% as of July 26, 2023, to 4.75% to\n5.00% on September 18, 2024.\nItem 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls\nBased on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are\neffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
