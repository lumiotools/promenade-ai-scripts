On Track to Sign 20 Transplant Centers by End of 2025\n\nNov 12, 2024\n\nOncocyte Reports Commercial Launch Progress; On Track to Sign 20 Transplant Centers by End of 2025\n\n  * Transplant centers representing about 9% of German transplant volumes and about 2% of U.S. transplant volumes have signed on to use GraftAssure kitted research test in early launch phase\n  * FDA pre-submission process for approval of kitted clinical test is underway\n\n\n\nIRVINE, Calif., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncocyte Corporation (Nasdaq: OCX) (“Oncocyte” or the “Company”), a diagnostics technology company, today published the following letter to shareholders in conjunction with its third quarter results:\n\nFellow Shareholders,\n\nWe are pleased to report that we are making considerable progress on two fronts that help de-risk our path to meaningful revenue. First, we are continuing to sign new research customers at well-respected hospitals and universities. In addition to the two customers mentioned in our [August update](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l8oKrFvitP3_K1_a_FZJuRMsNgfMQOXke3u9nVa7eE8Doez5i89Z3-jFJv78RWdDoqVrwKkn0Hax5FE5hptYw2jUaEa6muSKZfC0g82IqyFYk4sQEFXNxPI1GPUapbL37NtdaehSib_KFPmF8AtouaQiD-36abN3qkcrWbAEdk1UX_6FzxXnZBziFV38o419dXQhKPREnZqVXQoUIye7Rw==), we have now signed agreements with two leading transplant university hospitals in the U.S. and Germany, as well as major research hospitals in Switzerland, Austria, and the U.K. Given the concentrated nature of the transplant market, we believe each new customer represents a key step toward capturing an estimated $1 billion global total addressable market for our transplant rejection testing technology.\n\nSecond, our clinical kitted test product development remains on track, and we have already had productive dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which we describe below.\n\nThe international response to GraftAssure™, which is our research-use-only assay that can detect early evidence of graft organ damage, is exceeding our expectations. We attribute this success to our robust research partnerships in Europe, and to our team’s scientific leadership in researching the dd-cfDNA biomarker1 for over a decade. Our customers in Germany now represent about 9% of the country’s annual organ transplant volumes.2\n\nAdditionally, we are making inroads toward capturing share in the much larger U.S. market. In August, we reported that our U.S. sales funnel represents 25% of transplant volumes. Three months later, we are pleased to report that hospitals representing about 2% of overall organ transplant volumes3 have now signed up to use GraftAssure.\n\nWe also received significant interest and engagement from the transplant lab community at the American Society for Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics (ASHI) conference in Anaheim in October. This continuous positive reinforcement from the customer base gives us confidence that we are on the right track.\n\n**Executive summary**\n\nOncocyte is at a pivotal stage in commercializing our IP in organ transplant, primarily by making a kitted test that quantifies an established biomarker, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), and uses a digital-PCR workflow that we believe offers distinct advantages over assays run on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Our scientists have played a pivotal role over the past decade in developing the science that established dd-cfDNA as a trusted biomarker4, and we are now commercializing a product by pursuing a market disruptive approach. We aim to deliver proven, more affordable, faster tests that can be run at local labs.\n\nWhile we don’t expect meaningful revenue in transplant rejection testing until we have reached the clinical in-vitro diagnostic (IVD5) stage of our kitted product development, we believe that customers who are signing up for GraftAssure RUO are motivated by the eventual opportunity to use our IVD kits to measure this biomarker in their own labs, capturing the benefit of a rapid response time and the ability to generate revenue by running the test.\n\nWe also can run our clinical-use assay, VitaGraft, at our clinical lab in Nashville. We received Medicare reimbursement on that test in August 2023.\n\n**Strategic progress**\n\nWe are on track to meet the commitment that we made to investors in August to have more than 20 transplant centers running GraftAssure tests through the end of 2025. We estimate that each center represents a potential annual high-margin revenue stream of several hundred thousand dollars to $2 million of clinical-use tests, depending on the size of the center.\n\nBy staying science-driven and putting customers first, we are building solid relationships. Deploying our GraftAssure assay is a key part of our land-and-expand strategy to drive commercial adoption of our tests.\n\nWe are especially pleased to report on how quickly we are moving to capture market share. GraftAssure began shipping in June and in less than five months, we are well into step two of our land-and-expand strategy. In fact, we have one customer in the U.S. and one prominent university hospital in Europe that are progressing to stage three. A simple breakdown:\n\n**Land: Drive market penetration with GraftAssure to build customer install base**\n\n1. **Convert sales funnel into signed customers:** Either our sales team or Bio-Rad’s, or a combination of both, helps introduce our assay to potential academic research customers. Then, we work with institutions to sign agreements to run GraftAssure.\n\n2. **Empower labs to run our assay in-house:** Our team provides comprehensive training on the digital-PCR workflow used for GraftAssure, which we believe offers distinct advantages over assays run on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology.6\n\n3. **Drive routine use of GraftAssure & reorders: **Customer labs begin to run GraftAssure to perform research. Once the lab uses up the initial GraftAssure marketing samples, they place orders for additional kits. Initially, we expect kit orders will reflect nominal (low revenue) amounts and will increase significantly in the next phase of our strategy.\n\n**Expand: Democratize testing through FDA-cleared VitaGraft+ kit**\n\n4. **Obtain regulatory clearance for clinical use:** Oncocyte is pursuing IVD clearance from the FDA for VitaGraft+, which is based on the same underlying IP and is similar to GraftAssure. In Europe, we will be pursuing CE Marketing under In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVD-R).7\n\n5. **Obtain reimbursement from Medicare and other payors:** Shortly after FDA clearance, we expect MolDx to attach a coverage decision to VitaGraft+, making it a reimbursed test. (Note that the version of the test that we run at our Nashville lab received [reimbursement in August 2023](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rQKPE_rhPWLr2zUGSCyC7-VEW3b476Kqj0igPEAKihKgg-mjbx5ojgPy1t2LFOe0M59EWCBszy9sC_IQKLr6SxtBPf3w7m4cmP1iuMpxhV6eO5WjX_0YgCOTk737jF0Vz0TRm2tYq2g0drDzYXZuLSY61_MDyCtrNl6lhJgggF4=)).\n\n6. **Begin to generate meaningful revenue:** Oncocyte expects to sell about $1 million per year in VitaGraft+ kits to an average hospital lab customer, which would order the test to manage its patients in house. Our goal is to enable labs to serve patients more quickly, and to bill payors, thus generating revenue for the hospital and increasing the sustainability of local care for the community. To put it simply, we expect our kits would enable the lab to perform the test to generate revenue for the lab.\n\nTo recap, our strategy is to _land_ major transplant centers and research universities with our research-use-only (RUO) product. Doing so establishes our technology and increases its potential utility by enabling researchers to explore and expand potential applications of dd-cfDNA.\n\nOnce we have achieved FDA clearance for our test kits to be used to make clinical decisions – that is, approved as an IVD – we believe that these institutions will begin using our VitaGraft+ tests to manage their patients, while continuing to use our GraftAssure test kit to perform research. Of note, our GraftAssure research product _may not be used_ to support clinical treatment decisions.\n\nWe are pleased with our strategic progress and our ability to move quickly to establish a customer base to support future revenue growth. As a reminder of our journey to date: The first prototypes of GraftAssure were completed in December 2023, and by April 2024, we welcomed Bio-Rad Laboratories as an investor and strategic partner, supporting GraftAssure’s global launch. Under this partnership, Bio-Rad and Oncocyte are co-marketing GraftAssure in the U.S. and Germany. Bio-Rad has exclusive distribution and commercial rights of the RUO product outside the U.S. and Germany, with the exception of several major potential international customers where both companies have mutually agreed to allow Oncocyte to take commercial lead.\n\nThe transplant market is highly concentrated with fewer than 100 academic and research centers in the U.S. that account for approximately 80% of transplant volumes8. Markets outside the U.S. are similarly concentrated within high-end academic institutions. Bio-Rad’s global infrastructure puts those centers well within reach, allowing for high-touch sales and service in those regions.\n\n**Regulatory update**\n\nWe are pleased to report that our FDA pre-submission remains on track. Since our last quarterly update, we have cleared the first stage gate in our clinical product development process and submitted a Q-Sub to the FDA.\n\nSpecifically, Oncocyte has submitted its plan for an IVD version of the dd-cfDNA kitted test to the FDA, beginning the Q-submission process. We already have begun to engage in productive dialogue with the FDA, and a meeting is scheduled for early December in connection with the submission. The Q-sub is a formal pathway for companies to get written feedback on their development plan and is a critical step in gaining confidence in the validation process that we expect to begin in early 2025.\n\nAs a reminder, the IVD development process occurs in three phases, culminating in FDA submission. Since our August update, we have completed Phase 1: Planning and Inputs. We are currently in Phase 2: Design and Outputs and will proceed with Phase 3: Verification and Validation thereafter.\n\nMeanwhile, we also are thrilled to report that several hospitals have expressed interest in supporting the FDA submission process. Six hospitals or clinics, all of which are in major cities (given the highly concentrated nature of the transplant market) have expressed interest in participating in our clinical observational study. In addition, four institutions have expressed interest in participating in the reproducibility study. We believe these sites represent potential future VitaGraft+ customers.\n\nThe clinical director of one transplant center, who expressed interest in supporting our FDA submission, told us that his transplant center would benefit from having access to a kitted product. Because Oncocyte’s kitted test is run on a digital PCR instrument9, our FDA-cleared tests will be designed to provide actionable information when the time to treat is critical. “In a for-cause setting, send out testing doesn’t do me any good,” the clinical director said. “I cannot wait for two days.”\n\n**Scientific update**\n\nWe continue to advance the science of dd-cfDNA and demonstrate its clinical value.\n\nOn August 11, Transplant International[published a review](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EzO5--AY5U6keVxEzMbILEJSXEI2ZqIq854N2QzJnZB15UHV7wXvoHmARoltxZY_4WNjb7u5JlUeN0Zr63B3chj1ouH3aN5K-mjZYp0cU1GNl_MLfdchHkszkNijbDaOesw_SbzI4pI6OS6llivduvpHr4Jq5zKLKfIc4IG6nOOG6y1v4xLzeflkk6nks4cwKRmtK-updIA0dAC9nlIUxk5VPlcpZ48AR_DTKKG_invF2lfmKEIRATsAJV0EMJONxIdVELWIVRwFkF8M16mAjSLK-Suk0mzEfLzWmdsBlUeCLzIJeNQM2pRn-W8ojK0kq3MiPxav_SIC_mDOm1VJh5S6YowVhOF7HoJY3pLpQaRKUWzBT7VGGhM-TD27Kmcb) that concluded that dd-cfDNA is a valuable, non-invasive biomarker that enhances graft surveillance and personalized therapy for patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), potentially improving outcomes and reducing premature graft loss.\n\nAlso in August, we announced a [case series](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=c7n7nmK4Sf5oCnEsl4F1ubcyiOTK4FgxEb89zPooKrdxapzCjZ67gd3ptUuKmpf5LX-k0lww--426iI1y7DHfx5VaGR_1qqppkycSEBo1CPYzGBLUE8Q4qqU0CWdjbfAzU6nrNEtkJrTEGf2Q9ccrA==) that represented the second study showing VitaGraft Kidney as a measure of response to the benefit of therapy on AMR, which is a leading cause of allograft failure. The case series study, involving two patients, underscored the significant potential of using repeated VitaGraft Kidney measurements to monitor the efficacy of a targeted therapy drug, in this case, daratumumab.\n\nThe daratumumab study represented the second publication this year that showed Oncocyte’s ability to monitor therapeutic efficacy. In the [phase 2 randomized controlled trial](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W0S4vdIqmU712SN6TIXT-q3QG81Lg5_M8ntOzG1rPX4Xpx1T7AKS8ZpZbHKKYKS0sqggqTJYLO_K4AKVX-ODkW3w0FMuctY7HOGYO6OGQJd0skr7NEtFsmBSgp5zxHBnMEmM_JVZjidJeyXwVpbhJlLoDllzLr0LCvD5UzuQCkw0beHjf3Xs2un-NVWw85H9) published in [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4EK0b_mELtGcNBC3URFCm9DLEE4OzXawytoD4ysCpIA2YMJrLOTGxYWNoMwFjZPxR_xZABG4NsmQ5B4JtCZejR9CVsLQm5Wc5dqX7SPD2z4e3mkba4SvMAIn9YaPqCJBvExxtXCqA1ibxtK0gAn8dA==) in May 2024, VitaGraft Kidney was also used to measure the response to the drug felzartamab for patients with AMR after kidney transplantation.\n\nThese papers’ authors included Oncocyte’s Chief Science Officer, Ekke Schuetz, and Senior R&D Director, Julia Beck.\n\nWe believe that the growing body of literature around the dd-cfDNA biomarker should support claims expansion, which we expect to translate to an increase in our total addressable market. Within the coming years, we expect to see claims expansion regarding using dd-cfDNA to monitor DSA+ patients, in the application of anti-CD38 drugs, as described above with daratumumab and felzartamab, and claims expansion to monitoring for minimal residual disease (MRD) in transplant rejection. Notably, in October, felzartamab received [Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from FDA](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q3NB6O26C7PPPp3WuuzMxRr_thwJme5E0M5OZH7gdnTaK47aK8N7HoDF7pEjsd9f61LD6ZIOK8UK3Myno1qsOn3Zf-A6bKb4YCsulvYjnrlbsOgiRAbqj35x-hEiWHAdFlz_Wddp2rN77y5qly_EYDd6Kzq9vzHZxJqEg3s5L_ziDU9LHoBzjIHQm_6UloPfY_3CU7ifjAXwLwZqXSR-A6LkNC8XrwvhvxvEwEt0aFb2EmiiNeg74ey474czl9hX) for the treatment of late AMR in kidney transplant patients.\n\nFinally, our engagement in oncology also continues to make progress, even with limited additional investment, as we primarily focus on commercializing our transplant products. In October, we announced the peer-reviewed [publication](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EzO5--AY5U6keVxEzMbILCd4E0Fw9TC-Wf3XIb_DLxcKq9ByEx8egBjxIz-qTqOOoKP5MAITa7YtHugwiCSqPtqj5_4oEFClsngrdkP15ZjegJfrwpYp-4PI3jW3QvzbNN53r5J3H3fkncqFni-RfhHy9dKmIwkd9F8MiM9qiYgY833_6ZdZEW0MeEDRoNpMGCsrBVGZoHkEsaFNUfyBKw==) of positive data related to our proprietary gene expression test, DetermaIO™.\n\nOur DetermaIO immuno-oncology assay predicted response to the drug atezolizumab in a phase 2 clinical trial, the results of which were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer Research10. In the study, only DetermaIO was both statistically significant and predictive of a pathologic complete response (pCR) among the various biomarkers assessed. This study validated DetermaIO’s utility in identifying which breast cancer patients are most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy and furthered our progress into the multi-billion-dollar addressable market in oncology diagnostics.\n\nWith this publication, DetermaIO continues to solidify its added value over standard-of care biomarkers and assays. The aforementioned study has been included in our CMS submission as we continue our efforts to secure reimbursement coverage to increase access to this valuable test.\n\nWhile we don’t expect to realize meaningful revenue related to our oncology IP within the near term, these studies support partnering discussions with larger companies, support our CMS submission, and validate our research and development pipeline, which is designed to drive sustained rapid growth over the next decade.\n\n**Financing update**\n\nWe continue to prudently manage the inherent tradeoffs between investing for rapid growth and controlling expenses to limit dilutive capital raises ahead of a material potential valuation increase.\n\nOn October 2, we announced that we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement that generated gross proceeds of $10.2 million, before deducting banking and legal fees and other capital raising expenses. We sold 3.46 million11 shares of our common stock in the private placement, which priced _at the market_ at $2.948 per share.\n\nWe were pleased to welcome support from new and existing investors, including Bio-Rad Laboratories, and to be able to finance the company’s continued operations by selling common stock priced at the market, meaning without any discount to the closing price.\n\nWe feel confident in our ability to continue to execute on critical milestones and access capital to fund operations and growth.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Overview**\n\n  * Relative to our strategic objective of commercializing our transplant tests, we consider ourselves to be “pre-revenue.” Our reported revenue of $115,000 in the third quarter was derived from pharma services performed at our clinical laboratory in Nashville.\n  * A gross profit of $50,000 reflected the relatively fixed costs of operating our Nashville laboratory. These costs include labor as well as infrastructure expenses such as the depreciation of laboratory equipment, allocated rent costs, leasehold improvements, and allocated information technology costs.\n  * Operating expenses of $13.6 million included $448,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, $318,000 in non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses and a $7.1 million non-cash expense from the change in fair value of contingent consideration. Excluding these non-cash items in the current and prior periods, our Q3 operating expenses increased approximately 13% sequentially and decreased 8% year over year. \n    * Research and development expenses of $2.8 million reflected the incremental investments we are making in our IVD product launch. Specifically, we increased investment in IVD software development and regulatory consulting expenses in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.\n    * Sales and marketing expenses of $1.0 million reflected added costs as we commercialize our transplant tests. Specifically, we recorded growth in commissions, lease expenses associated with the cost of digital PCR instruments at our customer pilot sites, and incremental travel to newly signed European customers and potential customers.\n    * General and administrative expenses of $2.6 million were roughly flat, reflecting cost discipline as we focus on investing in research and development on IVD product development, and sales and marketing of GraftAssure.\n    * The $7.1 million non-cash expense associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was tied primarily to a decrease in the discount rate percentage used in valuing our transplant intellectual property, due to both macro and micro factors, including the lowered interest rate targets from the Federal Reserve and Oncocyte’s progress toward achieving revenue.\n  * Loss from continuing operations was $13.5 million, or $0.98 share.\n  * Non-GAAP loss from operations was $5.6 million and excludes certain non-cash items. Please refer to the table below, “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure,” for additional information.\n  * Our Q3 2024 per share results reflect 13.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Including the shares issued as part of our October private placement, we currently have 16.8 million shares outstanding.\n  * Oncocyte’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $5.1 million, down $5.9 million sequentially. As mentioned, on October 2, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement. After deducting banking and legal fees and other transaction-related expenses, net proceeds were approximately $9.4 million from the private placement.\n\n\n\nWe are pleased that our third quarter outgoing cash flow from operations (net cash used in operating activities) of $5.55 million came in favorable to our budget of $6 million, which was partially a result of operational efficiency and partly a result of inventory manufacturing timing.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET**\n\nInterested parties may access the live call via telephone by dialing toll free 800-715-9871 for domestic callers.

These statements include those pertaining to, among other things, future expansion and growth, the Company’s land-and-expand strategy to drive commercial adoption of its tests and capture market share, plans to have transplant centers running GraftAssure tests through the end of 2025, projected revenue path, IVD strategy, assumptions regarding regulatory approvals and clearances, timing and planned regulatory submissions, the ongoing global launch of GraftAssure with the support of Bio-Rad Laboratories, our ability to continue to access capital, and other statements about the future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans, or prospects expressed by management. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks inherent in the development and/or commercialization of diagnostic tests or products, uncertainty in the results of clinical trials or regulatory approvals, the capacity of Oncocyte’s third-party supplied blood sample analytic system to provide consistent and precise analytic results on a commercial scale, potential interruptions to supply chains, the need and ability to obtain future capital, maintenance of intellectual property rights in all applicable jurisdictions, obligations to third parties with respect to licensed or acquired technology and products, the need to obtain third party reimbursement for patients’ use of any diagnostic tests Oncocyte or its subsidiaries commercialize in applicable jurisdictions, and risks inherent in strategic transactions such as the potential failure to realize anticipated benefits, legal, regulatory or political changes in the applicable jurisdictions, accounting and quality controls, potential greater than estimated allocations of resources to develop and commercialize technologies, or potential failure to maintain any laboratory accreditation or certification. Actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements and accordingly such statements should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect the business of Oncocyte, particularly those mentioned in the “Risk Factors” and other cautionary statements found in Oncocyte’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, which are available from the SEC’s website. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made.

These statements include, among others, those pertaining to the Oncocyte’s development and commercial model (including margin and cost, reimbursement, revenue and profitability, strategic\npartnerships, market positioning and competitive advantage, global scalability, capital efficiency, accelerated adoption and clinical development), anticipated timing of regulatory clearances, product development and launch\nand milestone opportunities, along with other statements about the future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans, or prospects expressed by management. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including,\nwithout limitation, risks inherent in the development and/or commercialization of diagnostic tests or products, uncertainty in the results of clinical trials or regulatory approvals, the capacity of Oncocyte’s third-party supplied\nblood sample analytic system to provide consistent and precise analytic results on a commercial scale, potential interruptions to supply chains, the need and ability to obtain future capital, maintenance of intellectual property\nrightsinall applicable jurisdictions,obligationstothirdpartieswithrespecttolicensedoracquiredtechnologyandproducts,the needtoobtainthirdpartyreimbursementforpatients’use of anydiagnostic testsOncocyteorits\nsubsidiaries commercialize in applicable jurisdictions, and risks inherent in strategic transactions such as the potential failure to realize anticipated benefits, legal, regulatory or political changes in the applicable jurisdictions,\naccountingandqualitycontrols,potential greater thanestimatedallocationsof resourcestodevelopandcommercialize technologies,orpotential failuretomaintainanylaboratoryaccreditationorcertification.\nOncocyte has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that Oncocyte believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business\nstrategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. Moreover, Oncocyte operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time.\nIt is not possible for Oncocyte’s management to predict all risks, nor can it assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those contained in any forward-lookingstatements the Oncocyte may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed herein may not occur and actual\nresults may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements and accordingly such statements should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect the business of Oncocyte,\nparticularly those mentioned in the “Risk Factors” and other cautionary statements found in Oncocyte’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, which are available from the SEC’s website. Although Oncocyte’s\nmanagement believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company, the placement agent, and their respective representatives, cannot guarantee that the future results, levels\nof activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as\nof the date on which they were made. The Company, the placement agent, and their respective representatives, undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may\nbe made fromtimetotime,whether asaresultof newinformation,futuredevelopmentsorotherwise.\noncocyte.com 2\nWhere\nTomorrow\nLIVES\nM I S S I O N\nDemocratize access to novel\nmolecular diagnostic testing to\nimprove patient outcomes\noncocyte.com 3\nWhere\nTomorrow\nLIVES\nExperienced leadership\nPioneering Molecular Diagnostics & Disruptive Growth\nEkkehard Schütz, MD, Yuh-Min (Johnson) Andrea James\nJosh Riggs\nPHD, FADLM Chiang, PHD\nPresident & Chief Executive\nOfficer Chief Science Officer Chief Technology Officer Chief Financial Officer\noncocyte.com 4\nWhere\nTomorrow\nLIVES\nInnovative science\nmeets simple\nbusiness model\noncocyte.com 5\nWhere\nTomorrow\nLIVES\n• Disruptive approach to molecular diagnostic testing: Empower local\nlabs with kits, versus central lab model\n• Proven credibility in first strategic market: Kidney transplant\nOncocyte\n• Go-to-market strategic partner and equity investment secured\nInvestment\n• Science-driven team, experienced in molecular diagnostics and\nrapid growth\nSummary\n• Full R&D pipeline to fuel growth and portfolio expansion over\nthe next decade\n• IP portfolio attractive to partners and enables value protection\noncocyte.com 6\nWhere\nTomorrow\nLIVES\nWhy invest in molecular diagnostics?\nEmpowers doctors to reduce uncertainty to make better decisions to save lives.\nHigh value creation\nEnables researchers to measure biomarkers to inspire innovation.\nIntellectual property protects our market position, commands high reimbursement\nHigh value capture rates, and therefore, can lead to potential high margins and profitability.

          "content": "ONCOCYTE REPORTS COMMERCIAL LAUNCH PROGRESS; ON TRACK\nTO SIGN 20 TRANSPLANT CENTERS BY END OF 2025\nNov 12, 2024\nTransplant centers representing about 9% of German transplant volumes and about 2% of U.S. transplant volumes have signed on\nto use GraftAssure kitted research test in early launch phase\nFDA pre-submission process for approval of kitted clinical test is underway\nIRVINE, Calif., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncocyte Corporation (Nasdaq: OCX) (“Oncocyte” or the “Company”), a diagnostics\ntechnology company, today published the following letter to shareholders in conjunction with its third quarter results:\nFellow Shareholders,\nWe are pleased to report that we are making considerable progress on two fronts that help de-risk our path to meaningful revenue.\nFirst, we are continuing to sign new research customers at well-respected hospitals and universities. In addition to the two customers\nmentioned in our August update, we have now signed agreements with two leading transplant university hospitals in the U.S. and\nGermany, as well as major research hospitals in Switzerland, Austria, and the U.K. Given the concentrated nature of the transplant\nmarket, we believe each new customer represents a key step toward capturing an estimated $1 billion global total addressable market\nfor our transplant rejection testing technology.\nSecond, our clinical kitted test product development remains on track, and we have already had productive dialogue with the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA), which we describe below.\nThe international response to GraftAssure™, which is our research-use-only assay that can detect early evidence of graft organ damage,\nis exceeding our expectations. We attribute this success to our robust research partnerships in Europe, and to our team’s scientific\nleadership in researching the dd-cfDNA biomarker1 for over a decade. Our customers in Germany now represent about 9% of the\ncountry’s annual organ transplant volumes.2\nAdditionally, we are making inroads toward capturing share in the much larger U.S. market. In August, we reported that our U.S. sales\nfunnel represents 25% of transplant volumes. Three months later, we are pleased to report that hospitals representing about 2% of\noverall organ transplant volumes3 have now signed up to use GraftAssure.\nWe also received significant interest and engagement from the transplant lab community at the American Society for Histocompatibility\n& Immunogenetics (ASHI) conference in Anaheim in October. This continuous positive reinforcement from the customer base gives us\nconfidence that we are on the right track.\nExecutive summary\nOncocyte is at a pivotal stage in commercializing our IP in organ transplant, primarily by making a kitted test that quantifies an\nestablished biomarker, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), and uses a digital-PCR workflow that we believe offers distinct\nadvantages over assays run on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Our scientists have played a pivotal role over the past\ndecade in developing the science that established dd-cfDNA as a trusted biomarker4, and we are now commercializing a product by\npursuing a market disruptive approach. We aim to deliver proven, more affordable, faster tests that can be run at local labs.\nWhile we don’t expect meaningful revenue in transplant rejection testing until we have reached the clinical in-vitro diagnostic (IVD5)\nstage of our kitted product development, we believe that customers who are signing up for GraftAssure RUO are motivated by the\neventual opportunity to use our IVD kits to measure this biomarker in their own labs, capturing the benefit of a rapid response time\nand the ability to generate revenue by running the test.\nWe also can run our clinical-use assay, VitaGraft, at our clinical lab in Nashville. We received Medicare reimbursement on that test in\nAugust 2023.\nStrategic progress\nWe are on track to meet the commitment that we made to investors in August to have more than 20 transplant centers running\nGraftAssure tests through the end of 2025. We estimate that each center represents a potential annual high-margin revenue stream of\nseveral hundred thousand dollars to $2 million of clinical-use tests, depending on the size of the center.\nBy staying science-driven and putting customers first, we are building solid relationships. Deploying our GraftAssure assay is a key part\nof our land-and-expand strategy to drive commercial adoption of our tests.\nWe are especially pleased to report on how quickly we are moving to capture market share. GraftAssure began shipping in June and in\nless than five months, we are well into step two of our land-and-expand strategy. In fact, we have one customer in the U.S. and one\nprominent university hospital in Europe that are progressing to stage three. A simple breakdown:\nLand: Drive market penetration with GraftAssure to build customer install base\n1. Convert sales funnel into signed customers: Either our sales team or Bio-Rad’s, or a combination of both, helps introduce\nour assay to potential academic research customers. Then, we work with institutions to sign agreements to run GraftAssure.\n2. Empower labs to run our assay in-house: Our team provides comprehensive training on the digital-PCR workflow used for\nGraftAssure, which we believe offers distinct advantages over assays run on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology.6\n3. Drive routine use of GraftAssure & reorders: Customer labs begin to run GraftAssure to perform research. Once the lab\nuses up the initial GraftAssure marketing samples, they place orders for additional kits. Initially, we expect kit orders will reflect\nnominal (low revenue) amounts and will increase significantly in the next phase of our strategy.\nExpand: Democratize testing through FDA-cleared VitaGraft+ kit\n4. Obtain regulatory clearance for clinical use: Oncocyte is pursuing IVD clearance from the FDA for VitaGraft+, which is\nbased on the same underlying IP and is similar to GraftAssure. In Europe, we will be pursuing CE Marketing under In Vitro\nDiagnostic Regulation (IVD-R).7\n5. Obtain reimbursement from Medicare and other payors: Shortly after FDA clearance, we expect MolDx to attach a\ncoverage decision to VitaGraft+, making it a reimbursed test. (Note that the version of the test that we run at our Nashville lab\nreceived reimbursement in August 2023).\n6. Begin to generate meaningful revenue: Oncocyte expects to sell about $1 million per year in VitaGraft+ kits to an average\nhospital lab customer, which would order the test to manage its patients in house. Our goal is to enable labs to serve patients\nmore quickly, and to bill payors, thus generating revenue for the hospital and increasing the sustainability of local care for the\ncommunity. To put it simply, we expect our kits would enable the lab to perform the test to generate revenue for the lab.\nTo recap, our strategy is to land major transplant centers and research universities with our research-use-only (RUO) product. Doing so\nestablishes our technology and increases its potential utility by enabling researchers to explore and expand potential applications of\ndd-cfDNA.\nOnce we have achieved FDA clearance for our test kits to be used to make clinical decisions – that is, approved as an IVD – we believe\nthat these institutions will begin using our VitaGraft+ tests to manage their patients, while continuing to use our GraftAssure test kit to\nperform research. Of note, our GraftAssure research product may not be used to support clinical treatment decisions.\nWe are pleased with our strategic progress and our ability to move quickly to establish a customer base to support future revenue\ngrowth. As a reminder of our journey to date: The first prototypes of GraftAssure were completed in December 2023, and by April\n2024, we welcomed Bio-Rad Laboratories as an investor and strategic partner, supporting GraftAssure’s global launch. Under this\npartnership, Bio-Rad and Oncocyte are co-marketing GraftAssure in the U.S. and Germany. Bio-Rad has exclusive distribution and\ncommercial rights of the RUO product outside the U.S. and Germany, with the exception of several major potential international\ncustomers where both companies have mutually agreed to allow Oncocyte to take commercial lead.\nThe transplant market is highly concentrated with fewer than 100 academic and research centers in the U.S. that account for\napproximately 80% of transplant volumes8. Markets outside the U.S. are similarly concentrated within high-end academic institutions.\nBio-Rad’s global infrastructure puts those centers well within reach, allowing for high-touch sales and service in those regions.\nRegulatory update\nWe are pleased to report that our FDA pre-submission remains on track. Since our last quarterly update, we have cleared the first stage\ngate in our clinical product development process and submitted a Q-Sub to the FDA.\nSpecifically, Oncocyte has submitted its plan for an IVD version of the dd-cfDNA kitted test to the FDA, beginning the Q-submission\nprocess. We already have begun to engage in productive dialogue with the FDA, and a meeting is scheduled for early December in\nconnection with the submission. The Q-sub is a formal pathway for companies to get written feedback on their development plan and\nis a critical step in gaining confidence in the validation process that we expect to begin in early 2025.\nAs a reminder, the IVD development process occurs in three phases, culminating in FDA submission. Since our August update, we have\ncompleted Phase 1: Planning and Inputs. We are currently in Phase 2: Design and Outputs and will proceed with Phase 3: Verification\nand Validation thereafter.\nMeanwhile, we also are thrilled to report that several hospitals have expressed interest in supporting the FDA submission process. Six\nhospitals or clinics, all of which are in major cities (given the highly concentrated nature of the transplant market) have expressed\ninterest in participating in our clinical observational study. In addition, four institutions have expressed interest in participating in the\nreproducibility study. We believe these sites represent potential future VitaGraft+ customers.\nThe clinical director of one transplant center, who expressed interest in supporting our FDA submission, told us that his transplant\ncenter would benefit from having access to a kitted product. Because Oncocyte’s kitted test is run on a digital PCR instrument9, our\nFDA-cleared tests will be designed to provide actionable information when the time to treat is critical. “In a for-cause setting, send out\ntesting doesn’t do me any good,” the clinical director said. “I cannot wait for two days.”\nScientific update\nWe continue to advance the science of dd-cfDNA and demonstrate its clinical value.\nOn August 11, Transplant Internationalpublished a review that concluded that dd-cfDNA is a valuable, non-invasive biomarker that\nenhances graft surveillance and personalized therapy for patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), potentially improving\noutcomes and reducing premature graft loss.\nAlso in August, we announced a case series that represented the second study showing VitaGraft Kidney as a measure of response to\nthe benefit of therapy on AMR, which is a leading cause of allograft failure. The case series study, involving two patients, underscored\nthe significant potential of using repeated VitaGraft Kidney measurements to monitor the efficacy of a targeted therapy drug, in this\ncase, daratumumab.\nThe daratumumab study represented the second publication this year that showed Oncocyte’s ability to monitor therapeutic efficacy.\nIn the phase 2 randomized controlled trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2024, VitaGraft Kidney was also\nused to measure the response to the drug felzartamab for patients with AMR after kidney transplantation.\nThese papers’ authors included Oncocyte’s Chief Science Officer, Ekke Schuetz, and Senior R&D Director, Julia Beck.\nWe believe that the growing body of literature around the dd-cfDNA biomarker should support claims expansion, which we expect to\ntranslate to an increase in our total addressable market. Within the coming years, we expect to see claims expansion regarding using\ndd-cfDNA to monitor DSA+ patients, in the application of anti-CD38 drugs, as described above with daratumumab and felzartamab,\nand claims expansion to monitoring for minimal residual disease (MRD) in transplant rejection. Notably, in October, felzartamab\nreceived Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from FDA for the treatment of late AMR in kidney transplant patients.\nFinally, our engagement in oncology also continues to make progress, even with limited additional investment, as we primarily focus\non commercializing our transplant products. In October, we announced the peer-reviewed publication of positive data related to our\nproprietary gene expression test, DetermaIO™.\nOur DetermaIO immuno-oncology assay predicted response to the drug atezolizumab in a phase 2 clinical trial, the results of which\nwere published in the peer-reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer Research10. In the study, only DetermaIO was both statistically significant\nand predictive of a pathologic complete response (pCR) among the various biomarkers assessed. This study validated DetermaIO’s\nutility in identifying which breast cancer patients are most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy and furthered our\nprogress into the multi-billion-dollar addressable market in oncology diagnostics.\nWith this publication, DetermaIO continues to solidify its added value over standard-of care biomarkers and assays. The\naforementioned study has been included in our CMS submission as we continue our efforts to secure reimbursement coverage to\nincrease access to this valuable test.\nWhile we don’t expect to realize meaningful revenue related to our oncology IP within the near term, these studies support partnering\ndiscussions with larger companies, support our CMS submission, and validate our research and development pipeline, which is\ndesigned to drive sustained rapid growth over the next decade.\nFinancing update\nWe continue to prudently manage the inherent tradeoffs between investing for rapid growth and controlling expenses to limit dilutive\ncapital raises ahead of a material potential valuation increase.\nOn October 2, we announced that we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement that generated gross\nproceeds of $10.2 million, before deducting banking and legal fees and other capital raising expenses. We sold 3.46 million11 shares of\nour common stock in the private placement, which priced at the market at $2.948 per share.\nWe were pleased to welcome support from new and existing investors, including Bio-Rad Laboratories, and to be able to finance the\ncompany’s continued operations by selling common stock priced at the market, meaning without any discount to the closing price.\nWe feel confident in our ability to continue to execute on critical milestones and access capital to fund operations and growth.\nQ3 2024 Financial Overview\nRelative to our strategic objective of commercializing our transplant tests, we consider ourselves to be “pre-revenue.” Our reported\nrevenue of $115,000 in the third quarter was derived from pharma services performed at our clinical laboratory in Nashville.\nA gross profit of $50,000 reflected the relatively fixed costs of operating our Nashville laboratory. These costs include labor as well\nas infrastructure expenses such as the depreciation of laboratory equipment, allocated rent costs, leasehold improvements, and\nallocated information technology costs.\nOperating expenses of $13.6 million included $448,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, $318,000 in non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expenses and a $7.1 million non-cash expense from the change in fair value of contingent\nconsideration. Excluding these non-cash items in the current and prior periods, our Q3 operating expenses increased\napproximately 13% sequentially and decreased 8% year over year.\nResearch and development expenses of $2.8 million reflected the incremental investments we are making in our IVD product\nlaunch. Specifically, we increased investment in IVD software development and regulatory consulting expenses in the third\nquarter compared with the second quarter.\nSales and marketing expenses of $1.0 million reflected added costs as we commercialize our transplant tests. Specifically, we\nrecorded growth in commissions, lease expenses associated with the cost of digital PCR instruments at our customer pilot\nsites, and incremental travel to newly signed European customers and potential customers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $2.6 million were roughly flat, reflecting cost discipline as we focus on investing in\nresearch and development on IVD product development, and sales and marketing of GraftAssure.\nThe $7.1 million non-cash expense associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was\ntied primarily to a decrease in the discount rate percentage used in valuing our transplant intellectual property, due to both\nmacro and micro factors, including the lowered interest rate targets from the Federal Reserve and Oncocyte’s progress toward\nachieving revenue.\nLoss from continuing operations was $13.5 million, or $0.98 share.\nNon-GAAP loss from operations was $5.6 million and excludes certain non-cash items. Please refer to the table below,\n“Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure,” for additional information.\nOur Q3 2024 per share results reflect 13.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Including the shares issued as part of our\nOctober private placement, we currently have 16.8 million shares outstanding.\nOncocyte’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance at the end of the third quarter was approximately $5.1 million,\ndown $5.9 million sequentially. As mentioned, on October 2, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private\nplacement. After deducting banking and legal fees and other transaction-related expenses, net proceeds were approximately $9.4\nmillion from the private placement.\nWe are pleased that our third quarter outgoing cash flow from operations (net cash used in operating activities) of $5.55 million came\nin favorable to our budget of $6 million, which was partially a result of operational efficiency and partly a result of inventory\nmanufacturing timing.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nConference Call and Webcast on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET\nInterested parties may access the live call via telephone by dialing toll free 800-715-9871 for domestic callers.

Josh, you may begin.\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Julie. Welcome everyone and thanks for tuning in. The transplant market is changing, and\nOncocyte is a leading force in that change. Transplant centers around the world are realizing that they\ndo not have to accept the limitations of the current molecular testing model. In Q3, we worked with our\nbeta sites to bring up our tests and we're able to celebrate our technology being run on 3 continents. We\nsigned up leading transplant centers in our key markets, built upon our market leadership and clinical data\ngeneration, and took the first major steps in our FDA program. Milestone after milestone, promise after\npromise, we continue to deliver. 1.5 ago, we told the market that it was time to democratize transplant\ntesting and today, we are closer than ever to making that goal a global reality. The positive response from\nthe transplant community tells us that we are on the right path, and that we can count on their support to\nmake our IVD product a reality, because at the end of the day local care can mean better care for patients.\nMaking dd-cfDNA testing broadly accessible means more research can be done, new questions will be\nanswered, and progress will start to accelerate in the clinic. Transplant centers are tired of being left\nout of this important piece in the patient care value chain. They want to manage their patients locally\nand we believe that they should be able to participate in the economic value they create. Oncocyte is\ncommitted to enabling both. Fast, easy-to-use tests with strong revenue potential are a no-brainer for\nmost transplant centers across U.S. This is the future they want and the ones they'll get. It feels gratifying\nto be able to report such great progress every quarter. We are retiring risk on our path to meaningful\nrevenue. Demand for our GraftAssure RUO kit test is exceeding our expectations in Europe. And in the\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nU.S., we believe, we are carving out potential meaningful market share, while also staying on pace with\nour FDA program. We are moving quickly and that's a testament to the team's dedication and hard work,\nour shareholder support, and the market enthusiasm for what we're building.\nShortly after launching GraftAssure, we signed a top 5 transplant center here in the United States and a\ntop 5 transplant center in Germany. In the long run, democratization of transplant testing is inevitable.\nWhat we are seeing here is just the first sign of the beginning. Just think, basically every other biomarker\nneeded to manage a transplant patient can be measured locally, except for dd-cfDNA. And there's no good\nreason that dd-cfDNA should be any different. Transplant is a highly concentrated market and the top\nof our sales funnel skews towards the largest of the 100 transplant centers that matter the most in our\nspace. We are actively talking to more than 30 sites that do high organ transplant volumes. We believe we\nare on track to meet or exceed our site placement goal of having 20 sites signed by the end of next year.\nWe believe each of these sites can eventually average about $1 million per year in high-margin recurring\nclinical test kit revenue. So it's not hard to do the times 1 math, on how we think revenue will build once\nwe achieve FDA clearance for our kits to be used in clinical decision making. And, of course, that's just\nthe starting point. We expect that the value proposition and regulatory clearance will drive accelerated\nadoption in both the U.S. and the EU.\nWe've engaged with the FDA and we'll have our first meeting with them in early December to go through\nour validation plan. We have a team of experienced hands that have put many products and devices\nthrough the agency. And I have every confidence that we will find an efficient path to success. In\nrecent weeks, I've spent a fair amount of time meeting face-to-face with many stakeholders in our\nindustry, including customers and research partners, and companies in our space, who are interested in\nstrategically partnering. I've traveled to meet with customers and partners, not only in the U.S., but also\nin Europe. We are leaning into the long-standing relationships we already have while we build and explore\nnew potential commercial and strategic relationships. It seems like every stone we lift up, we're finding\nsomeone who is frustrated with the current industry practice and is looking to us for a better way.\nOur customers are telling us that our product is both easy-to-use and fast, and we believe that, that\nsets us apart. If you can extract DNA, then most likely you can run our tests. And for centers that want\nsame-day turnaround time, our digital PCR-based assay offers an advantage over NGS solutions. We\nbelieve we are pursuing a form of the classic technological disruption strategy of introducing products that\nfundamentally change the nature of competition in a given market.\nOn the strategic side, we believe our IP gives us a seat at the table in the broader molecular diagnostic\nspace, which will allow us to have productive conversations with strategic players, both on the product\nside, such as the instrument makers, as well as with clinical service labs. And our IP has value, not only in\ntransplant, which currently gets most of our strategic focus and sales investment, but also in oncology. We\nbelieve we can continue to drive growth even after transplant is up and humming for us.\nI do want to highlight favorable data out of Milan related to one of our oncology products. DetermaIO,\nan immune classifier, continues to outperform standard of care biomarkers and assays. A peer-reviewed\nstudy published in Clinical Cancer Research in September validated DetermaIO's utility to identify breast\ncancer patients most likely to benefit from atezolizumab. The takeaway for investors is threefold. Firstly,\nthis study gets us 1 step closer to reimbursement for DetermaIO and we plan to add this to our data\nsubmission at CMS. Secondly, the data supports our ongoing DetermaIO partnering conversations. We\nbelieve we have identified partners who want market access to this technology on a global basis. And\nfinally, it validates our R&D pipeline and shows our continuing progress in targeting a multibillion dollar\naddressable market in oncology diagnostics.\nEven though we are a small company and we are still largely pre-revenue in transplant, we sit upon an\nestablished body of science and more than 10 years of research in the field. We believe we have long\nbeen out in front with the clinical data that we are generating and have a strong pipeline to power new\nopportunities and growth well into the future.\nI'll hand it over to Andrea.\nAndrea Susan James\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Josh. Hi, everyone. You'll notice in the shareholder letter that, we highlighted 2 areas of focus\nto derisk our path to meaningful revenue. Those 2 areas are: One, signing new customers who should\nturn on nicely for us after we get FDA clearance for our kits; and 2, preparing that FDA submission, so\nwe can achieve clearance and those customers can start buying our kits to manage their patients. In\nthe meantime, while Josh and the rest of the senior leadership team focus on serving customers and\nadvancing the science in our industry, my team and I are focused on capital allocation. And this includes\ntightly controlling expenses, as well as ensuring access to capital to give us enough runway to get us\nto where we are self-sustaining. Last month, we raised $10.2 million in gross proceeds in a private\nplacement. We were thrilled to welcome support from existing investors, including our strategic partner\nBio-Rad. We also welcome support from new investors. We raised this capital at the market with no\ndiscount to the closing price and we raised it in a tough environment.\nI believe that we were able to accomplish this because investors can see the opportunity for us to\ngenerate healthy returns on their behalf. We expect that growth capital allows us to keep executing on\nnew customer agreements and keep pursuing FDA clearance. That capital also provides runway for us to\ncontinue actively pursuing additional strategic partners. We're growing increasingly excited about the long-\nterm.\nJosh has stated for several quarters that molecular diagnostic testing, particularly in transplant, is moving\naway from a centralized lab solution and toward a kitted solution. We believe that this disruption is going\nto happen and that Oncocyte can be a key driver of this trend for 3 reasons. First, our researchers have\nhad a seat at the table since the beginning scientifically in establishing the donor-derived cell-free DNA\nbiomarker. We are now simply seeking a commercial seat at the table, which is no easy feat, but we\nbelieve that the science is behind us and the science is the hardest part.\nSecond, our digital PCR assay is a differentiator because it's easier to use and gives a faster result.\nWe believe that the existence of a digital PCR kitted transplant test with reimbursement enables our\ncustomer labs to participate in the economic value chain of transplant diagnostic testing. Remember, we\nare aiming to design test kits to enable centers to perform the tests themselves and generate revenue\nfor themselves. This increases the sustainability of care at the local level. It can also better serve patients\nwith fast results.\nAnd third, we are small and nimble and we can adapt quickly. We have relatively low operating expenses\nand we strive to keep our cash burn low, so we can stay flexible.\nFinally, we are focused on ensuring we have the right people and processes in place to prepare for future\nscale. Last week, we gathered as a senior leadership team at our Nashville Innovation Center. Our goal\nwas to prepare for our upcoming growth and think strategically about our long-term objectives. We came\nout of those planning sessions energized to keep executing and keep building. We're looking forward to\ndelivering upon our mission to democratize access to molecular diagnostic testing, as well as creating\nshareholder value along the way.\nOkay. Julie, do we have any questions in the queue?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nJulie Silber\nYes, we do. We have our first question from our analyst, Mike Matson from Needham. I'm assuming we\ncan put you on speaker.\nJoseph Scott Conway\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nThis is Joseph on for Mike. Yes, can you guys hear me?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes.\nJoseph Scott Conway\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Maybe just starting off with the first one. If you guys can maybe discuss the role that Bio-Rad is\nplaying here over the next year and change, I guess, before a potential FDA approval? Are you seeing\nassistance from them in opening up dialogue with these transplant centers or maybe individual physicians?\nSo, I guess, is there any assistance marketing the RUO product? Or do you think their role will be more\nrobust?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, I think it's a great question. And I answer it in 2 parts. I think we've got really nice experience here in\nthe U.S. and really, really good support over in Germany. We were over there about a month ago and we\ngot to sit down with their Head of Central Europe and the commercial team. And they're absolutely excited\nto support us and they've been opening doors left and right for us in Central Europe. They have really\nstrong relationships as you might imagine, as a research, at least on the research side of their company\nwith labs all across the countries that we're targeting. And so, that relationship has been very helpful for\nus. It gives us a feeling of being a heck of a lot bigger than we are. So when we go and set up a site, they\nalso have, the Bio-Rad reps standing right there alongside, our team. And so, it feels like there's a really\nnice handoff in that relationship, and it gives the labs a lot of comfort. And I'd say in the U.S., they've\ncertainly opened doors where we don't have reach today. And so, it's been fruitful for us, I would say. And\nit gives us a lot more credibility than when we're standing at a transplant conference and most recently\nover at ASHI, Bio-Rad was there with us. They had -- their life science team was in the booth with us,\ngiving confidence to folks that when they're talking to us, they're going to get the backing of $9 billion\ncompany. And so, yes, 100% we've felt that support.\nJoseph Scott Conway\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Yes. That's great to hear and very helpful. And then, I guess, just -- it's early days and what have\nyou, but maybe just on the reception of the workflow for GraftAssure that you have introduced to the\nphysicians thus far in this first phase. Are you seeing a lot of your reps or Bio-Rad reps dedicating a lot\nof time to teach how to run GraftAssure? Or would you say that the teaching process has been a little bit\nmore intuitive given the type of PCR-based assay?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nNo. I think it's an insightful question. Most folks that are trained on molecular are trained on PCR\ntechnology. And so, a lot of people just come with that kind of skill set to a molecular lab. So that, I\nwould say, the workflow is not foreign to most people. It is -- there is -- there are nuances to the Bio-Rad\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nplatform that we have to train on. But I would say in general, it takes us about a week to 2 weeks to get\nfolks up and going and comfortable with the technology to where they're generating their own data. And\nthe way we've been working with our first group is, they're sending data to us on a daily basis and we're\ngoing through it with them, making sure that they're comfortable. We're learning about our assay and\nhow it performs in the field. But we haven't experienced any meaningful challenges in just sort of the pure\ntechnology itself. It seems to be fairly easy to adopt and get set up and run.\nJoseph Scott Conway\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Perfect. And maybe just one more, if that's all right. Could you maybe just discuss the value that\nthe VitaGraft adds, especially to high-risk transplant patients? And just kind of understanding where\nsome of the clinical volume can come from. Do you expect that VitaGraft will be used among a subset\nof patients, maybe the high-risk individuals that kind of need that test result in a much more expedited\nmanner? Or do you think by the time that these hospitals are trialed GraftAssure that they would be more\napt to transition to VitaGraft more broadly or to a broader patient set?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I'm going to separate the question into 2 parts. So the GraftAssure assay is our RUO product. And\nso, that's not really useful for the clinical population. But once we get to the IVD product, which we expect\nto call VitaGraft+, yes, there's probably a handful of patients that need immediate testing. And then\nthe majority of the patients who -- there's some little blip on the clinical radar that the doctor wants to\ninvestigate. I would say that the transplant center will be heavily incentivized economically to capture\nand run as much testing as they can in-house. And I think that will be the primary driver of the switch\nfrom send out to in-house testing. But, yes, we really -- like, the market hasn't experienced same-day\nturnaround time on testing. And so, we don't know all of the use cases that could be there. I don't know if\nthat answers your question, but I would expect that if I had an opportunity to build into the thousands for\na test that I would want to do that as often as I could when it's clinically needed.\nJoseph Scott Conway\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Yes. I think that makes perfect sense. I think common sense and the test will be helpful there. But\nsince it's novel, it's more of a wait and see. That's all very helpful.\nJulie Silber\nThe next set of questions I'm assuming comes from our analyst, Mason Carrico from Stephens Inc.\nBenjamin Henry Mee\nStephens Inc., Research Division\nThis is Ben on for Mason today. You guys have talked about transplant centers reaching out to you\nproactively to get access to the RUO product without direct sales outreach from your end. Could you sort\nof provide an update on how that's playing out? And then are there any specific use cases or research\ninitiatives that you think are a better product fit for yours versus maybe competing offerings?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nOh gosh, I love the question. So the first thing I'll say is, we got outreach from a pediatric unit, not based\nhere in the U.S. And they were working with their patients and they were sending blood, all the way\nacross the ocean to some labs in California trying to get an answer and it was taking them a month to\nget a result back. And so, when we went over there and set up, they had their entire team there, they\nhad the adult team in the room and they had the Bio-Rad rep standing there and we all worked together\nfor about 1.5 weeks on getting them comfortable with the technology and showing that they could do\nthis in-house. And as of today, they're up and running and they're figuring out how to take care of their\npatient population locally and being able to manage those patients, those children right there. And I think\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nthat's for us a huge win that we know that we're empowering people that didn't have the access that they\nneeded to this type of testing.\nBeyond that, I think, we've been publishing over the past couple of months in anti-CD38 drugs. So these\nare drugs that are supporting patients or helping patients with antibody-mediated rejection. And so far,\nI mean, we are way out in front of the rest of the world here on publishing data that says that donor-\nderived cell-free DNA is useful. We're also anticipating publication that shows that we're able to pick\nup antibody-mediated rejection 10 months ahead using the absolute quantification that's native to our\ntechnology. And so, I think there are very clear use cases that we're developing that are sort of on the\nkind of the cutting edge of what's possible with donor-derived cell-free DNA. Whether it's only doable with\nour technology or other technologies will catch up, I can't really say today. But I do believe that we are\nopening new markets with the science that we're doing.\nBenjamin Henry Mee\nStephens Inc., Research Division\nGreat. Really appreciate the backdrop there. Just a quick follow-up on the RUO product there. When\nyou're in discussions with the transplant centers, can you speak to who are the decision makers in terms\nof whether that product is getting adopted? And then really just if you could share any of the common\npushbacks that you may hear for why this product may not be the best fit for them and how you go about\naddressing that pushback?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nSure. I'd say, you're going to need buy in from someone on the transplant side of the house. So if you\nthink about you have a lab manager and then you have a transplant center manager, you really need both\nof them together to get to, yes on this. And so, we're looking for the transplant surgeons or nephrologists,\nwho are research-minded, who have questions that they've been wanting to ask, but haven't been able to\nbecause of the current structure and the availability of testing. And then they go talk to the lab manager\nand say, ''Hey, we should really consider bringing this technology in-house. We have this, that, or the\nother study that we would really like to run on our patients.'' And then that's what really kicks off the\nprocess. And so, it's really it's a 2-part sale there.\nThe hurdle that we have is -- I mean, it's one that's kind of painfully obvious when you're trying to sell a\nbox into a lab is that, this is the first piece of content that's coming out on the QX600 for the transplant\nlab. And so, you you're trying to work through adoption of a new instrument into a lab that has 1 piece\nof content. And so, the value proposition has to be pretty strong to make that sale happen. I think so far\nwe've felt a little bit of that pushback, but I think the demand to have access to technology so far has\nbeen winning the day.\nJulie Silber\nThe next question comes from Mark Massaro from BTIG.\nVidyun Bais\nBTIG, LLC, Research Division\nThis is actually Vivian on for Mark. So I understand that you're meeting with the FDA shortly. I guess,\nwhat -- could you just provide some clarity on what's your supporting FDA pivotal study? And additionally,\ndo you plan on doing any concordance studies to on-market transplant tests? I think I heard you talk\nabout identifying AMR with 10 months of lead time over other tests. So maybe just some more discussion\non when you would expect that publication?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, great. So, I've got the -- what's going on with the publication relative to AMR detection, and then\nthe conversation with the FDA. So I'll take the FDA one first and then I'll go to the AMR question. I think\nit was about 1.5 months, 2 months ago, we submitted our validation plan into the FDA. And basically,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nwe're looking at a Class II device here. So we're not looking at PMA. So that means that we're on track for\nclearance, not approval. And so, it's not a binary decision point.\nAnd I think we're doing a relatively simple study here. We're looking at biopsy as the gold standard and\ndoing a blood draw matched to biopsy and showing in the data how good of a job we do in identifying\ngraft damage in the blood. And that seems to be a fairly straightforward study design. We've got a lot of\nconfidence that it will provide the data that we need to give the FDA confidence that we have a reliable\nassay, which at the end of the day is kind of the most important piece. We're only going in kidney to\nstart off. I expect that once we have success there that we would do follow on submissions in the major\ntransplant types like heart or lung or liver. But right now, we're focusing on the biggest piece of the\nmarket, which is clearly the kidney patient population.\nAnd with that -- I just want to make sure before I go on, did that answer all your questions around kind of\nthe FDA program?\nVidyun Bais\nBTIG, LLC, Research Division\nYes, that was perfect.\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nOkay, great. And then, so the data that's going to publish is the data we presented back at ESOT, I believe\nthis was last year and so the European Society of Transplantation, we showed in an interventional study,\nand this is kind of important. We -- these patients were randomized and then they were ruled in for biopsy\nbased off of our assay. And this is the first time anybody has run an interventional study using donor-\nderived cell-free DNA to decide when to do a biopsy. Normally, this test is used to rule out, right, because\nyou're trying to avoid biopsies that aren't necessary. And in this scenario, we're saying these patients need\na biopsy because it's highly likely that they have antibody-mediated rejection. And so, that's the study\nthat's going to come out.\nWe're excited about it because I think it dovetails really well with the data that we've been publishing\non the anti-CD38 drugs, felzartamab and daratumumab. And so, this is the drug that's now owned by\nBiogen and then J&J's drug. And so, that becomes important, like, if you have a drug that can actually\ntreat [Technical Difficulty] antibody-mediated rejection, it's important to catch it as early as possible,\nbecause the time loss here is graft loss. And so, there's going to be a lot of push to catch AMR as early as\npossible, so that you can get these patients on treatment as soon as possible to avoid significant damage\nto the kidney and eventual graft loss or death or they're going to have to go back on dialysis. There's like\na whole lot of bad outcomes that could be avoided if you can catch the AMR earlier. And we've got, what I\nbelieve is the best data out there. Certainly, the only interventional data that's out there showing that you\ncan catch it early enough to actually have an impact with these drugs.\nVidyun Bais\nBTIG, LLC, Research Division\nThat was perfect. Josh, and then, maybe just a follow-up on the U.S. sales funnel. I think you called out\nthat this is 25% of transplant volumes. Just how long do you think that's going to take to convert that to\nrevenue after securing FDA approval? And just what steps you've taken to prepare for launch there?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. Let me take a second to think on that one. So, Andrea put together a really nice chart in our last\nshareholder letter, where we put out some thinking on what adoption could look like inside a major\ntransplant center. And we don't expect that physicians are overnight going to just jump in and use our\ntechnology on 100% of the time on 100% of their patients. There's going to be some kind of lead-\nin period. We're assuming about a 6-month or 2-quarter lead-in from the point of time when they've\nadopted the IVD product to where you'll see a meaningful switch from sending out primarily to doing\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nthings in-house. I think that may happen faster in the centers where they're already comfortable with our\ntechnology and that's where I think our pilot sites matter a lot. But I think for the new adopters, the ones\nthat are adopting very close to the time when we have FDA clearance are sort of like immediately after,\nthere's going to be a lead-in period. But I wouldn't expect it to last much longer than 6 to 9 months as\nthey're kind of exploring how to work that in. And then after that the argument to send out gets rather\ntenuous, just because you'll be able to do it yourself. It's a heck of a lot easier to send a tube of blood\ndown the hall than it is to send it across the country.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And Julie, I'll turn the call back to you for the pre-submitted question.\nJulie Silber\nSure. We have 1 question that came in via e-mail and the question is, can you explain why people\nwouldn't just use the NGS tests that are already out there?\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I love this question, and I think, Ekke is probably a really good person to answer this one for us. So,\nyes. So, Ekke, if you can take the question on why wouldn't you just run the NGS test?\nEkkehard Schutz\nChief Science Officer\nYes. Thank you for the question. I really like it. So, we have developed the -- our test on digital PCR for\ngood reasons. And I start with the fact that digital PCR is way faster than what you ever can do with\nsequencing that right now with the current technology that is out there is taking up to like 24, 30 hours\nbefore you can even have a result. And that really limit all these NGS technology to situations where the\ndoctor doesn't need an immediate answer. So for all indications where the doctor wants to know what am\nI going to do, the NGS tests are not really feasible. So that was actually the reason why we went into that\ndirection and we started developing the test.\nThe second reason is that, if you're looking at NGS, the sequencing alone comprises a high cost factor.\nSo what labs need to do is to wait until they have enough samples together that they can put on one run\nof the NGS machine. So that's actually almost the same thing because it's all about timing. So you can\njust run 1 sample that is very urgent in your lab based on NGS. Our test is different. It doesn't matter\nwhether you're running 1 sample or 10 sample. The percent of costs are actually the same. So it's all\nreally patient-driven. If you need a fast result or a critical situation in the patient, NGS does not serve you.\nSo that's the major reason why we were going into the direction of a PCR technology where you can easily\nget the results within 1 working day.\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you for that, Ekke. And I think that, that nails it, because I think most centers are going to struggle\nwith the idea that they have to batch to get their costs down because there's always going to be a couple\nof cases a week where you're going to want a quick answer. And that's just not a great place for NGS\ntechnology to serve.\nAll right. Do we have anything else in the question queue there, Julie?\nJulie Silber\nNo more questions from where I can see.\nJoshua Riggs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.
