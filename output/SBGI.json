(Nasdaq: SBGI), the “Company” or “Sinclair,” today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * Solid third quarter results, with core advertising revenues growing by 1% year-over-year during a quarter with record political revenues\n  * Political revenues of $138 million, a 31% increase over 2020 levels, which was impacted by $5 million of lost revenue due to late ad cancellations during the quarter\n  * Approximately $406 million in 2024 political revenues, which reflects $26 million of lost revenue due to a late geographic shift of existing commitments to non-Sinclair markets\n  * Distribution revenues in the third quarter up 5% year-over-year as 78% of our Big 4 network MVPD linear subscriber base are now subject to new retransmission consent agreements this year\n  * Third Quarter adjusted EBITDA in-line with guidance range\n  * Full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance range reflects a year-over-year increase of 54% to 56%\n\n\n\n**CEO Comment:**\n\n“Sinclair delivered solid third quarter results, as core advertising revenues grew by 1% year-over-year, in spite of record-breaking political revenues,” commented Chris Ripley, Sinclair’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This is unprecedented for Sinclair in recent history and perhaps the industry to be able to grow core advertising revenues in the third quarter of a political year. Total advertising revenue was up 42% year-over-year and distribution revenues grew by 5%. We have now reached agreement to renew retransmission consent agreements covering 78% of our Big 4 network MVPD linear subscriber base this year and we are confident in our ability to grow net retransmission revenues in line with our prior mid-single-digit CAGR estimate from 2023-2025. Our industry-leading core advertising revenue trends, and with most of our retrans and network affiliation agreement renewals now behind us, we believe we are well-positioned to finish 2024 on a strong note.”\n\n**Recent Company Developments:**\n\n**Content and Distribution:**\n\n  * In August and September, the Company expanded its podcast division, launching a new slate of sports programming featuring top athletes, coaches, and experts including “The Triple Option,” hosted by Urban Meyer, Mark Ingram II, and Rob Stone and “Throwbacks” with Matt Leinart and Jerry Ferrara. The podcasts have both consistently ranked among Apple’s top-10 sports podcasts.\n  * In October, the Company announced the launch of a soccer-focused podcast, “Unfiltered Soccer with Landon and Tim,” featuring former U.S. soccer stars Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.\n  * In the third quarter, the Company entered into a multi-year renewal with Altice USA for continued carriage of Sinclair’s broadcast stations, Tennis Channel, and the YES Network on Altice’s Optimum and Suddenlink owned systems.\n  * In the third quarter, the Company entered into a multi-year renewal with DIRECTV for continued carriage of Sinclair’s broadcast stations, Tennis Channel, Marquee Sports Network, and the YES Network across DIRECTV, DIRECTV Stream and U-verse.\n  * In October, the Company launched the Rip City Television Network, a network of Sinclair affiliates throughout the Pacific Northwest to serve as the new television home of Trail Blazers starting with the 2024-25 season.\n  * Year-to-date, Sinclair’s newsrooms have won a total of 196 journalism awards, including 24 RTDNA Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards for Outstanding Journalism and 24 regional Emmy awards.\n\n\n\n**Community:**\n\n  * In October, the Company ran Sinclair Cares: Hurricane Relief, a fundraising partnership with the Salvation Army and The United Way to assist with humanitarian relief efforts on the ground in Western North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Virginia and Tennessee in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors by allowing them to view the Company’s business through the eyes of management and is a measure that is frequently used by industry analysts, investors and lenders as a measure of relative operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided on a forward-looking basis under the section entitled “Outlook” above. The Company has not included a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods presented in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company’s projected Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict including, but not limited to, income taxes. Due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from projected Adjusted EBITDA in future periods, management does not rely upon them for internal use or measurement of operating performance, and therefore cannot create a quantitative projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income reconciliation for the periods presented without unreasonable efforts. A quantitative reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented would imply a degree of precision and certainty as to these future items that does not exist and could be confusing to investors. From a qualitative perspective, it is anticipated that the differences between projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented will consist of items similar to those described in the reconciliation of historical results below. The timing and amount of any of these excluded items could significantly impact the Company’s net income for a particular period. When planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, the Company does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis.\n\nIn addition to the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, below, the Company also discloses a reconciliation of the Adjusted EBITDA of its segments to its more directly comparable GAAP measure, segment operating income.\n\nNon-GAAP measures are not formulated in accordance with GAAP, are not meant to replace GAAP financial measures and may differ from other companies’ uses or formulations. Further discussions and reconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on its website [www.sbgi.net](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbgi.net&esheet=54148172&newsitemid=20241106722904&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sbgi.net&index=4&md5=38826e2ff7086eabe249b943f74b1aac).\n\n**Sinclair, Inc. and Subsidiaries** **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements – Unaudited** **_All periods reclassified to conform with current year GAAP presentation and Adjusted EBITDA definitional change due to routine SEC comment process_** **(in millions)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Reconciliation of Consolidated Sinclair, Inc.

Increases Third Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Political Revenue Expectations; Reiterates Prior Net Retrans Forecast**\n\n09.19.2024\n\nBALTIMORE – Sinclair, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBGI), the “Company,” today announced that it is increasing its advertising guidance for the third quarter 2024 to account for stronger-than-expected political revenues. The Company’s updated expectation for third quarter political advertising revenue is approximately $140 million to $145 million, up from the previously announced forecast range of $113 million to $128 million. Expectations for Local Media segment third quarter core advertising revenue are $285 million to $293 million, with the midpoint down slightly compared to the previously announced forecast range of $288 million to $300 million, due to crowd-out from the increased political advertising. The updated expectation represents Local Media segment core advertising growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. In total, the Company now anticipates Local Media advertising revenue during the third quarter to be within a range of $425 million to $438 million, up from the expectation of a range of $401 million to $428 million, as previously provided on August 7, 2024. \n\nThe Company’s updated full-year political revenue expectation is now $442 million to $469 million, up from the previously-disclosed forecast range of $385 million to $410 million. \n\nRecent retransmission agreement renewal activity has been in-line with expectations and the Company is reaffirming its previously provided 2-year compounded annualized mid-single digit percent growth rate for net retrans from 2023 through 2025. \n\nThe Company will provide financial and operating results for the third quarter 2024 on Wednesday, November 6, 2024. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n\nThe matters discussed in this news release, particularly those in the section labeled “Outlook,” include forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, future operating results.

financial measures as supplemental financial data to assist management and the public in their analysis and valuation of our company. These measures are not formulated in accordance with GAAP, are not meant to replace GAAP financial measures and may differ from other companies’ uses or formulations. Further discussions and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures are provided via the hyperlink below.We do not provide reconciliations on a forward-looking basis in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Our projected Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict including, but not limited to, income taxes. Due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from projected Adjusted EBITDA in future periods, management does not rely upon them for internal use or measurement of operating performance, and therefore cannot create a quantitative projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income reconciliation for the periods presented without unreasonable efforts. A quantitative reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income would imply a degree of precision and certainty as to these future items that does not exist and could be confusing to investors. From a qualitative perspective, it is anticipated that the differences between projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income will consist of items similar to those described in the reconciliation of our most recent historical results. The timing and amount of any of these excluded items could significantly impact our net income (loss) for a particular period. When planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, we do so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis.**Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA):** Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP operating performance measure that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our operating performance and for executive compensation purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and is a measure that is frequently used by industry analysts, investors and lenders as a measure of valuation. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the basis for calculating Adjusted EBITDA under the bank credit agreement of Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (BCA), which is used in computing our ability to borrow under the BCA.The following tables provide reconciliations between Adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income. The following tables also provide additional reconciliations for purposes of calculating first lien indebtedness ratio covenant compliance under the BCA.\n\n[![](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/_pdf.gif)](https://d2ghdaxqb194v2.cloudfront.net/2732/195366.pdf) [Current Non-GAAP Reconciliations](https://d2ghdaxqb194v2.cloudfront.net/2732/195366.pdf)\n\n[![](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonRedClose.jpg)](Javascript:ClosePageDiv\\(\\)) [![](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonMinimize.jpg)](javascript:ResetApiSize\\(\\);) [![](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonMaximize.jpg)](javascript:ResizeApiViewer\\(\\);)\n\n### **Sinclair Television Group, Inc.
