Cutoff for inclusion of a dividend in the ETF’s distribution is 2\nbusiness days prior to the funds ex-dividend date.\nETFs with Return Of Capital (ROC) adjustments:\nSince equity REITs don’t report their tax information until after year end, please be advised certain iShares funds\nholding REIT securities apply an estimated return of capital (ROC) percentage to withhold dividend income throughout\nthe fund’s fiscal year. This is being done in an effort to avoid an overdistribution that would result in a return of capital\nto fund shareholders due to ROC adjustments from the underlying REIT holdings.\niShares Funds with 25% ROC adjustment: IYR*, REM*, REZ*, USRT*, & WOOD*\niShares Funds with 20% ROC adjustment: ERET, ICF, & REET\niShares Funds with 15% ROC adjustment: IJS*, IWC*, IWM*, & IWN*\niShares Funds with 10% ROC adjustment: IJH, IJJ*, IJK, IJR, IJT*, IMCB, ISCB, ISCG, ISCV, IWR*, IWS, IYF, & XJH\nAs of 7/31/2024, subject to change. *Note that ETFs with an asterisk will be changing to these ROC adjustments in their December 2024 distributions. IYR, REM, REZ, & USRT will\nbe changing from current 20% to 25% ROC adjustment. WOOD will move from 10% to 25% ROC adjustment. IJS, IWC, IWM, & IWN will move from current 10% to 15% ROC\nadjustment. IJJ, IJT, & IWR currently have no ROC adjustment and will be moving to a 10% ROC adjustment.\nA note on option-based ETFs:\nNote that certain ETFs that use options-based strategies have a higher risk of making distributions in excess of a fund’s\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits. These distributions may be characterized as a tax-free return of capital\nto the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the fund and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds\nshares of the Fund as capital assets).

Our 2024 Fall Investment Directions aims to provide investors with a roadmap for the remainder of the year.\n\nHere are three key takeaways:\n\nFirst, we believe the start of the Fed’s easing cycle is the time to consider moving out of cash and taking advantage of higher rates before they meaningfully drop.\n\nSecond, we think this is a moment for equity investors to position for a broadening out as tech earnings slow and other sectors accelerate. Quality may still be key however.\n\nThird, we believe the belly of the yield curve currently represents the most compelling option as a source of both income and diversification — especially if growth softens from here.\n\nIndeed, the U.S. economy has been resilient but shows signs of slowing since we published our Midyear Investment Directions in June. \n\nReflecting the cooling economy — and inflation approaching its 2% target — the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points in September.\n\nWe expect additional rate cuts this year, but in our view of the market, it is pricing in more easing than the Fed will actually deliver.\n\nThis divergence as well as uncertainty stemming from the U.S. election, could drive volatility. Add to that, September and October are historically tough months for stocks, a seasonal pattern that is only exaggerated in election years.\n\nFor investors looking to reduce volatility in their portfolios, we see opportunity in the tactical use of buffered strategies and minimum volatility funds. But, we also believe that near-term pull back represent an opportunity to allocate to high quality companies trading at reasonable valuations. We think investors should consider reallocating from mega cap to large cap, not from large cap to small or mid. It also presents an opportunity to more evenly balance between growth and value styles.\n\nLastly, we’re looking at sectors with value tilts like financials and defensive tilts like utilities.\n\nStill, the next few months could be volatile and ETFs can be an effective tool to help mitigate volatility through diversification. While active management provides a way to quickly adjust exposures in an environment of greater uncertainty.\n\nThanks for watching and be sure to check out our full Fall 2024 Investment Directions on iShares.com.\n\n**Disclosures:**\n\nSource: Historical price and volatility analysis during September and October and during election years from BlackRock, Bloomberg, as of September 16, 2024.

Our base case calls for U.S. growth to gradually slow but remain positive.\n\n**The Fed cut rates by 0.50% at its September meeting, initiating a cutting cycle 14 months after the last hike.** We expect further rate cuts at the November and December meetings this year, but ultimately believe the market may be pricing in more rate cuts than will be delivered. The divergence of policy rates from expectations could have important near-term implications in fixed income and equity market performance.\n\n**Our main takeaway from the FOMC meeting was that the Fed will be proactive in their risk management approach and has room for further cuts if the data requires.** With inflation moving towards the Fed’s 2% target, the Committee’s focus going forward will be more evenly distributed between labor markets and inflation. As a result, the pace of policy rate easing will be determined as much by employment and growth data as it is by inflation.\n\n**We believe the cutting cycle is the time to move out of cash and take advantage of higher rates before they drop meaningfully.** Our analysis shows that fixed income markets have historically outperformed cash during rate cutting cycles (_**Figure 1**_). The Fed’s new focus on both sides of their dual mandate increases our conviction that intermediate duration fixed income can act as a diversifier to equities, if growth deteriorates from here.\n\n#### Figure 1: Fixed income has averaged higher returns than cash during interest rate cutting cycles\n\n![Bar chart depicting annualized fixed income and cash returns during Federal Reserve cutting cycles.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-fixed-income-cash-returns-during-rate-cut-cycles.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, Bloomberg.

The chart shows average fixed income returns outpacing cash.\n\n**Equity markets have also historically done well during cutting cycles, but performance has significantly lagged in rate cut cycles that end in recession.** 2 While a recession is not our base case, some of the metrics that the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating) uses to determine the health of the economy are already beginning to moderate. This risks volatility ahead as markets become more sensitive to economic data, as was seen over the summer. Furthermore, we anticipate higher [volatility tied to the U.S. election](/us/insights/investing-in-an-election-year-2%20%20).\n\n### Figure 2: Asset class performance following previous Fed cuts\n\n12m forward return (%)\n\nCaption:\n\nTable with economic data points during the first Fed cut dating back to 1974, including GDP, inflation, unemployment rate, and returns across fixed income and equities.\n\nFirst Fed cut| Real GDP growth| Inflation (core CPI YoY%)| Unemployment rate (%)| S&P 500| BBG Agg| Quality equities| Russell 2000  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nJul '74| –3.7%| 8.8%| 5.4%| 15.7  \nApr '80| –8.0%| 13.0%| 6.9%| 40.6| 13.0| 65.5  \nJun '81| –2.9%| 9.4%| 7.5%| –10.8| 14.9| –21.0  \nOct '84| 3.9%| 4.9%| 7.4%| 17.5| 22.0| 17.6| 8.9  \nJun '89| 3.1%| 4.5%| 5.3%| 17.8| 8.8| 21.2| –1.2  \nJul '95| 3.5%| 3.0%| 5.7%| 21.4| 2.6| 22.4| 20.2  \nJan '01| –1.3%| 2.6%| 4.2%| –12.4| 7.9| –11.6| 3.8  \nSep '07| 2.3%| 2.1%| 4.7%| –18.8| 5.4| –15.5| –9.1  \nJul '19| 3.5%| 2.2%| 3.7%| 11.9| 10.1| 18.0| –4.6  \nMar '20| –5.3%| 2.1%| 4.4%| 29.4| 0.5| 27.8| 50.5  \nSept '24| 3.0%| 3.2%| 4.2%  \n  \n**Source:** Bloomberg.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.**\n\n## FIXED INCOME\n\n**Timing and curve positioning are key in cutting cycles. We believe modestly extending duration to the belly of the curve early in the cutting cycle may be most rewarded.** And yet, positioning data shows that investors continue to allocate to money market funds (MMF), with YTD inflows reaching new records.3 While history tells us MMF outflows typically do not occur until later in the Fed’s easing campaign, that same lookback shows that unwinding cash positions in favor of longer-dated fixed income allocations have tended to outperform when done earlier in the cycle.4 Any back up in yields could represent an opportunity for investors to move out on the curve and reduce an overweight allocation to cash.\n\n#### Figure 3: Investors have poured into cash since the pandemic\n\n![Line chart of AUM in money market funds since 2007.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-aum-in-money-market-funds-since-2007.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, EPFR. As of September 15, 2024.\n\n**Chart description:** Line chart of AUM in money market funds since 2007. Shows an upward trend.\n\n**We believe fiscal policy can continue to weigh on the long end of the yield curve, regardless of the election outcome.** While the front end of the curve trades on monetary policy, the back end is more closely tethered to Treasury issuance, fiscal spending, and normalizing term premium — a slew of catalysts likely to keep longer rates more elevated as the curve continues to steepen. With government spending unlikely to slow regardless of the election’s outcome and U.S. debt already breaching new highs each month, there’s precedent for rapid rate fluctuations in the long end of the curve — an unfavorable risk-reward profile.\n\n**Our preferred duration is the 3-7 year ‘belly’ of the curve.** While the current level of yields has fallen over the past few weeks, the exposure remains attractive. Consider that the belly is currently yielding more than the long bond averaged in the last 10 years.5 We like locking up yields at the start of the Fed’s easing cycle and look for any backup in rates as a buying opportunity. Additionally, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index's (Agg) performance over the current Fed pause period has lagged the exposure’s historical average for previous pauses, and we think that underperformance likely hails from the factors impacting the long end of the curve — our preferred duration is the belly as those headwinds remain (_**Figure 4**_).\n\n#### Figure 4: Fixed income markets have underperformed historical pause period returns\n\n![Bar chart of average returns over the last five Federal Reserve pause periods and current pause period for S&P 500, quality equities, and the Bloomberg Agg.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-sp500-avg-returns-last-five-fed-reserve-pause-periods.png)\n\n**Source:** Bloomberg, BlackRock.

Index performance does not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Past performance does not guarantee future results.**\n\n**Chart description:** Bar chart of average returns over the last five Federal Reserve pause periods and current pause period for S&P 500, quality equities, and the Bloomberg Agg.\n\n**Stock-bond correlations are back in negative territory, adding to fixed income’s appeal.** This was most clear in performance during the first week of September: as the S&P 500 sank 4% on labor market fears, the Agg posted positive returns and broke the months-long positive relationship.6 Look to the fixed income market as both a potential source of diversification and income, but the fluctuating nature of that relationship also has us considering other diversifiers (see [Portfolio Considerations](#c1726903528342)).\n\n**Given strong corporate fundamentals, we look to high yield bonds and structured credit to potentially add income to portfolios.** Default rates remain below long-term averages but have ticked higher. High yield markets have been in negative net issuance and net leverage has come down across all ratings.7 Even as the Fed kicks off their easing campaign, we expect rates to remain in restrictive territory. Consequently, the importance of selectivity in high yield markets to screen for companies able to balance still-high rates amid slowing growth increases.\n\n## FEATURED iSHARES FUNDS\n\n## EQUITY\n\n**Our equity outlook acknowledges the likelihood of volatility in the coming months.** More than anything, markets dislike uncertainty, and election years often provide plenty. Our analysis underscores that relationship — equity volatility historically tracks higher in the 90 days preceding elections than the 90 days following them.8 September and October have historically been the most negative months for U.S. equity performance, a seasonal trend that is only exaggerated in election years. And U.S. equities sit near all-time highs, accompanied by relatively rich valuations — a demanding setup for a challenging period.9\n\n  * **For investors looking to manage volatility, we see opportunity for the tactical use of buffered strategies** (see [Election Spotlight](#c1726903528336)), which track the return of a broad market up to an approximate upside limit, while seeking to maximize the downside protection against potential price declines.\n\n\n\n**We also see opportunity in volatility.** We like using any near-term pullbacks to allocate to high quality companies across a range of styles and sectors trading at reasonable valuations. We expect that risk taking to be rewarded later in the year with greater clarity over the cutting cycle and resolution of election uncertainty providing additional tailwinds.\n\n**We maintain our preference for quality-style strategies, which have outperformed the market this year, but that spread has been accompanied by increasing concern over valuations.** 10 The richening in quality has been driven to a significant degree by the rising valuations of its technology-sector constituents. To date, technology’s higher multiple has been justified by its rapid earnings growth, but consensus estimates forecast the earnings growth rate to decelerate from here.\n\n**The yawning gap in earnings growth between technology and ‘the rest’ is set to narrow, an important catalyst to the broadening out trade that we expect to continue in 2025** (_**Figure 5**_). For this reason, we favor a sector-neutral approach to quality, seeking companies with quality attributes across sectors and industries rather than simply tilting more deeply towards technology. We would also supplement this core exposure to quality with selective allocations to industries and sectors that have not participated to the same degree in the market’s rally and have further room to run, while also looking to active strategies that adjust quickly amid a broader factor rotation.\n\n#### Figure 5: Earnings growth expected to improve for ‘the rest’\n\n![Earnings from the Magnificent 7 cohort, and the S&P 500 excluding the Mag 7.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-mag7-cohort-and-sp500-earnings.png)\n\n**Source:** BofA US Equity & Quant Strategy, Factset.

The bar chart shows Mag 7 YoY EPS growth for the Mag 7 far outpacing at the start of the year, but the gap shrinking by the end of 2025.\n\n**A steepening yield curve with falling short rates should benefit exposures with value-tilts like financials, and lower rates and earnings growth can continue to benefit utilities.**\n\n  * **In addition to improving fundamentals, utilities have come into focus as a second-order beneficiary of the AI build out.** So far this year, investment into data center construction has swelled — the dollar amount behind the buildout between January and July alone is nearly double the annual average amount over the last decade.11 We think we are still in the early stages of this build and expect the historic capex cycle to continue to grow from here. Utilities have netted standout inflows so far this year on optimism for data center buildouts (and the corresponding upped electricity demand).12 We remain constructive on the sector and think the rally can extend from here — higher demand, reasonable valuations, and lower rates are all likely to provide further tailwinds.\n\n\n\n#### Figure 6: Data center construction investment continues to climb\n\n![Line chart depicting investment into data center construction over the last decade.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-data-center-construction-over-last-decade.png)\n\n**Source:** United States Census Bureau.

As of September 18, 2024.\n\n**Chart description:** Line chart depicting investment into data center construction over the last decade, increasing most in the last couple of years.\n\n**Financials can benefit from a steeper curve and lower short rates through improved net interest margins.** We see opportunities to get more granular in the sector. We believe investment banks are particularly well-positioned, as lower financing rates should unlock the bottleneck in corporate actions like leverage buyouts and mergers. Broker-dealers may also be beneficiaries, as lower rates will support the already record pace of bond issuance, driving underwriting fees and volumes on trading desks.13 Finally, insurance companies screen especially well on quality and valuation (_**Figure 7**_).\n\n#### Figure 7: We remain constructive on high quality equities, but weigh rich valuations\n\n![Scatter plot consisting of Investment Strategy's quality score and the premium/discount relative to average P/E ratio across GICS industries.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-investment-score-relative-to-avg-pe-ratio-gics-industries.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, Bloomberg.

The far-right quadrant depicts exposures that are more expensive relative to their average, and higher quality relative to its historical average.\n\n**From a portfolio perspective, the large outperformance of growth over value, and tech over the rest, may leave investors more heavily overweight growth and tech than they intended.** Value currently represents its smallest weight in the S&P 500 in the last 25 years, and as such, rebalancing flows into the end of the year may provide a tailwind to value exposures.14 Investors who have been disappointed with value index returns over the last decade may be turning to proven value managers to get back to a more even value and growth split — the Morningstar Large Value ETF category has seen most H1 flows into active funds (59% vs. 41% index), a dramatic divergence from the growth ETF trend (93% of flows into index).15\n\n**Though July and early August saw elevated flows into small caps, we think this is a moment to consider reallocating from mega-cap to large-cap, rather than from large- to mid or small.** 16 Based on Fed forecasts for rates in their September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), rates will remain close to 3% for the next two years, while economic growth will slow from current levels. While high beta small caps can post sharp rallies on rapid shifting narratives, we do not believe that the earnings backdrop or rates at current levels can support sustained small cap performance.\n\n**[Active management](/us/strategies/active-etfs) may provide a way to nimbly adjust exposures in an environment of greater uncertainty, lower liquidity and more frequent episodes of volatility.** Aside from [election-related uncertainty](/us/insights/investing-in-an-election-year), the Fed's balance sheet has shrunk by over $1.8 trillion since beginning their runoff in 2022, reducing market liquidity and raising the prospect of more frequent severe spikes in volatility.17\n\n## FEATURED iSHARES FUNDS\n\n## ELECTION SPOTLIGHT\n\n**History tells us that while tight elections are usually associated with increased volatility, broad market performance is unaffected by which party wins the White House.** At the index level, staying invested has been more important than which party wins the presidency.

The chart shows investing regardless of the party far outpaced investing for only Democrats or Republicans.\n\nPresident Biden’s exit from the election cycle resulted in a tightening of polls, and key battleground states remain hotly contested.18 While the two candidates have different policy ambitions spanning regulation, taxes, and trade, trading the election theme has become more difficult as the odds have narrowed.\n\n**Rather than tailoring a basket of favored exposures dependent on the election outcome, we prefer looking to common ground — beneficiaries of infrastructure and nearshoring investments stand out as two key opportunities:**\n\n  * We think domestic infrastructure spending is likely to continue in 2025 and prefer investing in the theme rather than specific companies.\n  * We also look to domestic manufacturing and prefer tilting towards companies focused on U.S. and ‘friend-shored’ tech production and distribution, especially as markets grapple with tariffs and trade disruptions.\n\n\n\nAn additional bipartisan theme: neither candidate has exhibited an appetite for curbing the current U.S. budget deficit. Both tickets are either reluctant to cut fiscal spending or have proposed tax cuts leading to a decline in government revenues. From an investment lens, the long end of the yield curve is tantamount with U.S. debt and deficit spending. While governments often prefer to issue more long duration bonds when running a deficit, the U.S. has chosen instead to issue primarily short-term Treasuries, making navigating the fixed income markets more complex — and active management potentially more beneficial.\n\nTo read more about how investors could navigate market during election years, read our _Outline for the Election Playbook_ ([Part 1](/us/insights/investing-in-an-election-year) | [Part 2](/us/insights/investing-in-an-election-year-2)).\n\n## FEATURED iSHARES FUNDS\n\n## PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe next few months tee up a series of volatility (or at least, uncertainty) inducing events: questions about the magnitude and pace of domestic monetary policy adjustments, diverging policy abroad, expectations for a weaker Q3 reporting season, all capped with November’s election. We expect these catalysts to be drivers of sharp market reactions, and like looking beyond U.S. equities and bonds to help investors construct their portfolios.\n\n#### Figure 9: Volatility has tracked higher since the start of the year\n\n![Line chart of volatility \\(VIX Index\\) by the start of the year, including a trendline.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1727220533000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-vix-volatility-index-start-of-year.png)\n\n**Source:** Bloomberg. Volatility as represented by VIX Index, dotted line depicting trendline since December 31, 2023. As of September 15, 2024.\n\n**Chart description:** Line chart of volatility (VIX Index) by the start of the year, including a trendline.\n\n### Think globally\n\n  * **For investors aiming to dial down U.S. beta, we like adding to international allocations.** Equities abroad offer added diversification, especially given the relatively low tech sector concentration and inherent value tilt in developed ex-U.S. markets. International quality opportunities also trade at a discount — relative to both its own historical averages, and U.S. quality equities, while maintaining less exposure to global trade.19\n  * **In emerging markets, we are constructive on single country exposures rather than broad allocations as regions contend with distinct inflation, growth, and policy backdrops.** We’ve seen a divergence in EM policy decisions, with Brazil hiking rates while Indonesia’s central bank eased on the same day. Chile, for example, is likely to continue benefitting from its exposure to the copper industry (as evident in August’s strong mining exports) and its dovish central bank guidance — we maintain our overweight. For investors who do want broad allocations, we lean into emerging market ex-China exposures, as the country teeters towards deflation and manufacturing continues to contract.20\n\n\n\n### Think beyond stocks and bonds\n\n  * **While equity markets continue to flirt with new all-time highs, the risk-on rally comes at the same time as the price of gold — typically seen as a haven in periods of economic downturns — also cleared new levels.** 21 Gold’s advance likely hails from a handful of catalysts such as strong central bank buying and increased demand for hedges against escalating tensions in the Middle East. Both pull the price of gold higher all while further Fed cuts on the docket up the non-yielding asset’s attractiveness, especially as the 50 basis point cut in September is likely to steer significant capital from developed nations into the gold market. Notably, the price rally has been met with a dearth of flows into gold ETPs, and we think that trajectory can reverse as record central bank buying is unlikely to slow, and further price upside is paired with portfolio diversification benefits.22\n\n\n\n### Keep taxes top of mind\n\n  * **Near-term pullbacks also represent an opportunity for investors to[harvest losses](/us/education/etfs-and-taxes#tax-loss-harvesting) and redeploy into high conviction pockets of the market.** August delivered a dose of volatility, and while the downturn proved to be short-lived, investors can sell exposures at a loss in future retreats and invest the proceeds in a correlated instrument — thereby locking in losses to offset a future capital gain, all while maintaining market exposure.\n\n\n\n## FEATURED iSHARES FUNDS\n\n![Photo: Gargi Pal Chaudhuri](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1695777579000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/headshots/ish-bio-photo-gargi-pal-chaudhuri-bw.jpg)\n\nGargi Pal Chaudhuri\n\nChief Investment and Portfolio Strategist Americas at BlackRock \n\n[ READ BIO  ](/us/biographies/gargi-pal-chaudhuri)\n\n![Photo: Kristy Akullian, CFA](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1697161811000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/headshots/ish-photo-bio-kristy-akullian-bw-200x200.jpg)\n\nKristy Akullian, CFA\n\nHead of iShares Investment Strategy \n\n[ READ BIO  ](/us/biographies/kristy-akullian)\n\nDavid Jones\n\nInvestment Strategist \n\nContributor\n\nFaye Witherall\n\nInvestment Strategist \n\nContributor\n\nJon Angel\n\nInvestment Strategist \n\nContributor\n\nDavid Hernandez\n\nInvestment Strategist \n\nContributor\n\nAnnie Khanna\n\nInvestment Strategist \n\nContributor\n\n#####  Related Topics \n\n[ Equity ](/us/taxonomy?tag=Equity)\n\n[ Fixed Income ](/us/taxonomy?tag=Fixed+Income)\n\n### Explore more\n\nOur Funds \n\nFIND A FUND\n\n  * [View all funds](/us/products/etf-investments)\n  * [Explore by goals](/us/products/investment-goals)\n  * [Compare ETFs](/us/products/compare-funds)\n  * [Discover by holdings](/us/products/investment-ideas)\n\n\n\nASSET CLASS\n\n  * [Equity](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&fac=43535|43580|43581|43584|43585|43615)\n  * [Fixed Income](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&dataView=fixedIncomeView&fac=43549|43563|43566|43567|43573|43588|43590|43774|43775|60556)\n  * [Commodities](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&fac=43587|43608)\n  * [Real Estate](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&fac=43776|61382)\n  * [Multi-Asset](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&fac=43589|43619|43625|61455)\n\n\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * [Core](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&ptrg=4|10|6|2|8)\n  * [Build](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&ptrg=214)\n  * [Treasuries](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&dataView=keyFacts&ptrg=28)\n  * [NEW: Digital Assets Collection](/us/products/digital-assets)\n  * [AI & Tech](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&ptrg=202)\n  * [Dividends](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&ptrg=90)\n  * [All-in-One ETFs](/us/products/etf-investments#/?productView=etf&fac=43589|43619|43625|61455)\n\n\n\n  * [ ADVISORS: FIND CORRELATED FUNDS  ](https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/tools/correlate-funds)\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Strategies \n\nEXPLORE NOW\n\n  * [ OUR STRATEGIES ](/us/strategies)\n\n\n\nGET STARTED\n\n  * [Investing with ETFs](/us/strategies/core-etfs)\n  * [Invest with bond ETFs](/us/strategies/invest-with-bond-etfs)\n  * [Income investing](/us/strategies/find-income-with-ishares)\n  * [Explore top stocks ETF](/us/strategies/top-20)\n\n\n\nGO FURTHER\n\n  * [Invest in Bitcoin](/us/strategies/ways-to-invest-in-bitcoin)\n  * [Access Ethereum](/us/strategies/ways-to-invest-in-ethereum)\n  * [Seek to outperform with active ETFs](/us/strategies/active-etfs)\n  * [Navigate turbulent markets](/us/strategies/navigate-turbulent-markets)\n  * [Invest in future trends](/us/strategies/thematic-investing)\n\n\n\n  * [ ADVISORS: REDESIGN PORTFOLIOS  ](https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/investment-strategies/preparing-portfolios)\n\n\n\n\nMarket Insights \n\nEXPLORE NOW\n\n  * [ OUTLOOK & INSIGHTS ](/us/insights)\n\n\n\nMARKET INSIGHTS\n\n  * [2025 Thematic Outlook](/us/insights/2025-thematic-outlook)\n  * [2024 Fall Investment Directions](/us/insights/investment-directions-fall-2024)\n  * [Bitcoin ETPs -

This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the[iShares Fund](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents#etfs) and [BlackRock Fund](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents#mutualfunds) prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.**\n\n**This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current[prospectus](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents#etfs \"prospectus\"). Investors should read it carefully before investing.**\n\n**Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.**\n\nThe iShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds or ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Investments in these products are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.\n\nThe price of gold and precious-metal related securities historically has been very volatile and may adversely affect the financial condition of those companies. The production and sale of precious metals can be affected by economic, financial and political factors, which may be unpredictable and significantly impact supply and prices.\n\nInternational investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.\n\nFunds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.\n\nThere can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced or risk will be reduced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics (\"factors\"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.\n\nActively managed funds do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index, may have higher portfolio turnover, and may charge higher fees than index funds due to increased trading and research expenses.\n\nFixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in the value of debt securities. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the debt issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.\n\nNon-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities.\n\nThere may be less information on the financial condition of municipal issuers than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Some investors may be subject to federal or state income taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable.\n\nAsset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, call, extension, valuation and liquidity risk and are subject to the risk of default on the underlying asset or mortgage, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Small movements in interest rates may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain ABS.\n\nMortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\") are subject to prepayment and extension risk and therefore react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSecurities with floating or variable interest rates may decline in value if their coupon rates do not keep pace with comparable market interest rates. The Fund’s income may decline when interest rates fall because most of the debt instruments held by the Fund will have floating or variable rates.\n\nCollateralized Debt Obligations (\"CDOs\") carry additional risks including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the risk that the collateral may default or decline in value or be downgraded, if rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; (iii) the Fund may invest in tranches of CDOs that are subordinate to other tranches; (iv) the lack of a readily available secondary market for CDOs.\n\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions.\n\nA fund's use of derivatives may reduce a fund's returns and/or increase volatility and subject the fund to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A fund could suffer losses related to its derivative positions because of a possible lack of liquidity in the secondary market and as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. There can be no assurance that any fund's hedging transactions will be effective.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the classification system used to determine the Factor Rotation model for the U.S. Equity Factor Rotation ETF will achieve its intended results. The fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities which may result in higher transaction costs to the fund. The fund is actively managed and does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.\n\nThe iShares Minimum Volatility Funds may experience more than minimum volatility as there is no guarantee that the underlying index's strategy of seeking to lower volatility will be successful.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that the Buffered Funds will be successful in their strategy to provide downside protection against Underlying ETF losses. The Funds do not provide principal protection or non-principal protection, and, despite the Approximate Buffer (the “Buffer”), an investor may experience significant losses on their investment, including the loss of their entire investment. In the event an investor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to the end of the Hedge Period, the returns realized by the investor will not match those that the Funds seeks to provide. In periods of extreme market volatility, the Funds' return may be subject to downside protection significantly lower than the Buffer and an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap (the \"Cap\"). A new Cap is established during each Rebalance Period and is dependent upon current market conditions. As such, the Cap is likely to change, sometimes significantly, from one Hedge Period to the next.\n\nThe Buffered Funds invest in FLEX Options that derive their value from the Underlying ETF. FLEX Options are subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation, and may be less liquid than other securities. The value of FLEX Options may be affected by interest rate changes, dividends, actual and implied volatility levels of the Underlying ETF’s share price, and the remaining time until the FLEX Options expire. Because of these factors, the Buffered Funds’ NAV may not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying ETF’s share price.\n\nTechnology companies may be subject to severe competition and product obsolescence.\n\nThis material represents an assessment of the market environment as of the date indicated; is subject to change; and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results.

Economic data continued to surprise to the upside across consumer, labor, and housing prints, all while Q3 earnings kicked off with resilient reports. Here’s what that meant for the top ETF flows of the month:\n\n## ADDING TO ACTIVE\n\nOctober saw a sharp increase in yields and a dramatic bond selloff, with 10-year Treasury yields climbing 55bps since the September Federal Reserve meeting.1 The increase follows stronger-than-expected data pulling 3Q GDP to a robust 2.8%, above the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast at the start of the month.2\n\nFixed income ETF investors turned to active solutions to navigate the rapidly evolving rate backdrop. October marked the largest month of inflows ever into the exposure, with **active fixed income ETFs adding $4.1bn, nearly double the YTD monthly average.** 3[](#_ftnref1)\n\n#### Figure 1: Monthly active fixed income ETF flows\n\n![Bar chart depicting monthly active fixed income flows from January to October.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1730477908000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-etf-flows-oct-2024-monthly-active-fixed-income.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, Markit.

Consumer discretionary ETFs saw dramatic inflows, adding their biggest weekly flow in three years, following Tesla’s 3Q earnings results. **Notably, the two sessions after Tesla’s report saw more inflows than all third-quarter flows combined.**\n\nPositioning reflects recent price action — in the last two weeks of the month, tech gave up earlier gains to sink into negative territory while consumer discretionary led to the upside. The real estate sector also outperformed the S&P 500, and flows followed, with real estate funds having clocked net inflows every week since the end of May.\n\n#### Figure 2: Investors add to consumer discretionary ETFs\n\n![Line chart showcasing cumulative weekly flows from consumer discretionary ETFs from January to October.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1730477908000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-etf-flows-oct-2024-consumer-discretionary-etfs.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, Markit.

While the supportive policies boosted short-term performance, the lack of meaningful follow through by the government led to Chinese equities losing ~4% in October.5 Flows in Chinese single-country ETFs have followed performance and shed $10bn from October 12th to 26th, a fourth of the inflows that followed the initial surprise policy shift.\n\nOutflows from China focused-ETFs intensified the broad outflows from single-country allocations, which were occurring for the first time this year. From mid-April to the start of October, single country funds notched $134bn in inflows.6 Over the past two weeks, however, China outflows have contributed to $16bn in outflows from single country allocations.7\n\n#### Figure 3: China outflows spook\n\n![Line chart comparing China ETF flows and single country ETF flows from January to October.](/blk-one02-c-assets/cache-1730477908000/images/media-bin/web/ishares/us/charts/ish-chart-etf-flows-oct-2024-china-and-single-country.png)\n\n**Source:** BlackRock, Bloomberg.
