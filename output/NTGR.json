(NASDAQ: NTGR), a global networking company that delivers innovative networking and Internet connected products to consumers and businesses, today reported preliminary financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\n  * First quarter 2024 net revenue of $164.6 million, a decrease of 9.0% from the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * First quarter 2024 GAAP operating loss of $21.6 million, or (13.2)% of net revenue, as compared to operating loss of $12.0 million, or (6.6)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * First quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating loss of $16.0 million, or (9.7)% of net revenue, as compared to non-GAAP operating loss of $7.1 million, or (3.9)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * First quarter 2024 GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.63, as compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.33 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * First quarter 2024 non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.28, as compared to non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.19 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis. \n\nCJ Prober, Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, “I am pleased that we were able to deliver revenue within our guidance range in the first quarter. However, the challenging macroeconomic environment coupled with continued high inflation and interest rates are pressuring our channel partners to drive inventory to historical lows across both our consumer and B2B businesses. While we have been working to bring down channel inventories, this higher level of destocking, combined with a mix shift from our premium consumer products to our service provider products and a slightly more promotional retail market, unfavorably impacted our profitability in the first quarter.” \n\n“As we saw channel destocking come in higher than expected in Q1, we developed a plan to expedite the remaining destocking in Q2. While this creates a near-term challenge in terms of expected financial results for Q2, it is the right action for the long-term health of the business and clears the way for a stronger second half of the year. Going forward, we will work to closely align sell through with our revenue, which will allow us to become a more predictable and profitable company in subsequent quarters. We will also more aggressively lower our own inventory through the rest of the year to reduce our working capital and generate cash.” \n\nMr. Prober continued, “After my first 90 days as CEO of NETGEAR, which included an expansive global tour meeting dozens of customers, partners and NETGEAR teams, I am sincerely excited about our growth opportunities and plans for returning to profitability. We remain fully committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders and these decisive near-term strategy adjustments enable this. We expect to emerge from Q2 with a solid foundation as we formalize our long-term strategy and capital allocation priorities throughout the rest of 2024.” \n\nBryan Murray, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, “We continued to make progress in reducing our own inventory levels, which were down $37.6 million in the first quarter, and we continue to drive towards our desired level of three months of supply. Our cash and short-term investments increased $5.8 million sequentially and we generated 88.4% greater cash from operations compared to the first quarter of 2023 while also repurchasing approximately 783,000 shares of NETGEAR common stock.” \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nMr. Murray continued, “We expect to accelerate our way through NFB and CHP destocking activities within the second quarter. We expect this effort to represent a headwind of between $25 million to $30 million to our Q2 topline, which is reflected in our guidance. We believe taking this immediate action, as compared to spreading it over multiple future quarters, will allow us to align our revenue with our sell through and ultimately manage a more efficient channel in future quarters. Revenue from the service provider channel is expected to be approximately $15 million in the second quarter as our partners await our next generation 5G mobile hotspots expected to launch in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect second quarter net revenue to be in the range of $125 million to $140 million. As we continue to make meaningful progress in reducing our own inventory levels, we will be consuming higher cost inventory. We expect we will be back to our historically normal inventory costs after we reach our target inventory levels of three months. We are also taking more aggressive action to consume some of our slower moving products in an accelerated fashion which will put pressure on our Q2 margins. Accordingly, we expect our second quarter GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (30.9)% to (27.9)%, and non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (25.0)% to (22.0)%. Our GAAP tax expense is expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $2.0 million, and our non-GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $7.0 million to $8.0 million for the second quarter of 2024.” \n\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table: \n\n**Three months ending**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**  \n**(In millions, except for percentage data)** |  Operating Margin  Rate  |  Tax Expense (Benefit)   \nGAAP  |  (30.9)% - (27.9)%  |  $1.0 - $2.0   \nEstimated adjustments for1:   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  4.0%  |  -   \nRestructuring and other charges  |  1.9%  |  -   \nNon-GAAP tax adjustments  |  -  |  $(9.0)   \nNon-GAAP  |  (25.0)% - (22.0)%  |  $ (8.0) - $ (7.0)   \n1 Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; restructuring and other charges and discrete tax benefits or detriments that cannot be forecasted (e.g., windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards or items related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions). New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.   \n  \n**Investor Conference Call / Webcast Details**\n\nNETGEAR will review the first quarter results and discuss management's expectations for the second quarter of 2024 today, Wednesday, May 1, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT).

Risk Factors\" in NETGEAR’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2024. Given these circumstances, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. NETGEAR undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law._\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Information:_ **\n\n_To supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP other operating expenses, net, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP other income (expenses), net, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain/loss on investments, net, and adjust for effects related to non-GAAP tax adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance._\n\n_In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:_\n\n  * _the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results;_\n  * _the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses;_\n  * _a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and_\n  * _an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n\n\n_The following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:_\n\n_Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors._\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results._\n\n_Other items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, and gain/loss on investments, net. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred._\n\n_Non-GAAP tax adjustments consist of adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income (loss). We believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding both current period performance and the on-going performance of our business. Non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) is computed on a current and deferred basis with non-GAAP income (loss) consistent with use of non-GAAP income (loss) as a performance measure. The Non-GAAP tax provision (benefit) is calculated by adjusting the GAAP tax provision (benefit) for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, with specific tax provisions such as state income tax and Base-erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax recomputed on a non-GAAP basis, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The tax valuation allowance is a non-cash adjustment primarily reflecting our expectations of, and assumptions as to, future operating results and applicable tax laws, that are not directly attributable to the current quarter’s operating performance. For interim periods, the non-GAAP income tax provision (benefit) is calculated based on the forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for interim discrete items._\n\nSource: NETGEAR-F \n\n**-Financial Tables Attached-**\n\n**NETGEAR, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(In thousands)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**March 31, 2024** |

(NASDAQ: NTGR), a global networking company that delivers innovative products to global consumers and businesses, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. As expected, second quarter results reflect the impact of destocking approximately $30 million of channel inventory, and the costs associated with an aggressive reduction of legacy inventory. \n\n  * Second quarter 2024 net revenue of $143.9 million, a decrease of 17.0% from the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Second quarter 2024 GAAP operating loss of $46.9 million, or (32.6)% of net revenue, as compared to operating loss of $17.8 million, or (10.3)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Second quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating loss of $31.1 million, or (21.6)% of net revenue, as compared to non-GAAP operating loss of $10.7 million, or (6.2)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Second quarter 2024 GAAP net loss per diluted share of $1.56, as compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.29 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Second quarter 2024 non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.74, as compared to non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.16 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended at $294.3 million, up $4.9 million from the previous quarter and net of stock repurchases in the second quarter of $10.0 million. \n\n\n\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis. \n\nCJ Prober, Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, “Last quarter we outlined a plan for transforming NETGEAR with a focus on creating long term value for shareholders. I’m very happy to report that our team demonstrated stellar execution in the second quarter and delivered on our goals, including the achievement of an accelerated destocking plan of approximately $30 million and a significant decrease in our finished goods inventory. With revenue and non-GAAP operating margin above the high end of our guidance, a fourth consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation and our strategic internal reorganization completed, we have positioned NETGEAR well for long term success.” \n\n“In our NFB business, we delivered a record quarter of end market sales for our ProAV managed switch products and the sell-through for this business grew in each of our three global regions. This progress is enabled by our broadening base of manufacturing partners and early momentum in our expansion into the broadcast vertical. Although we remain challenged in the traditional IT and WIFI Lan markets, the long-term potential of NFB is very exciting and we have [hired a seasoned leader](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.netgear.com%2Freleases%2Fpress-release-details%2F2024%2FNETGEAR-Announces-New-Additions-to-its-Board-of-Directors-and-Management-Team-to-Fuel-Growth-Across-Company-Sectors%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54102244&newsitemid=20240731011307&lan=en-US&anchor=hired+a+seasoned+leader&index=1&md5=a92d6379baa3a6bca50bad2ade7af082) to help us unlock profitable growth for this business. Pramod Badjate has joined us as the President and GM of NFB. Pramod is a networking veteran with a strong track record at Cisco, Ruckus and, most recently, Arista. Pramod and I have a shared belief that we can unlock significant value from our B2B segment and the opportunity ahead is why we are able to attract such an accomplished leader for NFB.” \n\n“In our CHP business, we continue to drive growth in our premium products while executing on the strategy of delivering industry leading products for the broader market. Our recently launched, lower priced WIFI 7 products and cable modems are outperforming our expectations, and we are beginning to see signs of recovery in the US consumer networking market. Our subscription business continues to grow and we exited the quarter with over 958,000 subscribers, of which 544,000 were recurring subscribers that drove 30% growth in our recurring subscriber revenue year over year. Innovation remains a key imperative and we have a slate of products across a range of price points planned for release over the next 12 months, which we anticipate will further expand our market presence and broaden our subscription funnel to drive continued recurring revenue growth.” \n\nMr. Prober continued, “Finally, I’m [delighted to welcome Laura Orvidas](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.netgear.com%2Freleases%2Fpress-release-details%2F2024%2FNETGEAR-Announces-New-Additions-to-its-Board-of-Directors-and-Management-Team-to-Fuel-Growth-Across-Company-Sectors%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54102244&newsitemid=20240731011307&lan=en-US&anchor=delighted+to+welcome+Laura+Orvidas&index=2&md5=44622f6d68683182e068df9ec3ab660f) to the team as our newest board member, along with Pramod and the many new leaders who have recently joined NETGEAR as part of our internal reorganization. The wealth of industry expertise and operational acumen this team collectively possesses will be invaluable as we bring NETGEAR into its next phase of growth, return to profitability and deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders.” \n\nBryan Murray, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, “We continued to make progress in reducing our inventory, which declined by $22.3 million sequentially and drove a fourth consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation. Converting our working capital into cash remains a key focus, with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increasing by $4.9 million sequentially. We repurchased approximately 799,800 shares of NETGEAR common stock and in addition, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an incremental 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, bringing our repurchase program total to 3,875,000 shares, or approximately $62 million based on this week’s opening share price. We plan to continue to be opportunistic on repurchases.” \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nMr. Murray continued, “We have completed our destocking actions for both the NFB and CHP businesses in the second quarter and expect to see more predictable performance that is aligned to the market. However, while we anticipate less volatility from shifting channel inventory levels, participating more significantly in the broader CHP market and growing our NFB business momentum will take time to execute fully. We anticipate revenue from the service provider channel to be approximately $15 million in the third quarter as our partners prepare to launch our next generation 5G mobile hotspots early in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect third quarter net revenue to be in the range of $160 million to $175 million, up 16% sequentially at the midpoint. We expect gross margins and operating margins to continue to be impacted by our inventory reduction efforts and higher than expected transportation costs due to a variety of factors, including the Red Sea shipping crisis. Accordingly, we expect our third quarter GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (15.3)% to (12.3)%, and non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (11.0)% to (8.0)%. Our GAAP tax expense is expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $2.0 million, and our non-GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024.” \n\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table: \n\n**Three months ending**  \n---  \n**September 29, 2024**  \n**(In millions, except for percentage data)** |  Operating Margin Rate  |  Tax Expense (Benefit)   \nGAAP  |  (15.3)% - (12.3)%  |  $1.0 - $2.0   \nEstimated adjustments for 1 :   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  3.4%  |  -   \nRestructuring and other charges  |  0.9%  |  -   \nNon-GAAP tax adjustments  |  -  |  $(3.5)   \nNon-GAAP  |  (11.0)% - (8.0)%  |  $(2.5) - $(1.5)   \n  \n1  Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; restructuring and other charges and discrete tax benefits or detriments that cannot be forecasted (e.g., windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards or items related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions). New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. \n\n**Investor Conference Call / Webcast Details**\n\nNETGEAR will review the second quarter results and discuss management's expectations for the third quarter of 2024 today, Wednesday, July 31, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT).

NETGEAR undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law._\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Information:_ **\n\n_To supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP other operating expenses, net, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP other income (expenses), net, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain/loss on investments, net, gain on litigation settlements, and adjust for effects related to non-GAAP tax adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance._\n\n_In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:_\n\n  * _the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results;_\n  * _the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses;_\n  * _a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and_\n  * _an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n\n\n_The following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:_\n\n_Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors._\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results._\n\n_Other items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, and gain/loss on investments, net. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred._\n\n_Non-GAAP tax adjustments consist of adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income (loss). We believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding both current period performance and the on-going performance of our business. Non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) is computed on a current and deferred basis with non-GAAP income (loss) consistent with use of non-GAAP income (loss) as a performance measure. The Non-GAAP tax provision (benefit) is calculated by adjusting the GAAP tax provision (benefit) for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, with specific tax provisions such as state income tax and Base-erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax recomputed on a non-GAAP basis, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The tax valuation allowance is a non-cash adjustment primarily reflecting our expectations of, and assumptions as to, future operating results and applicable tax laws, that are not directly attributable to the current quarter’s operating performance. For interim periods, the non-GAAP income tax provision (benefit) is calculated based on the forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for interim discrete items._\n\nSource: NETGEAR-F \n\n**-Financial Tables Attached-**\n\n**NETGEAR, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(In thousands)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024** |

(NASDAQ: NTGR), a global leader in intelligent networking solutions for businesses, homes, and service providers, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024. \n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net revenue of $182.9 million, a decrease of 7.6% from the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP operating income of $95.8 million, or 52.4% of net revenue, as compared to operating loss of $0.6 million, or (0.3)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 million, or 0.9% of net revenue, as compared to non-GAAP operating income of $5.3 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.90, as compared to net loss per diluted share of $2.87 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.17, as compared to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.23 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended at $395.7 million, up $101.4 million from the previous quarter. \n\n\n\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis. \n\nCJ Prober, Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, \"Today marks my nine-month anniversary with NETGEAR, and I am thrilled with our progress and the speed at which we are executing on our transformation. Q3 was an excellent quarter where we exceeded revenue and operating income guidance, achieved profitability, and increased our cash balance by over $100 million.” \n\nMr. Prober continued, “Our ProAV business had another record quarter in end user sales, and we added over 30 new manufacturing partners to strengthen our differentiation and software leadership in this category. We also launched several innovative products, including the M7 Pro, the industry’s first mobile hotspot that combines 5G and WIFI 7. With great executives joining the team and already driving positive early results, we are confident that we are positioning NETGEAR to fully capitalize on numerous market opportunities to generate long-term growth and profitability and we remain focused on creating long-term value for shareholders.” \n\nBryan Murray, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, “We continued to execute on our plan to reduce our inventory, which declined by $27.0 million sequentially and represents less than 4 months of inventory, including finished goods and components, for the first time in over 3 years. Gross margin for the quarter exceeded 30% and NFB topline grew over 10% year over year and returned to historical levels on contribution margin. In Q3 we also delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation, even after removing the effect of the TP-Link settlement, and we exited the quarter with $395.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, a $101.4 million sequential increase. In addition, we repurchased approximately $1.5 million of NETGEAR common stock before being restricted from further repurchases in the quarter due to trading restrictions associated with our TP-Link settlement negotiations. We expect to resume our share repurchase program in Q4 as we continue to believe that share repurchases are an important part of our capital allocation plan.” \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nMr. Murray continued, “As we experienced in the third quarter, we expect to continue to see more predictable performance that is aligned with the market for both of our businesses. Within NFB, we expect to experience continued growth led by our ProAV line of managed switches. While we are seeing the signs of market recovery in CHP, we expect increased promotional activity within our retail business due in part to the holiday period. As we were able to pull forward the launch of our M7 Pro mobile hotspot into the third quarter, we expect revenue from the service provider channel to be approximately $20 million in Q4, down slightly on a sequential basis. Accordingly, we expect fourth quarter net revenue to be in the range of $160 million to $175 million. We expect gross margins and operating margins to continue to be impacted by our inventory reduction efforts and higher than expected transportation costs due to a variety of factors, including the Red Sea shipping crisis. We also expect margins to be impacted from the increased promotional activities within our CHP retail business. Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (12.4)% to (9.4)%, and non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (8.0)% to (5.0)%. Our GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million, and our non-GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $0.0 million to $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.” \n\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table: \n\n**Three months ending**  \n---  \n**December 31, 2024**  \n**(In millions, except for percentage data)** |  Operating Margin Rate  |  Tax Expense (Benefit)   \nGAAP  |  (12.4)% - (9.4)%  |  $(3.0) - $(2.0)   \nEstimated adjustments for 1 :   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  3.9%  |  -   \nRestructuring and other charges  |  0.5%  |  -   \nNon-GAAP tax adjustments  |  -  |  $2.0   \nNon-GAAP  |  (8.0)% - (5.0)%  |  $(1.0) - $0   \n1 |  Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; restructuring and other charges and discrete tax benefits or detriments that cannot be forecasted (e.g., windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards or items related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions). New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Investor Conference Call / Webcast Details**\n\nNETGEAR will review the third quarter results and discuss management's expectations for the fourth quarter of 2024 today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT).

These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, intangibles impairment, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain/loss on investments, net, gain on litigation settlements, and adjust for effects related to non-GAAP tax adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance._\n\n_In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:_\n\n  * _the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results;_\n  * _the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses;_\n  * _a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and_\n  * _an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n\n\n_The following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:_\n\n_Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors._\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results._\n\n_Other items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, and gain/loss on investments, net. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred._\n\n_Non-GAAP tax adjustments consist of adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income (loss). We believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding both current period performance and the on-going performance of our business. Non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) is computed on a current and deferred basis with non-GAAP income (loss) consistent with use of non-GAAP income (loss) as a performance measure. The Non-GAAP tax provision (benefit) is calculated by adjusting the GAAP tax provision (benefit) for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, with specific tax provisions such as state income tax and Base-erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax recomputed on a non-GAAP basis, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The tax valuation allowance is a non-cash adjustment primarily reflecting our expectations of, and assumptions as to, future operating results and applicable tax laws, that are not directly attributable to the current quarter’s operating performance.

(NASDAQ: NTGR), the leading provider of networking products that power businesses of any size, today announced the launch of [Engage 2.0](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fengage&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=Engage+2.0&index=1&md5=532d848ce6f3eb3583b95c36450770d8), a major upgrade to the powerful platform designed to streamline management of audiovisual (AV) networks. NETGEAR Engage™ 2.0 is free and available to download starting today. \n\nThe convergence of AV and IT environments and return of large-scale and mobile events and experiences continue to change the way AV systems are used, and the impact is significant. AV over IP brings complexity to commercial, broadcast, or residential installers when it comes to managing Ethernet switches, routers, and WiFi access points. For example, detecting Ethernet switches and access points deployed across a network requires a great deal of manual effort. Additionally, updating firmware on multiple devices is time consuming, and proper configuration of AV networks can be cumbersome. Now that the network is the central AV fabric, an improper setup can ruin the entire AV experience. \n\nGiven these challenges, a powerful central management system is critical. The new NETGEAR Engage 2.0, a free software download, provides a centralized and user-friendly way to manage AV networks. By providing AV network, router, and WiFi controllability under one platform, users gain more seamless configuration and management for any installation. \n\n“With almost three decades of network leadership, we're constantly innovating to simplify AV and WiFi connectivity and provide a more seamless management experience,” said Laurent Masia, Senior Director of Product Line Management, Managed Switches, at NETGEAR. “The new Engage 2.0 software delivers expansive, unified control features for even the most complex AV network installations.” \n\nEngage 2.0 allows for effortless WiFi control in AV fixed installations with touch panels and tablets connecting to ad-hoc wireless networks, enhancing the control of AV endpoints across VLANs. For large events, the platform allows installers to create temporary WiFi guest networks to provide a robust WiFi solution for mobile studios or crews, ensuring guests stay connected. For residential settings, the enhanced capabilities streamline AV deployments allowing AV system integrators to manage both AV systems and home WiFi networks. \n\nAdditional Engage 2.0 WiFi features include: \n\n  * **Freedom for AV & Lighting Crews: ** Allows technicians to connect to the AV network wirelessly, freeing them from being tethered to the rack. This flexibility supports the integration of other AV and lighting control software that can now connect via WiFi to the wired network. \n  * **Unified Wired and Wireless Management:** Seamlessly integrates wired and wireless infrastructure, allowing NETGEAR AV switches, pro router, and WiFi access points to be configured together with Engage profiles. Key features include Auto-Trunk, Fast Roaming, and mDNS reflector/gateway across profiles. \n  * **LAN and WLAN under Control:** Engage 2.0 firmware introduces advanced WiFi management for NETGEAR AV installations, supporting WiFi assignment to Profiles/VLANs, Auto-Trunk, and Instant Mesh for simplified setup. \n  * **Auto Discovery and Onboarding Capabilities:** Automatically detects all NETGEAR AV [M4250](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwired%2Fswitches%2Ffully-managed%2Fm4250%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=M4250&index=2&md5=affd0d093182cf7a16a0ab0feb5dae43), [M4300](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwired%2Fswitches%2Ffully-managed%2Fm4300&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=M4300&index=3&md5=6c4274a1b57e952347e36412f88346fa), [M4350](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwired%2Fswitches%2Ffully-managed%2Fm4350%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=M4350&index=4&md5=b2ac0b7aef59258f75f2cd40214383e8), and [M4500](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwired%2Fswitches%2Ffully-managed%2Fm4500&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=M4500&index=5&md5=884f9d1cb6288f6c8fe5989f8915828a) series switches and supports one [PR460X Pro Router](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwired%2Frouters%2Fpr460x%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=PR460X+Pro+Router&index=6&md5=520f59e88dc16970b94b5e935cab1e4a) and up to 10 [WBE758](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwifi%2Faccess-points%2Fwbe758%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=WBE758&index=7&md5=afebcb5fac11b5d697ef8763d3484391) / [WBE718](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2Fwifi%2Faccess-points%2Fwbe718%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=WBE718&index=8&md5=8aa85694b99ccd70ae2033e0a290d3eb) WiFi 7 access points per site. \n  * **Zero Configuration Setup:** Auto-trunking on switches where the access points are connected ensures seamless integration and ease of use. \n  * **Fast Roaming and Auto-Mesh Support:** Utilizes protocols such as OKC, 802.11r, 802.11k, and 802.11v for optimal performance and connectivity. \n\n\n\nTo learn more, visit [https://www.netgear.com/business/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2F&esheet=54150738&newsitemid=20241112527672&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fbusiness%2F&index=9&md5=daf02a350f8e6a860e33fc7067e70e41). \n\n**About NETGEAR, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 1996 and headquartered in the USA, NETGEAR® (NASDAQ: NTGR) is a global leader in innovative networking technologies for businesses, homes, and service providers.

(NASDAQ: NTGR), a global leader in intelligent networking solutions for businesses, homes, and service providers, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024. \n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net revenue of $182.9 million, a decrease of 7.6% from the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP operating income of $95.8 million, or 52.4% of net revenue, as compared to operating loss of $0.6 million, or (0.3)% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 million, or 0.9% of net revenue, as compared to non-GAAP operating income of $5.3 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.90, as compared to net loss per diluted share of $2.87 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n    * Third quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.17, as compared to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.23 in the comparable prior-year quarter. \n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended at $395.7 million, up $101.4 million from the previous quarter. \n\n\n\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis. \n\nCJ Prober, Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, \"Today marks my nine-month anniversary with NETGEAR, and I am thrilled with our progress and the speed at which we are executing on our transformation. Q3 was an excellent quarter where we exceeded revenue and operating income guidance, achieved profitability, and increased our cash balance by over $100 million.” \n\nMr. Prober continued, “Our ProAV business had another record quarter in end user sales, and we added over 30 new manufacturing partners to strengthen our differentiation and software leadership in this category. We also launched several innovative products, including the M7 Pro, the industry’s first mobile hotspot that combines 5G and WIFI 7. With great executives joining the team and already driving positive early results, we are confident that we are positioning NETGEAR to fully capitalize on numerous market opportunities to generate long-term growth and profitability and we remain focused on creating long-term value for shareholders.” \n\nBryan Murray, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, “We continued to execute on our plan to reduce our inventory, which declined by $27.0 million sequentially and represents less than 4 months of inventory, including finished goods and components, for the first time in over 3 years. Gross margin for the quarter exceeded 30% and NFB topline grew over 10% year over year and returned to historical levels on contribution margin. In Q3 we also delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation, even after removing the effect of the TP-Link settlement, and we exited the quarter with $395.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, a $101.4 million sequential increase. In addition, we repurchased approximately $1.5 million of NETGEAR common stock before being restricted from further repurchases in the quarter due to trading restrictions associated with our TP-Link settlement negotiations. We expect to resume our share repurchase program in Q4 as we continue to believe that share repurchases are an important part of our capital allocation plan.” \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nMr. Murray continued, “As we experienced in the third quarter, we expect to continue to see more predictable performance that is aligned with the market for both of our businesses. Within NFB, we expect to experience continued growth led by our ProAV line of managed switches. While we are seeing the signs of market recovery in CHP, we expect increased promotional activity within our retail business due in part to the holiday period. As we were able to pull forward the launch of our M7 Pro mobile hotspot into the third quarter, we expect revenue from the service provider channel to be approximately $20 million in Q4, down slightly on a sequential basis. Accordingly, we expect fourth quarter net revenue to be in the range of $160 million to $175 million. We expect gross margins and operating margins to continue to be impacted by our inventory reduction efforts and higher than expected transportation costs due to a variety of factors, including the Red Sea shipping crisis. We also expect margins to be impacted from the increased promotional activities within our CHP retail business. Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (12.4)% to (9.4)%, and non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (8.0)% to (5.0)%. Our GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million, and our non-GAAP tax benefit is expected to be in the range of $0.0 million to $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.” \n\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table: \n\n**Three months ending**  \n---  \n**December 31, 2024**  \n**(In millions, except for percentage data)** |  Operating Margin Rate  |  Tax Expense (Benefit)   \nGAAP  |  (12.4)% - (9.4)%  |  $(3.0) - $(2.0)   \nEstimated adjustments for 1 :   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  3.9%  |  -   \nRestructuring and other charges  |  0.5%  |  -   \nNon-GAAP tax adjustments  |  -  |  $2.0   \nNon-GAAP  |  (8.0)% - (5.0)%  |  $(1.0) - $0   \n1 |  Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; restructuring and other charges and discrete tax benefits or detriments that cannot be forecasted (e.g., windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards or items related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions). New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Investor Conference Call / Webcast Details**\n\nNETGEAR will review the third quarter results and discuss management's expectations for the fourth quarter of 2024 today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT).

These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, intangibles impairment, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain/loss on investments, net, gain on litigation settlements, and adjust for effects related to non-GAAP tax adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance._\n\n_In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:_\n\n  * _the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results;_\n  * _the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses;_\n  * _a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and_\n  * _an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n\n\n_The following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:_\n\n_Amortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors._\n\n_Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results._\n\n_Other items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, and gain/loss on investments, net. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred._\n\n_Non-GAAP tax adjustments consist of adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income (loss). We believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding both current period performance and the on-going performance of our business. Non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) is computed on a current and deferred basis with non-GAAP income (loss) consistent with use of non-GAAP income (loss) as a performance measure. The Non-GAAP tax provision (benefit) is calculated by adjusting the GAAP tax provision (benefit) for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments, with specific tax provisions such as state income tax and Base-erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax recomputed on a non-GAAP basis, as well as adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The tax valuation allowance is a non-cash adjustment primarily reflecting our expectations of, and assumptions as to, future operating results and applicable tax laws, that are not directly attributable to the current quarter’s operating performance.

(Nasdaq: NTGR), the leader in advanced networking technologies for businesses, homes and service providers around the world, today announced that it granted equity awards on October 15, 2024 to newly-hired President and General Manager, NETGEAR for Business (NFB), Pramod Badjate as well as several newly-hired employees in multiple business units throughout the company. The awards were granted in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) as a material inducement to their commencing employment with NETGEAR. \n\nThe inducement awards consist of (1) an award of time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) relating to 165,000 shares of NETGEAR’s common stock to Mr. Badjate, (2) awards of time-based RSUs covering 208,258 shares of NETGEAR’s common stock to the additional referenced newly-hired employees (each, an “RSU Award”), and (3) an award of performance-based RSUs with a target amount of 55,000 shares of NETGEAR’s common stock to Mr. Badjate (the “PSU Award”). \n\nOne-third (1/3rd) of the total number of shares subject to Mr. Badjate’s RSU Award will vest on July 31, 2025, and one-twelfth (1/12th) of the total number of shares subject to his RSU Award will vest in equal quarterly installments thereafter, in each case subject to Mr. Badjate providing continued service with NETGEAR through the applicable vesting dates. \n\nThe number of shares subject to the PSU Award that become eligible to vest (“Vesting Eligible PSUs”) will be determined based on how NETGEAR’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) from April 27, 2024 through December 31, 2026 compares to the TSRs of the companies in the Nasdaq Telecommunications Index (IXTC). The Vesting Eligible PSUs, if any, will vest on July 31, 2027, subject to Mr. Badjate’s continued service with NETGEAR through that date. \n\n**About NETGEAR, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 1996 and headquartered in the USA, NETGEAR® (NASDAQ: NTGR) is a global leader in innovative networking technologies for businesses, homes, and service providers.
