(NASDAQ: DDI) (“ _DoubleDown_ ” or the “ _Company_ ”), a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, today announced unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 Summary:**\n\n  * Revenue increased to $83.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $73.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. SuprNation, a European iGaming operator (“ _SuprNation_ ”) which was acquired by the Company on October 31, 2023, generated total revenue of $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% to $75.2 million.\n\n\n  * Operating expenses increased to $47.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $43.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the third quarter 2024 inclusion of operating expenses related to SuprNation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses.\n\n\n  * Net income decreased to $25.1 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.11 ($0.51 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)), in the third quarter of 2024, from net income of $26.9 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.87 ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expense which included new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by higher revenue and lower overall sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased to $36.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43.5% in the third quarter of 2024 from 40.7% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (“ _ARPDAU_ ”) for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.30 in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.06 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $1.33 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Average monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $281 in the third quarter of 2024 from $245 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $288 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n“The third quarter marked another period of strong performance with consolidated revenue rising 14% to $83 million and Adjusted EBITDA increasing 22% to $36.1 million,” said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. “Our third quarter growth includes a 3% year-over-year increase in social casino revenue to $75.2 million, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The consistent top-line and cash generating performance of our core social casino business highlights our best-in-class ability to monetize our loyal players while maintaining strict discipline with our user acquisition and R&D spend which drives strong profitability and free cash flow. This core operating focus, which we also apply to our SuprNation iGaming business, has resulted in trailing twelve months cash flows from operations of approximately $101 million, including $31.8 million generated in the 2024 third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of more than $30 million.\n\n“Our SuprNation iGaming operations continue to generate higher quarterly revenue compared to the estimated level the business was achieving prior to our acquisition in October 2023. As we gain more experience with operating our first real money casino site, our focus for the business continues to emphasize go-to-market initiatives, including marketing and player-engagement strategies, that are consistent with our commitment to drive profitable revenue growth and positive cash flow contributions.\n\n“Our disciplined approach to user acquisition and R&D spend delivers exceptional quarterly Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow which continues to further solidify our strong balance sheet and financial position. We ended the third quarter with an aggregate net cash position of approximately $335 million, or approximately $6.76 per ADS. With our strong net cash position and consistent strong free cash flow generation we have significant financial flexibility to evaluate organic and M&A focused growth opportunities that can create new value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Summary Operating Results for DoubleDown Interactive (Unaudited)**\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRevenue ($ MM)| $| 83.0| $| 73.0| $| 259.4| $| 225.8  \nTotal operating expenses| 47.7| 43.3| 156.9| 143.2  \nNet income ($ MM)| $| 25.1| $| 29.7| $| 88.8| $| 82.8  \nAdjusted EBITDA ($ MM)| $| 36.1| $| 26.9| $| 105.0| $| 75.0  \nNet income margin| 30.3%| 36.9%| 34.2%| 33.2%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 43.5%| 40.7%| 40.5%| 36.7%  \nNon-financial performance metrics  \nAverage MAUs (000s)| 1,312| 1,675| 1,393| 1,837  \nAverage DAUs (000s)| 632| 749| 665| 794  \nARPDAU| $| 1.30| $| 1.06| $| 1.30| $| 1.05  \nAverage monthly revenue per payer| $| 281| $| 245| $| 283| $| 234  \nPayer conversion| 6.8%| 5.9%| 6.6%| 5.9%  \n(1) Social casino/free-to-play games only  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024, inclusive of the contributions from SuprNation, was $83.0 million, an increase of 14% from $73.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% year over year to $75.2 million, primarily reflecting higher engagement and monetization of the existing player base.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 10% year over year to $47.7 million. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of SuprNation expenses in the third quarter of 2024, which were not incurred in the third quarter of 2023 given that SuprNation was acquired in October 2023.\n\nNet income was $25.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, or $10.11 per fully diluted common share ($0.51 per ADS), as compared to net income of $26.9 million, or $10.87 per fully diluted common share ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by increased revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenditures. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 increased 22%, or $6.4 million, to $36.1 million, compared to $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the increase in net income, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects higher revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $31.8 million from $28.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher operating income.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (November 11, 2024) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results.

Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as “anticipates,” believes,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “objectives,” “intends,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plans,” potential,” “near-term,” long-term,” “projections,” “assumptions,” “projects,” “guidance,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “target,” “trends,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“Adjusted EBITDA”) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported GAAP “net income before provision for taxes” to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following six line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) interest income; (iii) interest expense; (iv) foreign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss; (v) short-term investments (gain) loss; and (vi) other (income) expense, net. The below table sets forth the full reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures:\n\n**Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures**| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n__(in millions, except percentages)__| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 25.1| $| 26.9| $| 88.8| $| 75.0  \nIncome tax benefit (expense)| 8.8| 7.8| 26.2| 22.1  \nIncome (loss) before tax| 33.9| 34.7| 114.9| 97.1  \nAdjustments for:  \nDepreciation and amortization| 0.8| 0.1| 2.5| 0.2  \nInterest income| (4.0| )| (3.1| )| (11.3| )| (10.5| )  \nInterest expense| 0.5| 0.4| 1.3| 1.3  \nForeign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss| 4.9| (2.3| )| (2.3| )| (5.4| )  \nShort-term investments (gain) loss| 7| -| 0.0| 0.1  \nOther (income) expense, net| (0.0| )| (0.1| )| (0.2| )| -  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 36.1| $| 29.7| $| 105.0| $| 82.8  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 43.5%| 40.7%| 40.5%| 36.7%  \n  \nWe encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n**Company Contact:** Joe Sigrist[ir@doubledown.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qotVpqmpfSs8tkwF5DMo8O0DDAu8ACqL8hAtCM3CqBN03il0GHH8Q_Uh5Iz8VZXpMir5VtPemilSbAUxDW9ZQACDUjsWCDp5Ngg91_ytOIs=)+1 (206) 773-2266Chief Financial Officerhttps://www.doubledowninteractive.com\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Joseph Jaffoni or Richard LandJCIR+1 (212) 835-8500[DDI@jcir.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=czo7JLuQKolFwXr7_reCSDdjt__mk3NHM37HzRp-Mvqj4rhzsgu-P1eiYXnA8c_KtUQjfuuuzT0CxfZH5jVCbQ==)\n\n**DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts)**  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nAssets| (unaudited)  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 292,651| $| 206,911  \nShort-term investments| 80,000| 67,756  \nAccounts receivable, net| 33,376| 32,517  \nPrepaid expenses, and other assets| 9,895| 8,570  \nTotal current assets| $| 415,922| $| 315,754  \nProperty and equipment, net| 583| 444  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net| 4,450| 7,130  \nIntangible assets, net| 49,377| 51,571  \nGoodwill| 396,887| 396,704  \nDeferred tax asset| 10,936| 28,934  \nOther non-current assets| 1,694| 2,807  \nTotal assets| $| 879,849| $| 803,344  \nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses(1)| $| 13,203| $| 13,293  \nShort-term operating lease liabilities(2)| 917| 3,157  \nIncome taxes payable| 240| 112  \nContract liabilities| 1,482| 2,520  \nCurrent portion of borrowing with related party(3)| -| 38,778  \nOther current liabilities(4)| 3,728| 10,645  \nTotal current liabilities| $| 19,570| $| 68,505  \nLong-term borrowings with related party(5)| 37,890| -  \nLong-term operating lease liabilities(6)| 3,753| 4,420  \nDeferred tax liabilities, net| 360| 848  \nOther non-current liabilities(7)| 2,668| 1,681  \nTotal liabilities| $| 64,241| $| 75,454  \nShareholders’ equity  \nCommon stock, KRW 10,000 par value - 200,000,000 Shares authorized; 2,477,672, issued and outstanding| 21,198| 21,198  \nAdditional paid-in-capital| 359,280| 359,280  \nAccumulated other comprehensive income| 19,253| 19,982  \nRetained earnings| 415,800| 327,273  \nTotal shareholders’ equity attributable to shareowners of DDI Co.
