(NASDAQ: ALTI) (“AlTi” or the “Company”), a leading independent global wealth manager with over $72 billion in combined assets, enabling it to form a strategic partnership with Allianz Global Investors (“AllianzGI”), one of the world’s leading active investment managers and a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz SE (XETRA: ALV), to create a leading private markets offering for the UHNW wealth segment. \n\nThrough the joint venture, AlTi and AllianzGI will launch a private markets investment program for UHNW clients that will benefit from AllianzGI’s exceptional network and scale. By investing alongside Allianz, the program will provide unprecedented access to leading third-party managers with outstanding track records, significant scale benefits, low minimum ticket sizes, and expanded investment opportunities, including secondaries and co-investments. \n\nThe program will initially focus on the approximately $1.5 trillion global private debt market1, leveraging AllianzGI’s long-standing and strong track record in private markets for over 25 years, and unique position in this dynamic and growing asset class. The wider Allianz Group, including AllianzGI, is one of the largest private debt investors worldwide. \n\n**Michael Tiedemann , CEO of AlTi Tiedemann Global, said**: “Our AlTi-Allianz Private Debt Program sets a new benchmark in the UHNW wealth management industry. We are delighted to offer our clients unique access to Allianz’s world-class network of third-party managers at attractive terms and with additional access to co-investments and secondaries. We believe the combined resources of our platforms will provide current and prospective clients with an offering that is unmatched in the alternatives investment space.” \n\n**Tobias Pross , CEO of Allianz Global Investors, said:** “For ultra-high-net-worth individuals and select institutional investors, diversification beyond the public financial markets can help to preserve and grow capital. Private debt’s diversification benefits, coupled with its attractive risk-adjusted returns, make it a compelling component to investors’ portfolios. Through our strategic partnership, we are able to bring some of the best investment opportunities in private markets to the most discerning and dynamic owners of capital in the world. We believe this is only the beginning, as we seek to expand our joint offerings in private markets in the months and years to come.” \n\n**Nazim Cetin , CEO of Allianz X,** **said** : “This partnership is a powerful demonstration of Allianz X’s prowess as a strategic investor and business builder – for its partner companies and the Allianz Group. The formation of our JV with AlTi just months after our initial investment is a first building block of what we can achieve together in the expanding wealth management sector. We’re poised to revolutionize access to the private markets, initially through private debt, and we are confident that investing alongside Allianz will unlock new opportunities for AlTi, Allianz, and the broader UHNW market segment.” \n\nThe AlTi-Allianz Private Debt Program is set to be offered by a semi-liquid evergreen structure designed to invest in all aspects of the private debt markets, covering various strategies, regions, segments, and risk-return profiles, including direct access to secondaries and co-investments. \n\nThe formation of the joint venture and the launch of the private debt program are contingent upon the completion of definitive agreements and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. \n\n**About AlTi**\n\nAlTi Tiedemann Global is a leading independent global wealth manager providing entrepreneurs, multi-generational families, institutions, and emerging next-generation leaders with fiduciary capabilities as well as alternative investment strategies and advisory services.
