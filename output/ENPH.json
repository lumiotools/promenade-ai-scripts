The Domestic Content Bonus Credit is a tax credit that aims to encourage manufacturing and clean energy deployments in the United States as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nThe domestic content bonus tax credit is only available to commercial asset owners, which includes commercial businesses adding solar and PPA/lease providers who own residential solar and battery projects. Projects using Enphase microinverters and batteries supplied from contract manufacturing partners in the United States, as well as a small amount of additional U.S.-made solar racking equipment, could qualify for the tax credits.\n\n“Enphase has been a name our customers trust for solar products, and the IQ Battery 5P is a natural extension of that relationship,” said Ken Lima, CEO of BayWa r.e. Solar Systems. “With manufacturing now happening at U.S. facilities, we’re able to offer a product that not only performs excellently but also aligns with the values of American homeowners who prioritize local innovation and quality. It’s a new chapter for renewable energy that’s built right here at home.”\n\n“We’ve trusted Enphase products for years, and the IQ Battery 5P now being made at U.S. manufacturing facilities is a game changer for our customers,” said Doug Robinson, CEO of LGCY Power. “The proven technology and additional tax benefits ensures we're delivering a reliable, cutting-edge product that our customers can depend on for energy security and savings.”\n\n“We’re excited to begin offering IQ Battery 5Ps produced in the U.S. to households across the country,” said Atul Raj, president at V3 Electric. “It’s a reliable, adaptable solution that now further supports American jobs and energy independence, while delivering the quality our customers expect and trust.”\n\n“This marks a powerful shift for Enphase and our customers,” said Ken Fong, vice president and general manager of the Americas at Enphase Energy. “The launch of IQ Batteries and IQ8 Microinverters from U.S. contract manufacturing facilities is a testament to our focus on providing reliable, forward-thinking solutions that meet the evolving needs of American homeowners. We’re not just advancing clean energy but are also building a foundation for resilient communities by investing in domestic manufacturing and delivering top-tier technology to the market.”\n\nEnphase also [recently began shipping IQ8HC™ Microinverters](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lpCwNM_wW2tngnXYCXxZut7rEiFymLXryM0a2n5VXC4i8Wi6w6wbrJSOmjo93RGWofA5XEJYPep3H14CzvNaFRNH9S_a0OHzZcHnLl-Po-dfYALnZFR52CRsmgg1v6k6RFfsZKN13JddhEjFdKUWf2tK4qeMq2Ose3xG1AlyOe1HHGck7jXnerOBkZeH9jPKfF09ngY4MQfhKTybeHOZU_X-s0PM8CPfYUsMeigj4nD6X1CQUlgqjU00kVSLukxX) supplied from manufacturing facilities in the United States with higher domestic content than previous models.

Enphase IQ8HC™ Microinverters that have SKUs with a “DOM” suffix, paired with other U.S.-made solar equipment, enable IGS Solar-financed leases to qualify for the domestic content bonus tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\n“Safe harboring” is a mechanism that enables developers and financiers like IGS Solar to freeze domestic content requirements from one year to the next. For example, when IGS Solar safe harbors Enphase microinverters in 2024, it makes it easier for their installation partners to meet the domestic content qualifications in 2025 by avoiding any changes to the requirements. This provides IGS Solar’s installation partners with valuable time to formulate and execute a domestic content equipment strategy, while keeping their economics unchanged until they can put a holistic solution in place.\n\nThe domestic content bonus tax credit is only available to commercial asset owners, which includes commercial businesses adding solar and power purchase agreements (PPAs) or lease providers who own residential solar projects. Through this new arrangement, leading solar installers like Venture Solar, Momentum Solar, and Ecohouse Solar will install IGS Solar-owned IQ8 Microinverters supplied from U.S. manufacturing facilities on IGS Solar owned projects, which will help solar projects qualify for the domestic content bonus tax credits.\n\n“We're thrilled to partner with IGS Solar and Enphase to expand the deployment of IQ8 Microinverters produced at U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Alex Yackery, co-founder of Venture Solar. “This collaboration allows us to offer cutting-edge, American solar technology to our customers while helping projects qualify for valuable tax incentives. By aligning with Enphase’s commitment to quality and innovation, we are strengthening our shared mission to advance domestically manufactured clean energy across the country.”\n\n\"This exciting collaboration will bring American products and more world-class, innovative technology to our customers,\" said Arthur Souritzidis, CEO of Momentum Solar. \"It enables us to deliver high-quality and reliable solutions while helping our commercial clients access valuable tax benefits. Working with Enphase, we are able to enhance the value of solar for our customers and contribute to a more sustainable energy landscape in the United States.\"\n\n“Ecohouse’s adoption of Enphase products ushers in a new era of value creation for us and our orbit of stakeholders,” said James Valerioti, director at Ecohouse Solar. “We remain confident and optimistic about the impact domestic manufacturing will have on the industry at large while furthering our country’s goal of energy independence.”\n\n“Integrating Enphase’s domestic content-qualified IQ8 Microinverters into our solar solutions is an extraordinary win for IGS Solar, our partners, and our customers,” said Wesley Hahn, senior director of residential solar at IGS Solar. “The collaboration with the Enphase team combined with the reliability and performance of Enphase products are unmatched. The partnership between IGS Solar and Enphase reinforces our commitment to supporting American manufacturing while delivering top-tier technology to our residential solar customers across the country.”\n\n“This collaboration represents a significant step forward for both Enphase and the solar industry as we continue to expand the availability of microinverters made at our U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Ken Fong, vice president and general manager of the Americas at Enphase Energy. “Working alongside these great companies allows us to better serve homeowners across the country, helping them unlock more value while contributing to the growth of the clean energy economy in America.”\n\nEnphase encourages those interested in the domestic content bonus tax credit to consult their own legal and tax professionals to confirm whether the credit is applicable to them.
