(NASDAQ: OCEA) Announces Publication of New Data Deepening Understanding of Novel Cancer Immunotherapy Treatment Approach Targeting CHI3L1 and its Ability to Inhibit Anti-tumor and Related Tissue Remodeling Responses\n\nOctober 1, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/7956/pdf)\n\n**Ocean Biomedical’s Anti-CHI3L1 patent coverage includes multiple methods of use for targeting a broad range of Cancers that include Lung Cancer, Glioblastoma, Prostate Cancer, Melanoma, and Breast Cancer**\n\nProvidence, RI, Oct. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Ocean Biomedical](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OpFV6aCg7Qg0ICV5F_AyEWxfum2BVDiBD3RfKYwxACBQQ3G5dmS-AZllB7pzceKxWxoa6fUSf9A0XlVWIO9h4jkPNBzSX5GcURwf9_gpdWo=) (NASDAQ:[OCEA](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uCKkDkwMZt2j80N9VCn4pOt76kgg6vgxQope8Cu8njKfxZtEPcEM2ZfhwSHbwfu9qOiEQ3eLI4KyFCc3zMCjlyahuI7tvbjgHNfuGMJFNls=)) announced today that Scientific Co-founder Dr. Jack A. Elias, MD, PhD, and colleagues have [published new research in the Journal of Immunology](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mnnQNapyVHsoK8P48Ss-oR8VHYMgRv8bTkEezcWckQQm5GWJW1S4YVepauyzMDp0CnPu-R0Ixsaerw4D3C7zHYs6uZ2a4RmML4KKiFZrDomloUV0UlvdJqGZkhgK-IW3dtLIbgIa7SvcNV5PwlLuMT_YE11BTNB5JZ6H02-UNPrma4lkcDb9gQEPGXcUHu4bJJJceylsE9-RB_Ol1Ft5CRW7dll3JMk6pMKPeaTkSwJ9q5Kgo5BInuDgvNoJ22-yl03dJUTIrkIt9Lnf400598at0tcGYrEZ032LZbHByLqCIszvXj4HMKncyxAVsgqL) that expands understanding of how CHI3L1 inhibits the body’s natural immune responses to lung cancers and related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This research demonstrates for the first time the complex ways that CHI3L1 inhibits macrophage phagocytosis by stimulating two key phagocytosis checkpoint pathways. The paper notes, “This inhibition of innate immune responses such as phagocytosis provides a mechanistic explanation for the ability of CHI3L1 to stimulate immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPs) and inhibit essential adaptive immune responses in cancer and COPD. The ability of CHI3L1 to simultaneously inhibit innate immune responses, stimulate ICPs, inhibit T cell costimulation, and regulate a number of other oncogenic and inflammation pathways suggests that CHI3L1-targeted therapeutics are promising interventions in cancer, COPD, and other disorders.” Dr. Elias’ research has shown that the inhibition of CHI3L1 diminishes natural adaptive immune responses and reduces cancer growth in vivo in standard and humanized mouse models.\n\nOcean Biomedical’s monoclonal antibody is one piece of a unique oncology platform that is working to build multiple approaches to activating natural cancer immune responses by suppressing Chi3L1, with potential for broad application. The patent allowance has been granted for Prostate Cancer, Colon Cancer, Rectal Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Kidney Cancer, Breast Cancer, Glioblastoma, Melanoma, and Lung Cancer.\n\n“This pathway discovery is an unprecedented leap forward, because if you control Chi3L1, you don’t just control one anti-cancer pathway, you simultaneously control many anti-cancer pathways,” said Dr. Jack A. Elias. “Uncovering the mechanisms by which CHI3L1 works will help us drive cancer research, and eventually treatment and patient outcomes, forward.”\n\nDr. Jack A. Elias is the former Chair of Yale’s Department of Medicine, and the Dean Emeritus of Medicine and Biological Sciences at Brown University. He is a leading pulmonary care specialist and research pioneer. In 2019 he founded Ocean Biomedical with several Brown University colleagues and alums to help address major unmet medical needs by accelerating more discovery science into needed therapeutics.\n\n“This is one more step in a systematic progression towards IND-enabling studies that we hope will move us towards new cancer therapeutics,” commented Ocean Biomedical CEO Elizabeth Ng. “It is exciting because our in-vivo testing has already shown efficacy in humanized mouse models, and we know that this major regulating mechanism is at work in so many cancers.\n\n“We are excited to see Dr. Elias’ work receive this important validation, and we hope to continue deepening our understanding of the CHI3L1 pathways to help us apply our patented technology for the good of patients globally,” commented Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, Ocean Biomedical’s Chairman and Co-founder.\n\n**About Ocean Biomedical **\n\nOcean Biomedical, Inc. is a Providence, Rhode Island-based biopharma company with an innovative business model that accelerates the development and commercialization of scientifically compelling assets from research universities and medical centers.

Artemisinin-based drug therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, but the spread of parasites resistant to this family of compounds threatens recent progress achieved by antimalarial campaigns and underscores the urgent need to identify new anti-malarial drugs.\n\n**Leadership Comments**\n\n“At each step in the process we are learning more about how this “kill switch” mechanism works to interrupt the malaria parasite’s lifecycle, and how we can exploit that on the prevention side and the treatment side,” commented Dr. Jake Kurtis, Scientific Co-founder of Ocean Biomedical, member of Ocean Biomedical’s board of directors and Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Warren Alpert Medical School Brown University.\n\n“The progress we have been able to make thus far in advancing novel targets is a testament to Ocean Biomedical’s innovative model and deep partnership with premier research institutions. We are hopeful that Dr. Kurtis’ discoveries will lead to powerful new treatment options that can save hundreds of thousands of lives, and we are proud to be leading in this important work,” said Elizabeth Ng, Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Biomedical.\n\n“The resurgence of Falciparum malaria worldwide is increasingly alarming and we are pleased to see Dr. Kurtis’ work receive this patent coverage for such an important discovery. We will work hard to accelerate the development of our novel vaccine candidate and this novel class of antimalarial antibodies to get a new treatment option for severe malaria available as soon as possible,” said Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, co-founder and Executive Chairman.\n\n**About Ocean Biomedical**\n\nOcean Biomedical, Inc. is a Providence, Rhode Island-based biopharma company with an innovative business model that accelerates the development and commercialization of scientifically compelling assets from research universities and medical centers.
