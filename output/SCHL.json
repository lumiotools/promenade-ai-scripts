In the seasonally quiet quarter for our school-based channels, first quarter's operating loss improved modestly versus the prior year.\n\n\"Scholastic advanced its strategy as a global children's media and content company last quarter, with engaging and critically acclaimed publishing, a growing slate of exciting media properties in development and production, and early wins from our acquisition of 9 Story Media Group. Scholastic-published titles maintained their presence on bestseller lists during the quarter, including the latest book in Aaron Blabey's Bad Guys® series, with exciting new titles in major global franchises planned for release in the fall and spring. In our integrated Scholastic Entertainment division, we took advantage of early opportunities to monetize and expand the reach of Scholastic IP, with the launch of new The Magic School Bus® and Clifford Classic® channels on advertising-supported distribution platforms. \n\n\"With most children in the U.S. now back at school, our School Reading Events division remains as differentiated and relevant as ever, bringing the excitement of books, reading and stories to millions of kids and families, while generating approximately $200 million in cash and in-kind value last year to support schools and educators. In fiscal 2025 we remain focused on expanding the reach and impact of our Book Fairs and Clubs in this division, while innovating in how we serve our school partners. In our Education Solutions division, we continue to develop new structured literacy programs and supplemental products for schools, scheduled for launch next summer. We are confident these core businesses are well positioned for long-term growth.\n\n\"We remain focused on realizing Scholastic's opportunity to create value and impact this year and beyond. We are affirming our fiscal 2025 guidance and are committed to our capital allocation priorities, including investing in our most compelling growth opportunities to meet the demand for children's books, reading and media from a trusted brand, and returning capital to shareholders.\"\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Q1 Review**\n\nIn $ millions |  **First Quarter** |  **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**Fiscal 2025** |  **Fiscal 2024** |  **$** |  **%**  \nRevenues |  $ |  237.2 |  $ |  228.5 |  $ |  8.7 |  4 %  \nOperating income (loss) |  $ |  (88.5) |  $ |  (99.1) |  $ |  10.6 |  11 %  \nEarnings (loss) before taxes |  $ |  (91.8) |  $ |  (98.0) |  $ |  6.2 |  6 %  \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share |  $ |  (2.21) |  $ |  (2.35) |  $ |  0.14 |  6 %  \nOperating income (loss), ex. one-time items * |  $ |  (85.6) |  $ |  (92.8) |  $ |  7.2 |  8 %  \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share, ex. one-time items * |  $ |  (2.13) |  $ |  (2.20) |  $ |  0.07 |  3 %  \nAdjusted EBITDA * |  $ |  (60.5) |  $ |  (70.6) |  $ |  10.1 |  14 %  \n* Please refer to the non-GAAP financial tables attached  \n  \n**Revenues** increased 4% to $237.2 million, reflecting the contribution of 9 Story Media Group, recorded in the _Entertainment_ segment, partly offset by lower supplemental curriculum and collections product sales in _Education Solutions_. \n\n**Operating loss** decreased 11% to $88.5 million in the quarter, including $2.9 million in one-time charges, compared to $99.1 million a year ago, which included $6.3 million of one-time charges. Excluding one-time charges, operating loss improved 8% from a year ago. The improved seasonal loss primarily reflected increased results in _Children's Book Publishing and Distribution_. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure of operations explained in the accompanying tables) improved 14% to a loss of $60.5 million.\n\n**Quarterly Results**\n\n_Children's Book Publishing and Distribution_\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the _Children's Book Publishing and Distribution_ segment's revenues increased 3% to $105.4 million.\n\n  * Book Fairs revenues were $28.8 million, up 5% from the prior year period. Fairs activity is minimal during the first quarter based on the seasonality of the business. We expect participation at our book fairs to remain strong this school year, with fair count on track to achieve our target of 90,000 fairs in fiscal 2025.\n  * Book Clubs revenues were $2.7 million, in line with the prior year period. Clubs activity is seasonally quiet during the summer months. After strategically transitioning Book Clubs to a smaller, more profitable core business in fiscal 2024, we implemented new strategies to reengage customers this back-to-school season.\n  * Consolidated Trade revenues were $73.9 million, up 2% from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher foreign rights revenues, partly offset by lower frontlist sales compared to the prior year period when the Company released the paperback edition of the fourth book in the Hunger Games® series, _The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes_. Fiscal 2025 revenues are expected to benefit from new releases in the second half of the fiscal year, including the newest book in Dav Pilkey's Dog Man® series and the fifth book in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games® series, _Sunrise on the Reaping_.\n\n\n\nSegment operating loss was $36.6 million, compared to $41.0 million a year ago. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher foreign rights revenues on relatively consistent operating expenses.\n\n_Education Solutions_\n\n_Education Solutions_ revenues decreased 16% to $55.7 million, due to lower sales of supplemental curriculum products, as school districts focus on adopting and implementing new core programs. This was partly offset by increased sales to state-sponsored partners, driven by the growing number of kids participating in these programs.\n\nSegment operating loss was $17.0 million, compared to $18.7 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting higher state-sponsored program revenues, as increases in participation have a significant impact on profitability, and lower operating expenses in the quarter, which more than offset the impact of lower segment revenues.\n\n_Entertainment_\n\nThe newly formed _Entertainment_ segment includes the operations of Scholastic Entertainment Inc. (SEI), which were included in the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment in prior year periods, combined with 9 Story Media Group.\n\nSegment revenues were $16.6 million, primarily reflecting the addition of 9 Story Media Group revenues, which closed in June.\n\nSegment operating loss was $0.5 million which included one-time charges of $1.7 million. Excluding one-time charges, adjusted segment operating income was $1.2 million reflecting the contribution from 9 Story Media Group.\n\n_International_\n\nExcluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $0.2 million, _International_ revenues were in line with the prior year period. Revenues increased on the strong performance of backlist sales in the U.K., which were offset by revenue declines in Canada.\n\nSegment operating loss was $8.3 million compared to $8.2 million in the prior year period, which included one-time charges of $1.2 million in the prior year period. Excluding one-time charges, adjusted operating loss increased $1.3 million.\n\n_Overhead_\n\nOverhead costs were $26.1 million compared to $30.7 million in the prior year period, which included one-time charges of $1.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Excluding one-time charges, adjusted overhead costs decreased $0.7 million driven by lower employee-related expenses.\n\n**Capital Position and Liquidity**\n\nIn $ millions |  **First Quarter** |  **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**Fiscal 2025** |  **Fiscal 2024** |  **$** |  **%**  \nNet cash (used) provided by operating activities |  $ |  (41.9) |  $ |  (38.1) |  $ |  (3.8) |  (10) %  \nAdditions to property, plant and equipment and prepublication expenditures |  (24.4) |  (19.7) |  (4.7) |  (24) %  \nNet borrowings (repayments) of film related obligations |  (2.4) |  — |  (2.4) |  NM  \nFree cash flow (use)* |  $ |  (68.7) |  $ |  (57.8) |  $ |  (10.9) |  (19) %  \nNet cash (debt)* |  $ |  (152.1) |  $ |  119.9 |  $ |  (272.0) |  NM  \n* Please refer to the non-GAAP financial tables attached  \n  \nNet cash used by operating activities was $41.9 million, in line with the prior year period. Free cash use (a non-GAAP measure of operations explained in the accompanying tables) was $68.7 million in fiscal 2025, compared to free cash use of $57.8 million in the prior period, reflecting higher capital expenditures and production spend.\n\nNet debt was $152.1 million compared to a net cash position of $119.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting the Company's borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of 9 Story Media Group.\n\nThe Company distributed $5.7 million in dividends and repurchased 163,194 shares of its common stock for $5.0 million in the first quarter. The Company expects to continue purchasing shares, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we include certain non-GAAP calculations and presentations including, as noted above, \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Free Cash Flow\".

He has also played a pivotal role in creating and implementing our strategy to unlock the potential of Scholastic's trusted brand, beloved content and unique channels. We are already making substantial progress toward our goals of creating long-term value and impact, and I'm thrilled to now have Jeff leading the development and implementation of growth initiatives across Scholastic, working closely with our other strong leaders.\"\n\nMr. Mathews added, \"It is such a privilege to work at Scholastic, one of few companies where doing well truly means doing good. The need for trusted books, media and learning materials that entertain, engage and educate kids has never been more pressing – and Scholastic is uniquely positioned to grow by meeting this need.
