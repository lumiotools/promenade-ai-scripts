Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/BioLineRx Ltd.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2154863/BioLineRx_Ltd_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2154863/BioLineRx_Ltd_Logo.html)\n\n\"The license agreement for APHEXDA that we announced last week was made possible by the tremendous work of our commercial team, who through their hard work proved the significant value that APHEXDA can bring to transplant centers and patients,\" said Philip Serlin, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. \"Our launch progress attracted Ayrmid, who will now, through Gamida Cell, continue to build on the strong commercial foundation that has been laid. We would like to thank our employees for their outstanding contributions to APHEXDA growth and expect this innovative product to reach even more patients with the additional resources from Ayrmid.\n\n\"Looking forward, our streamlined and nimble company has a new financial foundation supported by sales royalties and potential milestone payments, which will allow our experienced team to develop important new therapies in rare disease and oncology that address areas with high unmet need. We will also focus on advancing our motixafortide PDAC program through existing collaborations that require de-minimis investment. Through this strategy, we anticipate delivering near- and long-term value for our shareholders,\" Mr. Serlin concluded. \n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * Executed license agreement with Ayrmid Ltd. to develop and commercialize APHEXDA® (motixafortide) in all indications except solid tumors, and across all territories except Asia\n    * License agreement included a $10 million upfront payment, up to $87 million in potential commercial milestones, and royalties on net sales ranging from 18% to 23%\n    * BioLineRx will supply motixafortide on a cost-plus basis, for both commercial and development supply\n    * Certain members of the BioLineRx U.S.-based commercial organization will be transitioned to Ayrmid Pharma Ltd.\n  * Received $9 million equity investment from certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, to support BioLineRx's pipeline expansion\n  * Operating expense run-rate expected to decrease by more than 70% beginning January 1, 2025 through APHEXDA commercial program transfer and additional headcount reductions\n  * Company intends to evaluate additional asset opportunities in 2025, with a focus on early-stage clinical programs in oncology or rare diseases that address major areas of unmet need\n\n\n\n**Financial Updates**\n\n  * Executed repayment and restructuring agreement with BlackRock EMEA Venture and Growth Lending to repay $16.5 million of approximately $29 million in total debt due; remaining balance will be paid over the next three years at the existing fixed annual interest rate of 9.5 percent\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term bank deposits of $29.2 million\n  * Following the out-license to Ayrmid, the equity investment from Highbridge and the debt repayment to Blackrock, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits are expected to be approximately $20 million, which management believes will be sufficient to fund operations into 2026, as currently planned\n\n\n\n**APHEXDA Launch Updates**\n\n  * Aphexda achieved 10 percent market share milestone of total CXCR4 inhibitor usage in the U.S., which compares APHEXDA to branded MOZOBIL and generic plerixafor in all indications\n  * Institutions ordering APHEXDA increased by 40 percent in the third quarter\n\n\n\n**Clinical Portfolio Updates**** _Motixafortide_**\n\n_Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (mPDAC)_\n\n  * Continued enrollment in the CheMo4METPANC Phase 2b clinical trial collaboration with Columbia University. In addition to Columbia, patient enrollment has begun at Brown University, and three additional sites are anticipated to begin enrollment over the next two quarters. Full enrollment in the randomized trial targeting 108 patients is anticipated in 2027, with a prespecified interim futility analysis planned when 40% of PFS events are observed \n\n\n\n_Multiple Myeloma_\n\n  * Collaboration partner Gloria Biosciences' stem cell mobilization bridging study IND was filed and approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration in China. Anticipate initiation of pivotal clinical trial in 1H 2025\n  * Gloria Biosciences has received regulatory approval to commercialize APHEXDA in the Boao Region of China and Macao, areas in Asia that do not require a bridging study \n\n\n\n_Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) & Gene Therapy_\n\n  * Announced oral presentation at ASH 2024 on initial results from a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating motixafortide as monotherapy and in combination with natalizumab for CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization for gene therapies in sickle cell disease (SCD). Sponsored by investigators at Washington University in St. Louis, the findings from this proof-of-concept study suggest motixafortide alone, and in combination with natalizumab, could support the collection of the large number of stem cells required by gene therapies for sickle cell disease within a single apheresis cycle. The presentation will occur at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition taking place December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, California\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.9 million. The Company did not record any revenue during the third quarter of 2023. Revenue for the quarter reflects a portion of the upfront payment from the Gloria Biosciences license, which amounted to $3.2 million, as well as $1.7 million of net revenue from product sales of APHEXDA in the U.S.\n  * Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.8 million. The Company did not record any cost of revenue during the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue for the quarter primarily reflects the amortization of intangible assets, royalties on net product sales of APHEXDA in the U.S., and cost of goods sold on product sales\n  * Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $2.6 million, compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from lower expenses related to the termination of the development of AGI-134 and a decrease in payroll and share-based compensation\n  * Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.5 million, compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from lower expenses of commercialization activities related to motixafortide. The higher expenses in the corresponding period of 2023 reflect the ramp-up of pre-commercialization activities related to motixafortide\n  * General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.4 million, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from small decreases in a number of G&A expenses\n  * Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $5.8 million, compared to net loss of $16.0 million for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the 2024 period included $0.8 million in non-operating income, compared to non-operating expenses of $3.1 million for the same period in 2023, both primarily related to non-cash revaluation of warrants\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term bank deposits of $29.2 million.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Results Conference Call and Webcast** BioLineRx will report its third quarter 2024 results on November 25, 2024.

(NASDAQ: BLRX) (TASE: BLRX), a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company pursuing life-changing therapies in oncology and rare diseases, and Ayrmid Ltd. (\"Ayrmid\"), the parent company of Gamida Cell Ltd., today announced that on November 20, 2024, the companies entered into a license agreement for motixafortide (commercially sold in the U.S. as APHEXDA®), BioLineRx's FDA-approved stem cell mobilization agent indicated in combination with filgrastim (G-CSF) for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. \n\n![BioLineRx Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2154863/4547338/BioLineRx_Ltd_Logo.jpg)\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, BioLineRx granted Ayrmid an exclusive license to develop and commercialize APHEXDA (motixafortide) across all indications, excluding solid tumor indications, and in all territories other than Asia. BioLineRx previously granted an exclusive license agreement to Gloria Biosciences for APHEXDA (motixafortide) in the Asia region.\n\nIn exchange for the license, BioLineRx will receive a $10 million upfront payment and is also eligible to receive up to an additional $87 million of potential commercial milestones, plus royalties ranging from 18% to 23% on net sales of APHEXDA.\n\nAyrmid will add APHEXDA to its commercial portfolio, which also includes Gamida Cell's OMISIRGE®, the first and only FDA-approved, nicotinamide (NAM)-modified cell therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies in need of a stem cell transplant. As part of this transaction, Ayrmid expects to transition certain members of BioLineRx's U.S.-based commercial organization, who will support both stem cell transplant drugs. \n\nThrough this transaction, BioLineRx will significantly reduce its long-term debt and operational expenses, which will be reviewed in detail during the company's upcoming Q3 results conference call and webcast.\n\nBioLineRx also entered into a share purchase agreement for a $9 million equity investment from certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC. This investment and the combined future potential commercial milestones from licensing agreements with Ayrmid and Gloria Biosciences, as well as royalties on net sales, are expected to provide a strong foundation for BioLineRx to advance its pipeline and identify potential additional assets for development. The equity investment is expected to close today, November 21, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nBioLineRx will continue the development of motixafortide for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through meaningful collaborations, including an active Phase 2b PDAC study led by Columbia University, and supported equally by BioLineRx and Regeneron, as well as a planned Phase 2b PDAC study in China led by Gloria Biosciences.\n\n\"Since APHEXDA's launch last year, patients and transplant centers continue to see the tremendous benefits it can provide, and I could not be prouder of our commercial organization that has proven its value,\" stated **Philip Serlin , Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx**. \"Our agreement with Ayrmid, and their vision of creating a strong commercial transplant portfolio, makes them the ideal partner to realize APHEXDA's full commercial potential. BioLineRx will now leverage its proven expertise in drug development, with a continued focus on oncology and rare diseases. This new path forward aligns with our core strengths and allows us the opportunity to create enduring value for all stakeholders.\" \n\n**Dr. Joe Wiley, Chief Executive Officer of Ayrmid Ltd**, added, \"APHEXDA represents a significant advancement in improving the lives of multiple myeloma patients as they progress along the stem cell transplant journey. APHEXDA complements our existing portfolio by supporting OMISIRGE's growth, doubling our transplant portfolio, and enhancing the capabilities Gamida Cell has already established in cell therapy. Our growing momentum positions us well for continued expansion in the U.S. and beyond, marking a key step in our journey as we continue to build on our success, strengthen our commitment to the transplant community, and execute our long-term strategy.\"\n\nThe equity investment offering is being made by BioLineRx pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-276323) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and declared effective by the SEC on January 5, 2024, and only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement.

Initially supported by the Israeli government, a global pharmaceutical company, and several life-science focused venture capital funds, BioLineRx’s mission was to transition university discoveries into therapeutic potential.\n\nThrough its first six years, the young incubator did just that. BioLineRx advanced multiple programs based on academic research across a range of therapeutic areas and was able to successfully out-license some of its de-risked programs.\n\nLike other regional incubators, BioLineRx’s operating model was to in-license an asset and use its development expertise to establish therapeutic clinical proof-of-concept, at which point they would seek to partner with a pharmaceutical company to conduct larger, pivotal trials and ultimately commercialize the therapy post-approval. As part of this strategy, BioLineRx would earn revenues from development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on future sales.\n\nYet, the unpredictability inherent in drug development, and more stringent partnering requirements, ultimately put pressure on BioLineRx’s incubator operating model. The timing to out-license events was difficult to predict, and pharmaceutical companies established more stringent requirements for bringing in an asset, including randomized data, thus requiring more expensive Phase 2b trials. So, in 2010, BioLineRx took a hard look at its strategy.\n\nMany of the challenges BioLineRx faced are familiar to biopharmaceutical leaders: _Invest too many resources in too many products, and you may deplete your funding before bringing even one product to market. Fail to invest sufficient resources into promising therapies, and you may never discover their potential._\n\nHere’s how BioLineRx effectively focused to create a promising pipeline – and how you can too: \n\n#### **Thoughtfully consider input**\n\nThe process of bringing a new drug to market always involves relationships with scientists, manufacturers, regulators and investors. Use the feedback you receive from these collaborators to direct your efforts and resources. \n\n“If you looked at our pipeline in 2008, you would have found 15 to 20 assets, almost all of them pre-clinical and across multiple disease states,” says Philip Serlin, who became BioLineRx’s Chief Financial and Operating Officer in 2009, and its Chief Executive Officer in 2016.\n\nWhen company leaders considered transitioning from an incubator model to a publicly traded biotech company, they learned that investors were not interested in such a diverse pipeline of early-stage assets. \n\n“Investors felt it was very important to focus,” says Serlin. “They preferred companies with expertise in a dedicated therapeutic area and assets in more advanced stages of development.” \n\n#### **Review your goals and strategy**\n\nIn response, BioLineRx hired a consulting firm to help the company “review the principles upon which BioLineRx was founded,” Serlin says. “Every couple of years, it’s a good idea to see whether your vision or strategy still makes sense.” \n\nAlthough BioLineRx had deliberately nurtured a broad pipeline to reduce risk, company leaders decided to pivot. The business divested all pre-clinical assets and focused exclusively on hematology and oncology. Eventually, BioLineRx selected a lead asset, a next generation CXCR4 inhibitor that held promise in both hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and in cancer immunotherapy. \n\n“We were looking for a clinical stage asset and this one was Phase 2 ready; it already had Phase 1 safety data,” Serlin says. BioLineRx also wanted an asset they could retain control of for as long as possible, and the company’s primary candidate fit the bill. \n\nThe company progressed clinical development, investigating the drug’s impact first in stem cell mobilization for autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma. The goal was to mature the asset and ultimately seek a commercial partner in this indication.\n\nAs the company got closer to regulatory submission, it began examining commercialization opportunities. The company spent a year conducting a full market analysis, and later hired an experienced commercial leader to complete the evaluation.\n\n“From this work it became clear that for this specific indication, and in the U.S., it made more sense for us to commercialize on our own,” says Serlin.\n\n“There are only about 200 bone marrow transplantation centers in the U.S., and the top 80 of them perform over 85% of all bone marrow transplantations,” Serlin says. “We realized this was a custom-made indication for a small company to launch on its own and thus made the decision to do so.” \n\n“While it meant a change in strategy, ultimately, we found that the economics of commercializing on our own in the U.S. were advantageous, and we could ensure a high-level of commitment by our appropriately sized, dedicated sales force,” says Serlin. “When you partner, you lose that control and potentially risk changes in a partner’s priorities, strategy and commitment.”\n\n#### **Persist where there is promise**\n\nTwelve years after going public on NASDAQ, BioLineRx received FDA approval of its lead asset for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells for autologous stem cell transplant in patients with multiple myeloma, and the company remains committed to exploring the full potential of this drug, which shows promise in pancreatic cancer, sickle cell disease and other solid tumors.\n\n“We feel like our best path is to continue our investment in our lead molecule,” Serlin says. “There are still indications that make sense to us.” \n\nThe company and its collaborators are moving forward with two randomized Phase 2b studies evaluating its lead agent in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with pancreatic cancer. The combination potential in pancreatic cancer, as well as other solid tumors, could have significantly larger market potential. \n\nBioLineRx is also partnering with researchers to evaluate its lead agent as a stem cell mobilizer for patients with sickle cell disease who are seeking gene therapy.\n\n“Of all the thousands of molecules that are developed across the globe every year, only a few dozen branded drugs are approved each year,” says Serlin. “We are proud of our journey and are very pleased to see the continued development of biotechnology companies in the region. But what is more important, we are excited to be supporting patients and their families.”\n\nThat is directed persistence in action. By thoughtfully focusing efforts, reviewing goals and strategies, letting go of less promising initiatives, and persisting where promise shines brightest, biopharmaceutical companies can find success. \n\n  * [ ![Post to LinkedIn](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/linkedin.svg?092716141024) ](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A//www.pharmavoice.com/spons/flipping-a-biotech-incubator-into-a-commercial-company/715872/&title=Flipping%20a%20biotech%20incubator%20into%20a%20commercial%20company \"Post\")\n  * [ ![Share on Facebook](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/facebook.svg?440116200824) ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.pharmavoice.com/spons/flipping-a-biotech-incubator-into-a-commercial-company/715872/ \"Share\")\n  * [ ![Post to X](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/x.svg?092716141024) ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Flipping%20a%20biotech%20incubator%20into%20a%20commercial%20company%20https%3A//www.pharmavoice.com/spons/flipping-a-biotech-incubator-into-a-commercial-company/715872/%20via%20@PharmaVoice \"Post\")\n  * [ ![Print this page](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/print.svg?440116200824) ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * ![Email this page](/static/img/social_icons/article_page/email.svg?092716141024)\n\n\n\nFiled Under: [Biotech](/topic/biotech/)\n\n### PharmaVoice stories and insights delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\n\nEmail:\n\n  * Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.industrydive.com/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.industrydive.com/privacy-policy/).
