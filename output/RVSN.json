(Nasdaq: RVSN) (“Rail Vision” or the “Company”), a development stage technology company seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market, today reported financial results for the first half ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We continued to strengthen our foundation during 2024, completing a series of financing transactions that raised gross proceeds of over $12 million. On a business level, securing orders from global leaders and successfully delivering our advanced systems have been important milestones for us. I’m proud to say that all installations have been carried out with industry-leading partners, further strengthening our presence in the U.S. market. The positive feedback we’re receiving from these esteemed customers aligns with our commitment to excellence and innovation, as we continue to implement solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We have also started providing fleet management and data and cloud services that allow our customers to see the actual system performance,” commented Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision. \n\n**First Half 2024 & Recent Highlights:**\n\n**Cash position**\n\nRail Vision started 2024 by securing over $12 million in proceeds to fuel its business through a pair of financing transactions, including a private placement of its shares and warrants, a convertible loan credit facility and exercise of warrants.\n\n**Executing on sales:**\n\n  * **Received $1 million order out of a contract valued at up to $5 million in potential follow-on orders with leading US-based rail and leasing services company:** In April, Rail Vision received an initial purchase order amounting to approximately $1 million as part of a contract valued at up to $5 million in potential follow-on orders with a leading US-based rail and leasing services company that the Company initially announced in January 2024.\n  * In June 2024 Rail Vision **received a follow-on order** from the same customer, in the amount of approximately $200,000, which is in addition to the original agreement and refers to additional services requested by the customer.\n\n\n\n**Engaging with US and global industry leaders:**\n\n  * **Rail Vision Successfully Installed its AI-Driven System for Class 1 US Operator:** In June 2024, Rail Vision completed the successful installation of its AI-driven Shunting Yard product for a Class 1 freight rail US-based company. The North American Class 1 rail company will use the system on its locomotives for evaluation in different scenarios related to safety and efficiency. This installation follows the purchase order, which was announced in March 2024.\n  * **Rail Vision Installed its AI-Driven Product with Loram, a Top US-Based Railway Track Maintenance Supplier: **In June 2024, Rail Vision completed the successful delivery and installation of its AI-driven Shunting Yard product to Loram, a leading US-based provider of railway track maintenance equipment and services. This installation fulfills the purchase order that was announced in April 2024.\n  * **Rail Vision Successfully Installed its AI-based Product at a Leading Global Mining Company: **In June 2024, Rail Vision successfully installed its product at one of Latin America’s leading mining companies. Following a successful delivery, Rail Vision’s team arrived at the mining company’s installation site, where both sides installed the AI-based MainLine product and Rail Vision led training sessions for the mining company’s team.\n  * **Announced first-ever commercial installation of its AI-driven systems in a national railways line:** In February 2024, Rail Vision announced the first ever commercial installation of its AI-driven Main Line Systems in a national railways line, marking a significant milestone in the Company’s journey towards revolutionizing railway safety and efficiency. A successful evaluation process resulted in the purchase of ten Rail Vision Main Line Systems for $1.4 million by Israel Railways.\n\n\n\n**Strengthening IP protection:**\n\nIn August 2024, Rail Vision was granted patent approval from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its innovative AI-based railway obstacle detection system, which followed the Company receiving a notice of allowance from the Japan Patent Office for the same patent application in June 2024. \n\n**First Half 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenues were $761,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, comprised from the mining company that purchased a Rail Vision Main Line System, first installation of Rail Vision’s Main Line Systems in Israel Railways and the successful delivery and installation of Rail Vision’s Shunting Yard product to Loram.\n  * Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were $2,458,000, compared to R&D expenses of $3,682,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in R&D salaries due to a reduction in workforce, including a reduction in the Company employee base by 12 R&D employees and R&D equipment purchases.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were $2,116,000, compared to $2,303,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in salaries and other administrative and operational costs, as part of the process of reducing costs as mentioned above.\n  * As a result of the foregoing, the Company’s operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $4,185,000 compared to an operating loss of $5,985,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n  * Financial expenses amounted to $1,304,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $1,454,000, compared to $150,000 financial income for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the amortization of discount related to a convertible loan credit facility that the Company entered into in January 2024.\n  * GAAP net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $24,324,000, or $1.99 per ordinary share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5,835,000, or $2.69 per ordinary share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $5,394,000 or $0.44 per ordinary share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $5,671,000, or $2.62 per ordinary share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Six months ended****June 30 ,**  \n---  \n(U.S. dollars in thousands, except share data and per share data) | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Results**  \nNet loss | (24,324 | ) | (5,835 | )  \nBasic and diluted loss per share | (1.99 | ) | (2.69 | )  \n**Non-GAAP Results**  \nNet loss | (5,394 | ) | (5,671 | )  \nBasic and diluted loss per share | (0.44 | ) | (2.62 | )  \n  \nA reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided in the financial statements that are part of this release. Non-GAAP results exclude stock-based compensation expenses and revaluation of derivative warrant liabilities.\n\n  * As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $9.7 million, compared to $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase compared to December 31, 2023, is mainly due to the proceeds received from a private placement and credit facility and from warrants exercised by shareholders that occurred in the first half of 2024, totaling $11.5 million gross ($11.3 net proceeds), less cash used during the first half of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company’s earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures of net loss for the period that excludes the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and revaluation of derivative warrant liabilities. The company’s management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors’ understanding and assessment of the company’s on-going operations. Management also uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating business internally and as such deemed it important to provide all this information to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\n**About Rail Vision Ltd.**\n\nRail Vision is a development stage technology company that is seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market.
