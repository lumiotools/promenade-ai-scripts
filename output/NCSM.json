(Nasdaq: NCSM) (the “Company,” “NCS,” “we” or “us”), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Review**\n\nTotal revenues were $44.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $38.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Revenue growth was driven by increases in international services revenues, U.S. product sales, and Canada product sales and services. These gains were partially offset by lower U.S. services revenues and international product sales. The significant increase in international revenues was driven by Middle East tracer work and North Sea frac systems, while the increase in the United States reflects higher frac plug and perforating gun sales by our joint venture, Repeat Precision, LLC (\"Repeat Precision\"). Despite the increase in U.S. revenues, customer activity continues to be negatively impacted by lower natural gas prices. The increase in our Canadian revenue was due in part to higher fracturing systems activity in 2024, as the prior year was impacted more significantly by Canadian wildfires stemming from drought conditions.\n\nCompared to the second quarter of 2024, total revenues increased by 48%, with an increase in Canada of 139%, primarily due to seasonality associated with spring break-up in the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by a decline of 31% in international revenues, primarily associated with the timing of tracer service work in the Middle East, and a 6% decline in the United States.\n\nGross profit was $17.8 million, with a gross margin of 41%, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15.2 million, with a gross margin of 40%, for the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin for 2024 improved due to an increase in higher-margin international work in both the Middle East and North Sea, an increase in frac plug and perforating gun sales in the United States, as well as the benefits realized from operational restructurings enacted in 2023. Adjusted gross profit, which we define as total revenues less total cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization (\"DD&A\"), was $18.5 million, or an adjusted gross margin of 42%, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15.7 million, or 41%, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses totaled $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in expense reflects a higher annual incentive bonus accrual year-over-year partially offset by the benefit of cost-saving measures implemented through our restructuring efforts in 2023.\n\nOther income was $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. This change in other income is primarily attributable to the prior year recovery of unpaid invoices through a litigation settlement and the reversal of a legal contingency fee in 2023 that was not repeated in 2024. This was partially offset in 2024 by increases in royalty income from licensees and the benefit associated with our technical services and assistance agreement with our local partner in Oman. \n\nNet income was $4.1 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $1.77 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the same period a year ago. This improvement is primarily the result of an increase in higher-margin international projects partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses due to higher annual incentive bonus accruals. Our resulting Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18% for the same period a year ago. \n\nCash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million, a $3.5 million improvement compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow, less distributions to non-controlling interest, provided cash of $0.4 million compared to a use of cash of $(3.0) million for the same period in 2023. The overall increase in free cash flow was largely attributed to our operating results, change in net working capital, and a reduction in net cash used in investing activities, partially offset by a distribution to our non-controlling interest. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Expenditures**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, NCS had $15.3 million in cash and $8.6 million in total debt, and a borrowing base under the undrawn asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Facility”) of $21.7 million. Our working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities, was $77.3 million and $71.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nNet working capital, calculated as working capital, less cash and excluding the current maturities of long-term debt, was $64.1 million and $56.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in our net working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in our accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses.\n\nNCS incurred capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, of $0.7 million and $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review and Outlook**\n\nNCS’s Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Hummer commented, “NCS has continued to outperform expectations in a challenging market environment. This quarter marks the third consecutive quarter in which our total revenue has been at the high end or exceeded our expectations, and in which our Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our expectations.\n\nOur revenue for the first nine months of 2024 of $117.6 million is over $10 million, or approximately 10%, higher than the same period last year. Importantly, we are also demonstrating the operating leverage in our business, with a modest improvement in gross margin percentage paired with a reduction in SG&A expenses for these periods. Our resulting Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 is approximately 50% higher than the same period last year, a demonstration of the attractive incremental margins our business can generate as we grow.\n\nThis performance reflects the way our team has embraced and executed our core strategies to build upon our leading market positions, capitalize on international and offshore opportunities and to commercialize innovative solutions to complex customer challenges. One example of this is the 124% improvement in revenue derived outside North America for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 2023, with international revenue comprising 10% of our total revenue in that period, as compared to 5% last year. Our multi-year efforts to grow our customer base in the North Sea and to enter certain markets in the Middle East are being rewarded.\n\nOur team at NCS and Repeat Precision has delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 15% in the U.S. through the first nine months of the year, an impressive performance in light of meaningful reductions in industry activity, whether measured by the rig count or unconventional completion counts.\n\nWe are pairing this growth with improved free cash flow generation, with free cash flow after distributions to non-controlling interest for the first nine months of 2024 of $0.4 million, increasing by more than $3 million as compared to the same period in 2023. We maintain a net cash position of $6.7 million, and had total liquidity of over $37 million as of September 30, 2024, which includes our cash on hand and availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility.\n\nWe expect that we will continue to deliver improved revenue performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 in each of the U.S., Canada and international markets. However, sequentially we expect a 5-15% reduction in revenue in each of these markets, reflecting the potential for a more significant reduction in year-end activity than in prior years for the U.S. and Canadian markets due to industry drilling and completion efficiencies, and more challenging winter operating conditions in selected international markets, including the North Sea. \n\nWe believe the value that we bring to our customers across our product and service portfolio, our continued product and service innovation, and our targeted efforts to penetrate international markets positions us to outperform the anticipated changes in industry drilling and completion activity. As demonstrated thus far in 2024, we believe that this revenue growth, paired with previously enacted and continued efforts to control our operating expenses, will enable higher year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA Margins. \n\nThese results are reflective of the talent, effort and dedication of the outstanding team at NCS and at Repeat Precision. By delivering on our core strategies, we are providing extraordinary outcomes to our customers, driving innovation in the industry and creating value for our shareholders.”\n\n_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Less Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest and Net Working Capital are non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, is non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus share-based compensation expense. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance, legal proceedings for intellectual property as further described below, and certain costs associated with our capital structure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation presents our financial performance in a manner that is comparable to the presentation provided by many of our peers.\n\nWe periodically incur legal costs associated with the assertion of, or defense of, intellectual property, which we exclude from our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, unless we believe that settlement will occur prior to any material legal spend (included in the table below as “Professional Fees”). Although these costs may recur between periods, depending on legal matters then outstanding or in process, we believe the timing of when these costs are incurred does not typically match the settlement or recoveries associated with such matters, and therefore, can distort our operating results. Similarly, we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation the one-time settlement or recovery payment associated with these excluded legal matters when realized but would not exclude any go forward royalties or payments, if applicable. We expect to continue to incur these legal costs for current matters under appeal and for any future cases that may go to trial, provided that the amount will vary by period. \n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet income (loss) | $ | 4,704 | $ | 4,112 | $ | 4,418 | $ | (42,960 | )  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense | (35 | ) | (537 | ) | 722 | (287 | )  \nInterest expense, net | 108 | 27 | 323 | 447  \nDepreciation | 1,188 | 1,001 | 3,395 | 2,892  \nAmortization | 168 | 168 | 502 | 502  \n**EBITDA** | 6,133 | 4,771 | 9,360 | (39,406 | )  \nProvision for litigation, net of recoveries (a) | — | 98 | — | 42,498  \nShare-based compensation (b) | 651 | 1,328 | 2,084 | 3,285  \nProfessional fees (c) | 333 | (375 | ) | 1,263 | 1,286  \nForeign currency exchange (gain) loss (d) | (217 | ) | 157 | 788 | 79  \nSeverance and other termination benefits (e) | — | 671 | — | 980  \nOther (f) | 175 | 145 | 573 | 698  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $ | 7,075 | $ | 6,795 | $ | 14,068 | $ | 9,420  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin** | 16 | % | 18 | % | 12 | % | 9 | %  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation** | $ | 6,424 | $ | 5,467 | $ | 11,984 | $ | 6,135  \n  \n___________________\n\n(a) | Represents litigation provision primarily associated with a legal matter in Texas.

(Nasdaq: NCSM) (the “Company,” “NCS,” “we” or “us”), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Review**\n\nTotal revenues were $29.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to $25.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. Increases in international and U.S. revenues were partially offset by a decrease in Canada revenues. The significant increase in international revenues was driven by North Sea frac systems and Middle East tracer work, and the increase in the United States was driven by frac systems sales. Despite the increase in our U.S. revenues, customer activity continues to be negatively impacted by lower natural gas prices. The decline in our Canada revenues was due in part to certain customers deferring planned frac systems work into the second half of the year due to wet weather conditions and E&P consolidation transactions. \n\nCompared to the first quarter of 2024, total revenues decreased by 32%, with a decrease in Canada of 62%, primarily due to the normal seasonal decline during spring break-up. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in international revenues of 168%, driven by projects in the North Sea and Middle East, and 18% in the United States.\n\nGross profit was $11.3 million, or a gross margin of 38%, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.9 million, or 31%, for the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin for 2024 improved due to an increase in higher-margin international work in both the North Sea and Middle East, higher activity with our customers in the United States and the benefit realized from operational restructurings enacted in 2023. Adjusted gross profit, which we define as total revenues less total cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization (\"DD&A\"), was $12.0 million, or an adjusted gross margin of 40%, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $8.5 million, or 33%, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses totaled $14.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in expense reflects a higher annual incentive bonus accrual year-over-year partially offset by the benefit of cost-saving measures implemented through our restructuring efforts in 2023.\n\nOther income was $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. This change in other income primarily relates to an increase in royalty income from licensees.\n\nNet loss was $(3.1) million, or $(1.21) per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to net loss of $(32.2) million, or $(13.02) per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2023 was impacted by a $24.9 million litigation provision primarily associated with a jury verdict in Texas issued against us in early May 2023. In December 2023, we settled the matter whereby the insurance carrier agreed to pay the mutually-agreed settlement amounts to the plaintiff in an amount within insurance coverage limits, with no cash impact to NCS. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $3.2 million compared to the same period a year ago. This improvement is primarily the result of an increase in higher-margin international projects and an increase in our royalty income (other income) partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses due to higher incentive bonus accruals. Our resulting Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 improved from (9)% for the same period a year ago. \n\nCash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $4.1 million, a $5.1 million improvement compared to the same period in 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, free cash flow, less distributions to non-controlling interest, provided cash of $3.2 million compared to a use of cash of $(2.0) million for the same period in 2023. The overall increase in free cash flow was largely attributed to our operating results, change in net working capital, and a reduction in net cash used in investing activities, partially offset by a distribution to our non-controlling interest. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Expenditures**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, NCS had $18.6 million in cash and $8.9 million in total debt, and a borrowing base under the undrawn asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Facility”) of $14.4 million. Our working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities, was $71.9 million and $71.2 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net working capital, calculated in the same manner as working capital, with the exception of excluding cash from current assets and excluding current maturities of long-term debt from current liabilities, was $55.4 million and $56.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nNCS incurred capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, of $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review and Outlook**\n\nNCS’s Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Hummer commented, “NCS continued its strong start to 2024, with our total revenue in the second quarter near the high end of our expectations and our Adjusted EBITDA exceeding the expectations we provided in our last earnings call. This was led by revenue outperformance in the U.S. and international markets, gross margin benefits from higher international activity and increased royalty income.\n\nOur total revenue in the second quarter of 2024 of $29.7 million grew by $4.3 million, or 17%, compared to the second quarter of last year. This was primarily the result of our concerted effort to grow our international revenues in the North Sea, where we have been growing our customer base for fracturing systems work, and the Middle East, where we are primarily supporting our customers with our tracer diagnostics services. Our total revenue for the first half of 2024 of $73.5 million was 7% higher than the year-ago period. \n\nOur adjusted gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 of 40%, significantly higher than 33% for the same period last year, exceeded the high end of our second quarter adjusted gross margin guidance. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $3.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2024 was $7.0 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4.4 million. The year-over-year improvement for the first six months included contributions from increased revenue, higher adjusted gross margins, lower SG&A expense and increased other income, primarily royalty income generated from licensing of certain intellectual property. \n\nDuring the first six months of 2024, we generated free cash flows, less distributions to our non-controlling interest, of $3.2 million, an increase of $5.2 million to the same period one year ago. This has further strengthened our balance sheet, as our cash balance as of June 30, 2024 is up to $18.6 million, with only $8.9 million of total debt which consisted entirely of finance leases.\n\nWe believe that average 2024 industry drilling and completion activity in Canada will be flat to slightly higher compared to 2023 and activity in the United States will decline on average by 5% to 10% compared to 2023. We expect international industry activity to improve on average by approximately 5% in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenues to improve year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year expected revenue increase is driven by an increase in international revenues and increased sales at Repeat Precision in the U.S. The sequential improvement will be driven by our Canada operations as customer activity increases following the seasonal spring break-up in the second quarter, offset by modest sequential declines in our U.S. and international operations.\n\nWe believe the value that we bring to our customers across our product and service portfolio, our continued product and service innovation, and our targeted efforts to penetrate international markets positions us to outperform the anticipated changes in industry drilling and completion activity, and to grow our revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023. As we demonstrated during the first half of 2024, we believe that this revenue growth, paired with previously enacted and continued efforts to control our operating expenses, will enable higher year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA Margins. \n\nThese results reflect the talent, effort and dedication of the outstanding team at NCS and at Repeat Precision. We are delivering on our core strategies to build upon our leading market positions, capitalize on opportunities in international and offshore markets and to bring new and innovative solutions to our customers around the world. Through these strategies, we are delivering extraordinary outcomes to our customers, driving innovation in the industry and creating value for our shareholders.”\n\n_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted (Loss) Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Less Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest and Net Working Capital are non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, is non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus share-based compensation expense. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance, legal proceedings for intellectual property as further described below, and certain costs associated with our capital structure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation presents our financial performance in a manner that is comparable to the presentation provided by many of our peers.\n\nWe periodically incur legal costs associated with the assertion of, or defense of, intellectual property, which we exclude from our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, unless we believe that settlement will occur prior to any material legal spend (included in the table below as “Professional Fees”). Although these costs may recur between periods, depending on legal matters then outstanding or in process, we believe the timing of when these costs are incurred does not typically match the settlement or recoveries associated with such matters, and therefore, can distort our operating results. Similarly, we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation the one-time settlement or recovery payment associated with these excluded legal matters when realized but would not exclude any go forward royalties or payments, if applicable. We expect to continue to incur these legal costs for current matters under appeal and for any future cases that may go to trial, provided that the amount will vary by period. \n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30 ,** | **June 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss | $ | (2,839 | ) | $ | (32,076 | ) | $ | (286 | ) | $ | (47,072 | )  \nIncome tax expense | 270 | 1,350 | 757 | 250  \nInterest expense, net | 115 | 211 | 215 | 420  \nDepreciation | 1,134 | 948 | 2,207 | 1,891  \nAmortization | 167 | 167 | 334 | 334  \n**EBITDA** | (1,153 | ) | (29,400 | ) | 3,227 | (44,177 | )  \nProvision for litigation, net of recoveries (a) | — | 24,886 | — | 42,400  \nShare-based compensation (b) | 667 | 1,044 | 1,433 | 1,957  \nProfessional fees (c) | 677 | 577 | 930 | 1,661  \nForeign currency exchange loss (gain) (d) | 507 | (23 | ) | 1,005 | (78 | )  \nSeverance and other termination benefits (e) | — | 309 | — | 309  \nOther (f) | 218 | 362 | 398 | 553  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $ | 916 | $ | (2,245 | ) | $ | 6,993 | $ | 2,625  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin** | 3 | % | (9 | %) | 10 | % | 4 | %  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation** | $ | 249 | $ | (3,289 | ) | $ | 5,560 | $ | 668  \n  \n___________________\n\n(a) | Represents litigation provision primarily associated with a legal matter in Texas.

We define free cash flow less distributions to non-controlling interest as free cash flow less amounts reported in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows as distributions to non-controlling interest. We believe free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs.
