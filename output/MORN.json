(Nasdaq: MORN), a leading provider of independent\ninvestment insights, posted double-digit third-quarter revenue growth while expanding operating\nmargins.\n\"Morningstar Credit led the way in the quarter with additional contributions from across the business\nsupporting revenue and profit growth,\" said Kunal Kapoor, Morningstar's chief executive officer. \"Our\ndiverse portfolio continues to present opportunities for innovation and durable growth, including those\narising from the accelerated convergence of public and private markets.\"\nThe Company's quarterly shareholder letter provides more context on its quarterly results and business\nperformance and can be found at shareholders.morningstar.com.\nThird-Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n• Reported revenue increased 10.5% to $569.4 million compared to the prior-year period; organic\nrevenue grew 10.1%.\n• Reported operating income increased 65.0% to $115.5 million; adjusted operating income\nincreased 41.6%.\n• Diluted net income per share increased 204.4% to $2.77; adjusted diluted net income per share\nincreased 56.3% to $2.00. The gain related to the Company's sale of its Commodity and Energy\nData business in the quarter had a $1.05 impact on diluted net income per share.\n• Cash provided by operating activities increased 46.8% to $191.9 million. Free cash flow\nincreased 53.6% to $155.8 million. Cash flows were negatively impacted by certain items\ntotaling $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $16.1 million in the prior-year period.\nExcluding these items, cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow would have\nincreased by 31.3% and 33.4%, respectively.\nYear-To-Date Financial Highlights\n• Reported revenue increased 12.3% to $1.7 billion compared to the prior-year period; organic\nrevenue grew 12.2%.\n• Reported operating income increased 132.5% to $316.6 million; adjusted operating income\nincreased 74.3%.\n• Diluted net income per share increased 271.5% to $5.87; adjusted diluted net income per share\nincreased 83.4% to $5.76. The gain related to the Company's sale of its Commodity and Energy\nData business in the quarter had a $1.05 impact on diluted net income per share.\n• Cash provided by operating activities increased 145.4% to $438.2 million. Free cash flow\nincreased 275.5% to $336.1 million. Cash flows were negatively impacted by certain items\ntotaling $0.9 million for the year-to-date, compared with $90.6 million in the prior-year period.\nExcluding these items, cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow would have\nincreased by 63.1% and 87.1%, respectively.\nThird-Quarter 2024 Results\nRevenue increased 10.5% to $569.4 million on a reported basis and 10.1% on an organic basis versus\nthe prior-year period, driven by strength across most of the business. Organic revenue growth\nexcludes all foreign currency effects, which accounted for the entire difference between reported and\norganic revenue. Morningstar Credit, PitchBook, and Morningstar Data and Analytics were the biggest\ncontributors to reported revenue growth.\nOperating expense increased 1.9% to $453.9 million versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact\nof M&A-related expenses (related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including severance\nand earn-outs), amortization, and costs related to the transition of the Company's China activities in\nthe prior-year period, operating expense increased 3.7%. Prior-year period operating expense included\n$6.0 million in SEC settlement-related expenses for DBRS, Inc. and $5.0 million in severance costs\nrelated to targeted reorganizations in certain parts of the business.\nThe largest contributors to the increase in reported operating expense were compensation costs and\ntechnology infrastructure costs.\n• Compensation costs increased $16.2 million, due primarily to higher bonus costs, which\nreflected increased accruals due to favorable performance compared to targets in certain parts\nof the business.\n• Technology infrastructure costs consisting of expenses related to SaaS-based software\nsubscriptions and cloud computing increased $4.0 million.\nPage 2 of 15\nThird-quarter operating income increased 65.0% to $115.5 million. Adjusted operating income was\n$130.3 million, an increase of 41.6%. Third-quarter operating margin was 20.3%, compared with\n13.6% in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in the third quarter of 2024,\nversus 17.8% in the prior-year period.\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 was $119.7 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, compared with\nnet income of $39.1 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of\n204.4% on a per share basis. Adjusted diluted net income per share increased 56.3% to $2.00 in the\nthird quarter of 2024, compared with $1.28 in the prior-year period. Net income included a $45.3\nmillion gain related to the sale of the Company's Commodity and Energy Data business which had a\n$1.05 impact on diluted net income per share.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 19.8% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 29.9% in the\nprior-year period. The decrease is primarily due to the book gain in excess of taxable gain on the sale\nof its Commodity and Energy Data business in the third quarter of 2024.\nSegment Highlights\nMorningstar Data and Analytics\nMorningstar Data and Analytics contributed $198.5 million to consolidated revenue and $9.8 million to\nconsolidated revenue growth, with revenue increasing 5.2% compared to the prior-year period, or\n4.7% on an organic basis. Higher revenues were primarily driven by growth in Morningstar Direct and\nMorningstar Data. This growth was partially offset by softness in research distribution, reflecting the\nloss of a large client who brought coverage in-house, and in Morningstar Advisor Workstation, due to\nrevenue declines related to an evolving product strategy. Morningstar Direct benefited from growth\nacross geographies, with licenses increasing 1.4%. Increases in managed investment (fund) data and\nMorningstar Essentials helped drive Morningstar Data growth, partially offset by softness in exchange\nmarket data.\nMorningstar Data and Analytics adjusted operating income increased 3.4% to $91.4 million, and\nadjusted operating margin decreased 0.8 percentage points to 46.0% compared to the prior-year\nperiod, due in part to higher stock-based compensation.\nPitchBook\nPitchBook contributed $156.6 million to consolidated revenue and $17.0 million to consolidated\nrevenue growth, with revenue increasing 12.2% on a reported and organic basis compared to the\nprior-year period. Higher revenue was primarily driven by the PitchBook platform, with licensed users\ngrowing 19.0%. PitchBook clients who were not previously Leveraged Commentary & Data (LCD)\nclients drove the majority of the increase in licensed users, although growth continued to reflect the\nimpact of legacy LCD clients who have moved to the PitchBook platform and are now reflected in\nPage 3 of 15\nlicensed user counts. PitchBook platform growth drivers were consistent with recent quarters and\nreflected strength in PitchBook's core investor and advisor client segments, including venture capital,\nprivate equity, and investment banks. This was partially offset by continued softness in the corporate\nclient segment, especially with smaller firms with more limited use cases.\nPitchBook segment adjusted operating income increased 28.9% to $50.4 million, and adjusted\noperating margin increased 4.2 percentage points to 32.2%.\nMorningstar Credit\nMorningstar Credit contributed $70.9 million to consolidated revenue and $18.0 million to\nconsolidated revenue growth, with revenue increasing 34.0% on a reported and organic basis\ncompared to the prior-year period. Ratings-related revenue increased across asset classes and\ngeographies, compared to a relatively soft prior-year period, with particular strength in commercial\nmortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, and asset-based securities.\nHigher corporate ratings revenue also contributed to growth.\nMorningstar Credit adjusted operating income was $15.2 million compared with $2.8 million in the\nprior-year period, and adjusted operating margin was 21.4% compared with 5.3% in the prior-year\nperiod. Prior-year period operating expense included $6.0 million in costs related to the DBRS, Inc.\nSEC settlement and $1.1 million in severance related to targeted reorganizations.\nMorningstar Wealth\nMorningstar Wealth contributed $61.8 million to consolidated revenue and $3.8 million to\nconsolidated revenue growth, with revenue increasing 6.6% compared to the prior-year period, or\n6.1% on an organic basis. Growth was primarily driven by Investment Management, supported by\nhigher revenue for strategist model portfolios offered on third-party platforms, which was partially\noffset by softness in advertising sales for Morningstar.com.\nReported assets under management and advisement (AUMA) increased 25.6% to $63.7 billion\ncompared with the prior-year period, helped by strong market performance which drove higher asset\nvalues. Positive net flows to Morningstar Managed Portfolios over the trailing 12 months primarily\nreflected net inflows outside the United States and to strategist portfolios in the United States.\nMorningstar Wealth adjusted operating loss was $0.7 million compared to an $8.2 million loss in the\nprior-year period, and adjusted operating margin was negative 1.1% compared with negative 14.1%.\nPrior-year period operating expense included $1.4 million in severance related to targeted\nreorganizations.\nPage 4 of 15\nMorningstar Retirement\nMorningstar Retirement contributed $31.8 million to consolidated revenue and $4.1 million to\nconsolidated revenue growth, with revenue increasing 14.8% on a reported and organic basis\ncompared to the prior-year period. AUMA increased 24.2% to $264.4 billion compared with the prior-\nyear period, reflecting market gains and positive net flows, supported by strong growth in Advisor\nManaged Accounts.\nMorningstar Retirement adjusted operating income increased 15.0% to $16.9 million, and adjusted\noperating margin was 53.1%, consistent with the prior-year period.\nCorporate and All Other\nRevenue attributable to Corporate and All Other contributed $49.8 million to consolidated revenue and\n$1.2 million to consolidated revenue growth, with revenue increasing 2.5% compared to the prior-year\nperiod, driven by growth in Morningstar Indexes.\nThe increase in Morningstar Indexes revenue was primarily due to higher investable product revenue\nas market performance and net inflows over the trailing 12 months increased asset value linked to\nMorningstar Indexes by 37.5% to $228.2 billion.\nMorningstar Sustainalytics revenues declined compared to the prior-year period. The decline was\nlargely driven by lower revenues for ESG Risk Ratings, reflecting increased cancellations due to vendor\nconsolidation and softness in parts of the retail asset management and wealth client segments.\nRevenue was also negatively impacted by further streamlining of licensed-ratings offerings.\nThe impact of Corporate and All Other on consolidated adjusted operating income was negative $42.9\nmillion compared with negative $44.8 million in the prior-year period. Prior-year period operating\nexpense included $2.5 million in severance related to targeted reorganizations in Morningstar\nSustainalytics.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Allocation\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $601.7\nmillion and $864.7 million of debt, compared with $389.0 million and $972.4 million, respectively, as of\nDec. 31, 2023.\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $191.9 million in the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to $130.7 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow increased to $155.8 million,\ncompared to $101.4 million in the prior-year period. The increases in cash provided by operating\nactivities and free cash flow were driven by both higher cash earnings and improvements in working\ncapital. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by $0.9 million in severance related to the\nexpected sale of assets from the Morningstar Wealth Turnkey Asset Management Platform to\nAssetMark. As previously disclosed, operating cash flows were negatively impacted in the prior-year\nPage 5 of 15\nperiod by certain items totaling $16.1 million. Excluding these items, cash provided by operating\nactivities and free cash flow would have increased by 31.3% and 33.4%, respectively. In addition, the\nCompany paid $17.4 million in dividends in the quarter.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures\nused by the Company to comparable GAAP measures and an explanation of why the Company uses\nthem.\nInvestor Communication\nMorningstar encourages all interested parties — including securities analysts, current shareholders,\npotential shareholders, and others — to submit questions in writing.

Morningstar excludes revenue from\nacquired businesses from its organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after it completes the acquisition. For divestitures,\nMorningstar excludes revenue in the prior-year period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period.\nMorningstar presents adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted net income per share to show the effect of\nsignificant acquisition and divestiture activity, better compare period-over-period results, and improve overall understanding of the underlying\nperformance of the business absent the impact of M&A and the shift of Morningstar's operations in China.\nIn addition, Morningstar presents free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available\nafter making capital expenditures. Morningstar's management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the health of its business. Free cash flow should\nnot be considered an alternative to any measure required to be reported under GAAP (such as cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and\nfinancing activities).\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nReconciliation from consolidated revenue to organic\nrevenue:\nConsolidated revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 10.5 % $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9 12.3 %\nLess: acquisitions — — — % — — — %\nLess: accounting changes — — — % — — — %\nEffect of foreign currency translations (1.6) — NMF (1.4) — NMF\nOrganic revenue $ 567.8 $ 515.5 10.1 % $ 1,682.7 $ 1,499.9 12.2 %\nReconciliation from consolidated operating income to\nadjusted operating income:\nConsolidated operating income $ 115.5 $ 70.0 65.0 % $ 316.6 $ 136.2 132.5 %\nAdd: Intangible amortization expense (1) 14.7 17.7 (16.9) % 49.9 52.9 (5.7) %\nAdd: M&A-related expenses (2) 0.1 1.7 (94.1) % 5.6 8.9 (37.1) %\nAdd: Severance and personnel expenses (3) — 1.3 NMF — 5.4 NMF\nAdd: Transformation costs (3) — 0.6 NMF — 7.0 NMF\nAdd: Asset impairment costs (3) — 0.7 NMF — 3.1 NMF\nAdjusted operating income $ 130.3 $ 92.0 41.6 % $ 372.1 $ 213.5 74.3 %\nReconciliation from consolidated operating margin to\nadjusted operating margin:\nConsolidated operating margin 20.3 % 13.6 % 6.7 pp 18.8 % 9.1 % 9.7 pp\nAdd: Intangible amortization expense (1) 2.6 % 3.4 % (0.8) pp 3.0 % 3.5 % (0.5) pp\nAdd: M&A-related expenses (2) — % 0.3 % (0.3) pp 0.3 % 0.6 % (0.3) pp\nAdd: Severance and personnel expenses (3) — % 0.3 % (0.3) pp — % 0.4 % (0.4) pp\nAdd: Transformation costs (3) — % 0.1 % (0.1) pp — % 0.5 % (0.5) pp\nAdd: Asset impairment costs (3) — % 0.1 % (0.1) pp — % 0.2 % (0.2) pp\nPage 14 of 15\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nAdjusted operating margin 22.9 % 17.8 % 5.1 pp 22.1 % 14.3 % 7.8 pp\nReconciliation from consolidated diluted net income per\nshare to adjusted diluted net income per share:\nConsolidated diluted net income per share $ 2.77 $ 0.91 204.4 % $ 5.87 $ 1.58 271.5 %\nAdd: Intangible amortization expense (1) 0.25 0.31 (19.4) % 0.86 0.91 (5.5) %\nAdd: M&A-related expenses (2) — 0.03 NMF 0.10 0.15 (33.3) %\nAdd: Severance and personnel expenses (3) — 0.02 NMF — 0.09 NMF\nAdd: Transformation costs (3) — 0.01 NMF — 0.12 NMF\nAdd: Asset impairment costs (3) — 0.01 NMF — 0.05 NMF\nLess: Non-operating (gains) losses and other (4) (1.02) (0.01) NMF (1.07) 0.24 NMF\nAdjusted diluted net income per share $ 2.00 $ 1.28 56.3 % $ 5.76 $ 3.14 83.4 %\nReconciliation from cash provided by operating activities to\nfree cash flow:\nCash provided by operating activities $ 191.9 $ 130.7 46.8 % $ 438.2 $ 178.6 145.4 %\nCapital expenditures (36.1) (29.3) 23.2 % (102.1) (89.1) 14.6 %\nFree cash flow $ 155.8 $ 101.4 53.6 % $ 336.1 $ 89.5 275.5 %\n______________________________________________________________________\nNMF - Not meaningful, pp - percentage points\n(1) Excludes finance lease amortization expense of $0.1 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $0.5 million and $1.0 million during the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Reflects non-recurring expenses related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including pre-deal due diligence, transaction costs,\nseverance, and post-close integration costs.\n(3) Reflects costs associated with the significant reduction of the Company's operations in Shenzhen, China, and the shift of work related to its global\nbusiness functions to other Morningstar locations.\nSeverance and personnel expenses include severance charges, incentive payments related to early signing of severance agreements, transition\nbonuses, and stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock unit and market stock unit awards.

          "content": "Letter from CEO Kunal Kapoor\nThird-Quarter Earnings 2024\nDear Morningstar shareholders,\nIn the third quarter of 2024, revenue increased 10.5%, or 10.1% on an organic basis. Operating margins and cash flow grew significantly compared to the\nprior-year period.\nBefore I dive into an update, we announced today that Jason Dubinsky, our chief financial officer for the past seven-plus years, will step down at the\nend of this year to pursue other interests. Jason has been a terrific partner to me over his Morningstar tenure, and shareholders have benefited from his\nsteadfast stewardship of the business. Jason leads a strong finance function that has and will continue to evolve to support the needs of our growing\nglobal organization. To ensure a smooth transition, Jason will remain engaged as a consultant through June 30, 2025, and we look forward to\ncelebrating his leadership and friendship over the years. We are evaluating candidates to succeed Jason and will provide an update at a later date.\nAnother strong quarter for Morningstar Credit\nMorningstar Credit had another top-notch quarter, making it the largest contributor to revenue growth. Overall, while increased CMBS ratings revenue\nhas been an important driver of our strong year-to-date results, we’re also seeing strength in other areas of the structured finance market and\ncorporates. We’re pleased to see our efforts to diversify revenue drivers paying off.\nWe saw growth across most other parts of the business in the quarter, including PitchBook and Morningstar Data and Analytics, while continued\nstrength in financial markets helped support growth in revenue tied to assets under management.\nMorningstar Sustainalytics was an exception to this strong showing, with a revenue slowdown reflecting challenges in a few areas, including ESG Risk\nRatings, where vendor consolidation and softness in parts of the retail asset and wealth client segments has hurt, and in licensed ratings, where we’ve\nshifted our approach. While recent results are disappointing, we believe that the changes we’ve made in licensed ratings, together with enhancements\nto the ESG Risk Ratings launched in May and the recent extension of our EU Action Plan solutions, will support growth over the long-term.\nTurning to expenses, we’re continuing to manage costs effectively. Operating income increased 65% to $115.5 million and adjusted operating income\nincreased 41.6% to $130.3 million, compared to the prior-year period. Operating margin increased from 13.6% to 20.3%, and adjusted operating margin\nincreased from 17.8% to 22.9%. We remain focused on durable growth and increasing revenues at a faster rate than expenses over time.\nOur increased profitability supported higher operating and free cash flows during the quarter. We reduced outstanding debt by $35.0 million and paid a\ndividend of 40.5 cents per share, or $17.4 million, in the quarter.\nPublic-private market convergence: the opportunity\nThe past few months have seen a flurry of activity that signals accelerated efforts to bring private market investments to an ever-wider audience.\nNotable announcements include BlackRock’s acquisitions of Global Infrastructure Partners and Preqin, Capital Group’s collaboration with KKR to make\nhybrid-public private market solutions available to retail investors, Janus Henderson’s acquisition of Victory Park Capital, and State Street and Apollo’s\nplans to launch what would be a first-of-its-kind actively managed exchange-traded fund to invest in public and private credit.\nOf course, private market investing is hardly new. Pensions, endowments, and foundations have invested across a mix of public and private assets for\nmore than two decades. But with private markets’ rapid growth to more than $13 trillion in assets as of June 2023 and a history of attractive returns, the\nasset management industry is increasingly determined to bring private market investments to retail investors, enabling portfolio diversification alongside\nhigher management fees. Morningstar was early to predict the growing convergence of public and private markets, and we believe that no one has\nbetter building blocks in place to support investors of all sizes, whether they are new to investing in private assets or already established players.\nThat growth has helped fuel PitchBook’s success since we acquired it, with revenues increasing from $31.1 million for the trailing 12 months ended June\n30, 2016 to $583.3 million for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2024. Along the way, we’ve invested to expand PitchBook’s capabilities and the\nreach of its data. Today, PitchBook is a platform that hosts all of Morningstar’s private market data and research together with our public equity data and\nresearch. Building on our 2022 acquisition of Leveraged Commentary & Data, we also now offer news, data, and research for the leveraged finance and\n© Oct. 23, 2024. Morningstar. All Rights Reserved.\nLetter from CEO Kunal Kapoor\nThird-Quarter Earnings 2024\nprivate credit markets. We’ve further enriched the platform with proprietary IP, including the recently launched Manager Scores, which rank asset\nmanagers’ various fund families by strategy using a proprietary methodology designed to help limited partners evaluate a manager’s track record.\nWhile PitchBook will continue to be a key part of our value proposition as we look to the further convergence of public and private markets, the\nopportunity touches just about every part of the business, including, importantly, our Morningstar Data and Analytics segment. Here we bring deep\nexpertise in building portfolio analytics and tools, developed over decades, and coverage of a wide range of investment vehicles, including open-end and\nexchange-traded funds, interval funds, separately managed accounts, and model portfolios. We are keenly focused on adapting these tools to help\ninvestors analyze portfolios that span public and private markets. To that end, our data teams are working to enable better portfolio analytics, including\nPortfolio X-Ray, Morningstar Portfolio Risk Score, and liquidity tools for portfolios that hold private assets. Other items on our road map include a\nstandalone interval fund universe that enables better discoverability in Direct and an updated classification schema for alternative investments.\nExpansion of private market investments to retail investors will require improved benchmarking capabilities, and there’s also demand from asset owners\nand other institutional investors in this space. PitchBook continues to enhance its series of benchmarks covering all private market asset classes to help\ninvestors understand fund performance across asset class, industry, size, and vintage year, and providing transparency down to the underlying fund level\nin each benchmark. Meanwhile, Morningstar Indexes is also working closely with PitchBook in an ongoing effort to deliver better private market indexes,\nwhich includes the next generation of Morningstar PitchBook Global Unicorn Indexes.\nAs retirement plan sponsors consider adding private market options to retirement plans through target date funds and managed accounts, Morningstar\nRetirement is developing a scalable approach to modeling and allocating to private markets. This would include identifying key factors for plan sponsors\nto consider when adding investment options, modeling the characteristics of private market vehicles to aid comparison to other vehicles, and extending\nour personalized retirement plan participant portfolio construction methodology to include private market investments or working with advisor managed\naccounts where the advisory firm would determine the own allocation.\nFurther, public-private credit market convergence presents a particularly attractive opportunity for Morningstar Credit. As banks have increasingly looked\nto reduce on-balance sheet risks, an increasing share of debt market financing has moved to the private arena. By early 2024, private credit markets had\ngrown to roughly $1.5 trillion in assets – on par with the size of the high-yield credit market—and are forecasted to nearly double by 2028. That growth\nis expected to drive a surge in demand for private credit ratings in sectors ranging from so-called esoteric asset-backed securities and asset-based\nlending to investment-grade and non-investment grade private placement corporate transactions. Morningstar Credit has already made meaningful\ninroads in private credit and can serve this market with its already existing methodologies. We believe we’re well-positioned given the private market’s\nfocus on execution and relationships, which we view as our competitive strengths.\nSince Joe Mansueto founded Morningstar 40 years ago, we’ve focused on our mission of empowering investor success, and a key part of that mission is\nhelping investors make sense of the ever-changing investing landscape through our insights and tools. The rapid growth of private markets and their\nextension to retail investors presents a whole new set of opportunities and risks that have not previously been on the menu. We’re ready to bring much-\nneeded transparency to this space.\nSale of Morningstar Commodity and Energy Data\nFinally, a quick note on a change in our Data and Analytics segment. At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Morningstar Commodity &\nEnergy Data business to ZEMA Global Data Corporation for $52.4 million, which is not included in the Morningstar Data product area. We initially\nentered this business with the acquisition of Logical Information Machines at the end of 2009, with the thesis that the datasets would prove to be\ncomplementary to our core data offering. While we’ve been pleased with the product’s performance and contributions to profit, we found that its buyer\nbase has remained distinct from our core client segments, and we haven’t seen a meaningful opportunity to cross-sell with our other data. We ultimately\ndecided that the business would best fit with a firm that was singularly focused on this segment of the market, driving the decision to sell it. If a\nbusiness doesn’t integrate with our broader offering and enable us to better meet our clients’ needs, we will focus elsewhere.\n© Oct. 23, 2024. Morningstar.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Basis of Presentation of Interim Financial Information\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries (Morningstar, we, our, the company) have\nbeen prepared to conform to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The preparation of financial\nstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn the opinion of management, the statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly our\nfinancial position, results of operations, equity, and cash flows. These financial statements and notes are unaudited and should be read in\nconjunction with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (our Annual Report).\nThe acronyms that appear in the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements refer to the following:\nASC: Accounting Standards Codification\nASU: Accounting Standards Update\nFASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are included in Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual\nReport.\nDivestitures: We may sell certain portions of our business from time to time for various reasons. In accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property,\nPlant, and Equipment (FASB ASC 360), we classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria\nare met: management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale; the sale and transfer of\nthe disposal group is expected within one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to\nits current fair value; and it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. A disposal group that is\nclassified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and the assets are not\ndepreciated or amortized.\nIf the disposal group meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within the reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on its\nrelative fair value. When the disposal group is a component of a reporting unit, the remaining unallocated goodwill is assessed to determine if\nany triggering events have occurred in accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC 350). We assess the fair\nvalue of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period the disposal group remains classified as held for sale and report any\nsubsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial\ncarrying value of the disposal group.\nWe recognize a gain or loss on divestiture activity when we transfer control of the disposal group and when it is probable that we will collect\nsubstantially all of the related consideration.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment reporting: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280) (ASU\nNo. 2023-07), which requires improved reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses. This standard is effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025. Entities\nshould apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. While the company is continuing to\nanalyze the impact of the adoption on reportable segment disclosures, the standard will not impact the company's consolidated operating\nresults, financial condition, or cash flows.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-09: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) (ASU No. 2023-09),\nwhich requires additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for\nour fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2025. Entities should apply the guidance prospectively. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2023-\n09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n3. Credit Arrangements\nDebt\nThe following table summarizes our debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(in millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nAmended 2022 Term Facility, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.4\nmillion and $0.5 million, respectively $ 515.9 $ 608.9\nAmended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility — 15.0\n2.32% Senior Notes due October 26, 2030, net of unamortized debt issuance\ncosts of $1.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively 348.8 348.5\nTotal debt $ 864.7 $ 972.4\nCredit Agreement\nOn May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the company with a five-year multi-\ncurrency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to $1.1 billion, including a $650.0 million term loan and a $450.0 million revolving\ncredit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement\nwas amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other items,\neliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to $650.0 million each, raising the\ntotal borrowing capacity to $1.3 billion (Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and to update\nthe reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement\nleft the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended 2022 Credit\nAgreement was $515.9 million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of $650.0 million under the Amended 2022 Revolving\nCredit Facility.\nThe interest rate applicable to any loan under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement is, at the company's option, either: (i) the applicable Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00% and 1.48%, based on the company's\nconsolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 0.00% and 0.38%,\nbased on the company's consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe portions of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are included in other current and non-current\nassets, and the portion of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying\namount of the Amended 2022 Term Facility. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis to interest expense over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022\nTerm Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement.\nPrivate Placement Debt Offering\nOn October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.32% senior notes due October 26,\n2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds\nwere primarily used to repay a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the company's prior credit facility. Interest on the 2030 Notes is\npaid semi-annually on each October 30 and April 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date having\noccurred on April 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was $348.8\nmillion.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with Covenants\nEach of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including\nfinancial covenants, that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n(EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges and consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, which are evaluated on a quarterly\nbasis. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024.\n4. Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\n2024 Acquisitions\nWe did not make any acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024.\nGoodwill\nThe company has seven operating segments, which are presented as the following five reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics,\nPitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The company's operating segments also represent the\ncompany's reporting units to which goodwill is assigned. The company allocated goodwill by reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 350\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC 350). Under this reporting unit structure, the consolidated goodwill balance was allocated based on\neach reporting unit's relative fair value at January 1, 2021. The company used a market approach and assigned goodwill to the reporting units.\nThe following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024:\nMorningstar Total\nData and Morningstar Morningstar Morningstar Reportable Corporate and\n(in millions) Analytics PitchBook Wealth Credit Retirement Segments All Other Total\nBalance as of\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 605.5 $ 607.4 $ 94.2 $ 108.6 $ 93.5 $ 1,509.2 $ 69.6 $ 1,578.8\nDivestiture of\nCommodity and\nEnergy Data\nbusiness (See Note\n5) (3.9) — — — — (3.9) — (3.9)\nForeign currency\ntranslation 3.7 — 0.8 0.1 — 4.6 0.1 4.7\nBalance as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 605.3 $ 607.4 $ 95.0 $ 108.7 $ 93.5 $ 1,509.9 $ 69.7 $ 1,579.6\nChanges in the carrying amount of the company’s recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of\nforeign currency translations. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, the company does not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an\nimpairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we assess a number of qualitative\nfactors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying values.\nExamples of qualitative factors that we assess include macroeconomic conditions affecting our reporting units, financial performance of our\nreporting units, market and competitive factors related to our reporting units, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. The\nquantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for\nthe amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves\njudgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating\nmargins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, as well as revenue and earnings multiples of publicly traded companies whose services\nand markets are comparable.\nWe perform our annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter or when impairment indicators and triggering events are identified. The company\ndid not record any goodwill impairment in the first nine months of 2024.

Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue by Type: (1)\nLicense-based $ 408.8 $ 384.5 $ 1,210.7 $ 1,124.5\nAsset-based 83.8 71.5 245.5 204.1\nTransaction-based 76.8 59.5 227.9 171.3\nConsolidated revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2024, revenue from PitchBook media sales product was reclassified from license-based to transaction-based. Prior\nperiods have not been restated to reflect the updated classifications.\nLicense-based performance obligations are generally satisfied over time as the customer has access to the product or service during the term of\nthe subscription license and the level of service is consistent during the contract period. License-based agreements typically have a term of 1 to\n3 years and are accounted for as subscription services available to customers and not as a license under the accounting guidance.\n15\nTable of Contents\nAsset-based performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer receives continuous access to a service for the term of the\nagreement. Asset-based arrangements typically have a term of 1 to 3 years. Asset-based fees represent variable consideration, and the\ncustomer does not make separate purchasing decisions that result in additional performance obligations. Significant changes in the underlying\nfund assets and significant disruptions in the market are evaluated to determine whether estimates of earned asset-based fees need to be\nrevised for the current quarter. The timing of client asset reporting and the structure of certain contracts can result in a lag between market\nmovements and the impact on earned revenue. An estimate of variable consideration is included in the initial transaction price only to the extent\nit is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the revenue recognized will not occur. Estimates of asset-based fees are based on the\nmost recently completed quarter and, as a result, it is unlikely a significant reversal of revenue would occur.\nTransaction-based performance obligations are satisfied when the product or service is completed or delivered. Some transaction-based\nrevenue includes revenue from surveillance services, which is recognized over time, as the customer has access to the service during the\nsurveillance period.\nContract Liabilities\nOur contract liabilities represent deferred revenue. We record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of our\nperformance, including amounts which may be refundable. The contract liabilities balance as of September 30, 2024 had a net increase of $18.6\nmillion, primarily driven by cash payments received or payable in advance of satisfying our performance obligations. We recognized $453.6\nmillion of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2023.\nWe expect to recognize revenue related to our contract liabilities, including future billings, for the remainder of 2024 and subsequent years as\nfollows:\n(in millions) As of September 30, 2024\nRemainder of 2024 (October 1 through December 31) $ 364.9\n2025 721.0\n2026 201.6\n2027 41.4\n2028 9.5\nThereafter 21.8\nTotal $ 1,360.2\nThe aggregate amount of revenue we expect to recognize for the remainder of 2024 and subsequent years is higher than our contract liability\nbalance of $562.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The difference represents the value of future obligations for signed contracts that have yet\nto be billed.\nThe table above does not include variable consideration for unsatisfied performance obligations related to certain of our license-based, asset-\nbased, and transaction-based contracts as of September 30, 2024. We are applying the optional exemption available under ASC Topic 606, as\nthe variable consideration relates to these unsatisfied performance obligations being fulfilled as a series. The performance obligations related to\nthese contracts are expected to be satisfied over the next 1 to 3 years as services are provided to the client. For license-based contracts, the\nconsideration received for services performed is based on the number of future users, which is not known until the services are performed. The\nvariable consideration for this revenue can be affected by the number of user licenses, which cannot be reasonably estimated. For asset-based\ncontracts, the consideration received for services performed is based on future asset values, which are not known until the services are\nperformed. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by changes in the underlying value of fund assets due to client\nredemptions, additional investments, or movements in the market. For transaction-based contracts, the consideration received for most Internet\nadvertising services performed is based on the number of impressions, which is not known until the impressions are created. The variable\nconsideration for this revenue can be affected by the timing and quantity of impressions in any given period and cannot be reasonably estimated.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the table above also does not include revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations related to certain of our\nlicense-based and transaction-based contracts with durations of one year or less since we are applying the optional exemption under ASC Topic\n606. For certain license-based contracts, the remaining performance obligation is expected to be less than one year based on the corresponding\nsubscription terms or the existence of cancellation terms that may be exercised causing the contract term to be less than one year from\nSeptember 30, 2024. For transaction-based contracts, such as new credit rating issuances and Morningstar-sponsored conferences, the related\nperformance obligations are expected to be satisfied within the next 12 months.\nContract Assets\nOur contract assets represent accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses, and deferred commissions.\nThe following table summarizes our contract assets balance:\n(in millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nAccounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses $ 328.4 $ 343.9\nDeferred commissions 68.4 71.2\nTotal contract assets $ 396.8 $ 415.1\n8. Segment and Geographical Area Information\nSegment Information\nOur segments are generally organized around the company's products offerings. The company concluded that it has seven operating segments\nwhich are presented as the following five reportable segments:\n• Morningstar Data and Analytics\n• PitchBook\n• Morningstar Wealth\n• Morningstar Credit\n• Morningstar Retirement\nThe operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting\nthresholds and have been combined and presented as part of Corporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and All\nOther provides a reconciliation between revenue from our total reportable segments and consolidated revenue amounts.\nMorningstar Data and Analytics provides investors comprehensive data, research and insights, and investment analysis to empower investment\ndecision-making. Morningstar Data and Analytics includes product areas such as Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor\nWorkstation.\nPitchBook provides investors with access to a broad collection of data and research covering the private capital markets, including venture\ncapital, private equity, private credit and bank loans, and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. Investors can also access Morningstar's data\nand research on public equities.\nMorningstar Wealth brings together our model portfolios and wealth platform; practice and portfolio management software for registered\ninvestment advisers; data aggregation and enrichment capabilities; and our individual investor platform.

Its offerings include managed retirement\naccounts, fiduciary services, Morningstar Lifetime Allocation funds, and custom models.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFASB ASC 280 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an\nenterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), in\ndeciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The company's chief executive officer, who is considered to be its CODM, reviews\nfinancial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.\nThe CODM allocates resources and assesses performance of segments based on segment revenue as well as Adjusted Operating Income.\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income excludes intangible amortization, M&A-related expenses (related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture\nactivity including severance and earn-outs), and items related to the significant reduction and prior shift of the company's operations in China,\nsuch as severance and personnel expenses, transformation costs, and asset impairment costs. The CODM does not consider these items for\nthe purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or to assess segment performance. Although the amounts are\nexcluded from segment Adjusted Operating Income, they are included in reported consolidated operating income and are included in the\nreconciliation to consolidated results. Expenses presented as part of the company's segments include both direct costs and allocations of shared\ncosts. Shared costs include technology, investment research, sales, facilities, and marketing. These allocations are based on estimated\nutilization of shared resources and other factors. Adjusted Operating Income is the reported measure that the company believes is most\nconsistent with those used in measuring the corresponding amount in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a segment basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment\nrevenues; therefore, there is none to be reported.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present information about the company’s reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements. Prior period segment information is presented on a comparable basis to the basis on which current period segment information is\npresented and reviewed by the CODM.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nMorningstar Data and Analytics $ 198.5 $ 188.7 $ 592.1 $ 554.5\nPitchBook 156.6 139.6 455.9 407.5\nMorningstar Wealth 61.8 58.0 183.4 168.7\nMorningstar Credit 70.9 52.9 208.8 153.9\nMorningstar Retirement 31.8 27.7 93.5 80.3\nTotal Reportable Segments $ 519.6 $ 466.9 $ 1,533.7 $ 1,364.9\nCorporate and All Other (1) 49.8 48.6 150.4 135.0\nTotal Revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss):\nMorningstar Data and Analytics $ 91.4 $ 88.4 $ 269.9 $ 249.4\nPitchBook 50.4 39.1 137.7 106.7\nMorningstar Wealth (0.7) (8.2) (8.5) (35.1)\nMorningstar Credit 15.2 2.8 55.4 3.8\nMorningstar Retirement 16.9 14.7 48.4 39.3\nTotal Reportable Segments $ 173.2 $ 136.8 $ 502.9 $ 364.1\nLess reconciling items to Operating Income:\nCorporate and All Other (2) $ (42.9) $ (44.8) $ (130.8) $ (150.6)\nIntangible amortization expense (3) (14.7) (17.7) (49.9) (52.9)\nM&A-related expenses (4) (0.1) (1.7) (5.6) (8.9)\nSeverance and personnel expenses (5) — (1.3) — (5.4)\nTransformation costs (5) — (0.6) — (7.0)\nAsset impairment costs (5) — (0.7) — (3.1)\nOperating Income 115.5 70.0 316.6 136.2\nNon-operating expense, net 36.4 (12.6) 11.8 (45.0)\nEquity in investments of unconsolidated entities (2.6) (1.6) (5.3) (4.7)\nIncome before income taxes $ 149.3 $ 55.8 $ 323.1 $ 86.5\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Corporate and All Other provides a reconciliation between revenue from our Total Reportable Segments and consolidated revenue amounts. Corporate and\nAll Other includes Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes as sources of revenues. Revenue from Morningstar Sustainalytics was $27.9 million and\n$31.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $87.9 million and $87.8 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During first\nnine months of 2024 and 2023, unallocated corporate expenses were $130.4 million and $111.4 million, respectively. Unallocated corporate expenses include\nfinance, human resources, legal, marketing, and other management-related costs that are not considered when segment performance is evaluated.\n(3) Excludes finance lease amortization expense of $0.1 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$0.5 million and $1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(4) Reflects non-recurring expenses related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including pre-deal due diligence, transaction costs, severance, and\npost-close integration costs.\n(5) Reflects costs associated with the significant reduction of the company's operations in Shenzhen, China and the shift of work related to its global business\nfunctions to other Morningstar locations.\nSeverance and personnel expenses include severance charges, incentive payments related to early signing of severance agreements, transition bonuses, and\nstock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of RSU and MSU awards. In addition, the reversal of accrued sabbatical liabilities is included in this\ncategory.\nTransformation costs include professional fees and the temporary duplication of headcount. As the company hired replacement roles in other markets and\nshifted capabilities, it employed certain Shenzhen-based staff through the transition period, which resulted in elevated compensation costs on a temporary basis.\nAsset impairment costs include the write-off or accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in the Shenzhen, China office that were not redeployed, in addition to\nlease abandonment costs as the company downsized its office space prior to the lease termination date.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present segment revenue disaggregated by revenue type:\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nMorningstar Total\nData and Morningstar Morningstar Morningstar Reportable Corporate and\n(in millions) Analytics PitchBook Wealth Credit Retirement Segments All Other (6) Total\nRevenue by Type: (7)\nLicense-based $ 198.5 $ 154.7 $ 20.1 $ 4.3 $ 0.4 $ 378.0 $ 30.8 $ 408.8\nAsset-based — — 35.5 — 31.4 66.9 16.9 83.8\nTransaction-based — 1.9 6.2 66.6 — 74.7 2.1 76.8\nTotal $ 198.5 $ 156.6 $ 61.8 $ 70.9 $ 31.8 $ 519.6 $ 49.8 $ 569.4\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nMorningstar Total\nData and Morningstar Morningstar Morningstar Reportable Corporate and\n(in millions) Analytics PitchBook Wealth Credit Retirement Segments All Other (6) Total\nRevenue by Type: (7)\nLicense-based $ 590.9 $ 450.4 $ 60.5 $ 12.2 $ 1.4 $ 1,115.4 $ 95.3 $ 1,210.7\nAsset-based — — 104.9 — 92.1 197.0 48.5 245.5\nTransaction-based 1.2 5.5 18.0 196.6 — 221.3 6.6 227.9\nTotal $ 592.1 $ 455.9 $ 183.4 $ 208.8 $ 93.5 $ 1,533.7 $ 150.4 $ 1,684.1\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nMorningstar Total\nData and Morningstar Morningstar Morningstar Reportable Corporate and\nAnalytics PitchBook Wealth Credit Retirement Segments All Other (6) Total\nRevenue by Type: (7)\nLicense-based $ 188.7 $ 139.6 $ 20.2 $ 3.0 $ 0.5 $ 352.0 $ 32.5 $ 384.5\nAsset-based — — 31.2 — 27.2 58.4 13.1 71.5\nTransaction-based — — 6.6 49.9 — 56.5 3.0 59.5\nTotal $ 188.7 $ 139.6 $ 58.0 $ 52.9 $ 27.7 $ 466.9 $ 48.6 $ 515.5\nNine months ended September 30, 2023\nMorningstar Total\nData and Morningstar Morningstar Morningstar Reportable Corporate and\n(in millions) Analytics PitchBook Wealth Credit Retirement Segments All Other (6) Total\nRevenue by Type: (7)\nLicense-based $ 553.1 $ 407.5 $ 60.6 $ 8.7 $ 1.4 $ 1,031.3 $ 93.2 $ 1,124.5\nAsset-based — — 90.2 — 78.7 168.9 35.2 204.1\nTransaction-based 1.4 — 17.9 145.2 0.2 164.7 6.6 171.3\nTotal $ 554.5 $ 407.5 $ 168.7 $ 153.9 $ 80.3 $ 1,364.9 $ 135.0 $ 1,499.9\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n(6) Corporate and All Other provides a reconciliation between revenue from our Total Reportable Segments and consolidated revenue amounts.

Fair Value Measurements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment balances totaled $48.8 million and $51.1 million, respectively. We classify\nour investments into two categories: equity investments and debt securities. We further classify our debt securities into available-for-sale, held-\nto-maturity, and trading securities. Our investment portfolio consists of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-\ntraded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include\nexchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider. As of September 30, 2024, all investments in our investment portfolio have\nvaluations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access, and, therefore, are\nclassified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize unrealized holding gains or losses within \"Other income (expense), net\" on our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\n10. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment in unconsolidated entities balance totaled $96.0 million and $100.2 million,\nrespectively. We have investments in both equity method investments and investments in equity securities with and without a readily\ndeterminable fair value.\nThe carrying amount of other investments in unconsolidated entities without a readily determinable fair value was $50.6 million and $49.9 million\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We did not record any material adjustments or impairment losses in the first\nnine months of 2024 or 2023.\nOn January 27, 2023, we entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement) with Morningstar Japan K.K. (now known as SBI\nGlobal Asset Management Co., Ltd. (Wealth Advisors)), and a Tender Offer Agreement (the Tender Offer Agreement) with SBI Global Asset\nManagement Co., Ltd. (now known as SBI Asset Management Group Co., Ltd. (SBI)).\nPursuant to the Termination Agreement, Wealth Advisors agreed to cease use of the Morningstar brand and Morningstar and Wealth Advisors\nagreed to terminate the License Agreement originally entered into in 1998. As consideration for the transaction, Morningstar agreed to pay\nWealth Advisors 8 billion Japanese yen upon the termination of the license agreement and the achievement of certain conditions related\nprimarily to the termination of the use of the Morningstar brand by Wealth Advisors’ customers.\nOn April 6, 2023, we made the first cash payment of 6 billion Japanese yen ($45.1 million) and on April 19, 2023, we made the second and final\ncash payment of 2 billion Japanese yen ($14.8 million), pursuant to the Termination Agreement. The expense related to the Termination\nAgreement is recorded within \"Expense from equity method transaction, net\" in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAs part of this transaction, pursuant to the Tender Offer Agreement, Morningstar agreed to tender up to 10 million shares in Wealth Advisors to\nSBI. The tender offer closed on February 28, 2023, and SBI purchased 8,040,600 shares of Wealth Advisors from Morningstar, resulting in net\nproceeds of $26.2 million and a pre-tax gain of $18.4 million. The pre-tax gain is recorded within \"Expense from equity method transaction, net\"\nin our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nImmediately following the tender offer, the company's ownership percentage in Wealth Advisors decreased to 13.2% from 22.1%, and as a\nresult, we no longer account for our investment in Wealth Advisors as an equity method investment. Each reporting period, we remeasure our\nremaining investment in Wealth Advisors, an equity security with a readily determinable value, at fair value and recognize unrealized holding\ngains or losses within \"Other income (expense), net\" on our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the first quarter of 2023, we recognized\nan unrealized holding gain of $31.2 million, which is recorded within \"Expense from equity method transaction, net\" in our Consolidated\nStatement of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n11. Leases\nWe lease office space and certain equipment under various operating and finance leases, with most of our lease portfolio consisting of operating\nleases for office space.\nWe determine whether an arrangement is, or includes, an embedded lease at contract inception. Operating lease assets and lease liabilities are\nrecognized at the commencement date and are initially measured using the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we also recognize a finance lease asset and finance\nlease liability at inception, with lease expense recognized as interest expense and amortization.\nA contract is or contains an embedded lease if the contract meets all the below criteria:\n• there is an identified asset;\n• we obtain substantially all the economic benefits of the asset; and\n• we have the right to direct the use of the asset.\nFor initial measurement of the present value of lease payments and for subsequent measurement of lease modifications, we are required to use\nthe rate implicit in the lease, if available. However, as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate,\nwhich is a collateralized rate. To apply the incremental borrowing rate, we used a portfolio approach and grouped leases based on similar lease\nterms in a manner whereby we reasonably expect that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.\nOur leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 11 years, which may include the option to extend the lease when it is\nreasonably certain we will exercise that option. We do not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale leaseback terms, or\nmaterial restrictive covenants.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term.\nOur operating lease expense for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11.2 million. Charges related to our\noperating leases that are variable and, therefore, not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities, were $4.8 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared with $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We made lease payments of $12.5\nmillion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $11.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOur operating lease expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $32.0 million, compared with $36.3 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Charges related to our operating leases that are variable and, therefore, not included in the measurement of the\nlease liabilities were $11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $13.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. We made lease payments of $34.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $34.2 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows our minimum future lease commitments due in each of the next five years and thereafter for operating leases:\nMinimum Future Lease Commitments (in millions) Operating Leases\nRemainder of 2024 (October 1 through December 31) $ 9.3\n2025 40.3\n2026 42.8\n2027 33.9\n2028 26.9\nThereafter 48.4\nTotal minimum lease commitments 201.6\nAdjustment for discount to present value 23.7\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 177.9\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for our operating leases:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 5.6\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.2 %\n12. Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nOur employees and our non-employee directors are eligible for awards under the Morningstar Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive\nPlan, which provides for a variety of stock-based awards, including stock options, RSUs, PSUs, MSUs, and restricted stock.\nThe following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense included in each of our operating expense categories:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ 6.5 $ 7.1 $ 18.1 $ 19.3\nSales and marketing 2.5 2.3 7.0 6.4\nGeneral and administrative 4.2 5.3 13.7 16.0\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 13.2 $ 14.7 $ 38.8 $ 41.7\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs, PSUs, and MSUs expected to\nvest was $79.6 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 29 months.\n25\nTable of Contents\n13. Income Taxes\nThe following table shows our effective tax rate for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome before income taxes and equity in investments of\nunconsolidated entities $ 151.9 $ 57.4 $ 328.4 $ 91.2\nEquity in investments of unconsolidated entities (2.6) (1.6) (5.3) (4.7)\nIncome before income taxes $ 149.3 $ 55.8 $ 323.1 $ 86.5\nIncome tax expense $ 29.6 $ 16.7 $ 70.1 $ 18.9\nEffective tax rate 19.8 % 29.9 % 21.7 % 21.8 %\nOur effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 19.8% and 21.7%, respectively, reflecting decreases of 10.1 and 0.1\npercentage points, respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior year. The decreases are primarily attributable to the book gain in\nexcess of taxable gain on the sale of our Commodity and Energy Data business in the third quarter of 2024.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to a two-pillar approach to global taxation\nfocusing on global profit allocation (Pillar One) and a global minimum tax rate (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the European Union member\nstates agreed to implement the OECD’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% under Pillar Two which became effective in January 2024.\nOther countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. This legislation represents a\nsignificant change in the international tax regime and could result in increases to our effective tax rate as a result of the imposition of minimum\ntaxes. Pillar Two did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. We are continuing to monitor\ndevelopments and administrative guidance in addition to evaluating the potential impact of Pillar Two on our consolidated financial statements for\nfuture periods.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe table below provides information concerning our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as\nwell as the effect these gross unrecognized tax benefits would have on our income tax expense, if they were recognized.\n(in millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefits $ 14.5 $ 13.0\nGross unrecognized tax benefits that would affect income tax expense $ 14.5 $ 13.0\nDecrease in income tax expense upon recognition of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits $ 14.2 $ 12.8\nOur Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These amounts include interest and\npenalties, less any associated tax benefits.\nLiabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits (in millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nCurrent liability $ 7.6 $ 6.2\nNon-current liability 9.0 8.3\nTotal liability for unrecognized tax benefits $ 16.6 $ 14.5\n26\nTable of Contents\nBecause we conduct business globally, we file income tax returns in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under\naudit by federal, state, and local tax authorities in the U.S. as well as tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. It is likely that the\nexamination phase of some of these federal, state, local, and non-U.S. audits will conclude in 2024. It is not possible to estimate the effect of\ncurrent audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.\nApproximately 73% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance as of September 30, 2024 was held by our operations outside of the\nUnited States. We generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. We believe that our\ncash balances and investments in the United States, along with cash generated from our U.S. operations, will be sufficient to meet our U.S.\noperating and cash needs for the foreseeable future, without requiring us to repatriate earnings from these foreign subsidiaries.\nCertain of our non-U.S. operations have incurred net operating losses (NOLs), which may become deductible to the extent these operations\nbecome profitable. For each of our operations, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to NOLs will be\nrealized. As part of this evaluation, we consider evidence such as tax planning strategies, historical operating results, forecasted taxable income,\nand recent financial performance. In the year that certain non-U.S. operations record a loss, we do not recognize a corresponding tax benefit,\nwhich increases our effective tax rate. Upon determining that it is more likely than not that the NOLs will be realized, we reduce the tax valuation\nallowances related to these NOLs, which results in a reduction to our income tax expense and our effective tax rate in that period.\n14. Contingencies\nWe record accrued liabilities for litigation, regulatory, and other business matters when those matters represent loss contingencies that are both\nprobable and estimable. In these cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Unless a loss contingency is both\nprobable and estimable, we do not establish an accrued liability. As litigation, regulatory, or other business matters develop, we evaluate on an\nongoing basis whether such matters present a loss contingency that is probable and estimable.\nData Audits and Reviews\nIn our global data business, we include in our products, or directly redistribute to our customers, data and information licensed from third-party\nvendors. Our compliance with the terms of these licenses is reviewed internally and is also subject to audit by the third-party vendors. At any\ngiven time, we may be undergoing several such internal reviews and third-party vendor audits, and the results and findings may indicate that we\nmay be required to make a payment for prior data usage. Due to a lack of available information and data, as well as potential variations of any\naudit or internal review findings, we generally are not able to reasonably estimate a possible loss, or range of losses, for these matters. In\nsituations where more information or specific areas subject to audit are available, we may be able to estimate a potential range of losses. While\nwe cannot predict the outcome of these processes, we do not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating\nresults, or financial position.\nRatings and Regulatory Matters\nOur ratings and related research activities, including credit ratings, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings, managed investment,\nand equity ratings, are or may in the future become subject to regulation or increased scrutiny from executive, legislative, regulatory, and private\nparties. As a result, those activities may be subject to governmental, regulatory, and legislative investigations, regulatory examinations in the\nordinary course of business, subpoenas, and other forms of legal process, which may lead to claims and litigation that are based on these\nratings and related research activities. Our regulated businesses are generally subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations, and\ninvestigations by regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines,\npenalties, disgorgement, or restrictions on business activities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular investigation or\nproceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or\nfinancial position.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOther Matters\nWe are involved from time to time in commercial disputes and legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business. While it is\ndifficult to predict the outcome of any particular dispute or proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.\n15. Share Repurchase Program\nOn December 6, 2022, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0\nmillion in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2023. This authorization replaced the then-existing share\nrepurchase program and expires on December 31, 2025. Under this authorization, we may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing\nmarket prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under the share repurchase program. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have $498.6 million available for future repurchases under the current share repurchase program.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe discussion included in this section, as well as other under sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report), contains\nforward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our\ncurrent expectations about future events or future financial performance. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to\ndifferent degrees, uncertain, and often contain words such as “consider,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “designed to,” “maintain,” “may,”\n“objective,” “ongoing,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “continue,” “strategy,” “strive,”\n“will,” “would,” \"determine,\" \"evaluate,\" or the negative thereof, and similar expressions. These statements involve known and unknown risks and\nuncertainties that may cause the events we discuss not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expect. For us, these risks and\nuncertainties include, among others:\n• failing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation;\n• failure to prevent and/or mitigate cybersecurity events and the failure to protect confidential information, including personal\ninformation about individuals;\n• compliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our credit ratings operations, investment advisory, ESG,\nand index businesses;\n• failing to innovate our product and service offerings or anticipate our clients’ changing needs;\n• the impact of artificial intelligence and related new technologies on our business, legal, and regulatory exposure profile and\nreputation;\n• failure to detect errors in our products or failure of our products to perform properly due to defects, malfunctions, or similar\nproblems;\n• failing to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees;\n• prolonged volatility or downturns affecting the financial sector, global financial markets, and the global economy and its effect on\nour revenue from asset-based fees and credit ratings business;\n• failing to scale our operations and increase productivity in order to implement our business plans and strategies;\n• liability for any losses that result from errors in our automated advisory tools or errors in the use of the information and data we\ncollect;\n• inadequacy of our operational risk management, business continuity programs, and insurance coverage in the event of a\nmaterial disruptive event;\n• failing to close, or achieve the anticipated economic or other benefits of, a strategic transaction on a timely basis or at all;\n• failing to efficiently integrate and leverage acquisitions and other investments, which may not realize the expected business or\nfinancial benefits, to produce the results we anticipate;\n• failing to maintain growth across our businesses in today's fragmented geopolitical, regulatory, and cultural world;\n• liability relating to the information and data we collect, store, use, create, and distribute or the reports that we publish or are\nproduced by our software products;\n• the potential adverse effect of our indebtedness on our cash flows and financial and operational flexibility;\n• challenges in accounting for tax complexities in the global jurisdictions we operate in could materially affect our tax obligations\nand tax rates; and\n• failing to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of intellectual property infringement against us.\n29\nTable of Contents\nA more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report) as supplemented by our recent\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, our actual future results and other future events may vary\nsignificantly from what we expect. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events,\nor otherwise, except as may be required by law. You are, however, advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects, and\nabout new or additional risks, uncertainties, and assumptions in our filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons, which are often accompanied by words such as “increase,” “decrease,” “grew,” “declined,” “was up,” “was\ndown,” “was flat,” or “was similar” refer to a comparison with the same period in the previous year unless otherwise stated.\nUnderstanding our company\nOur Business\nOur mission is to empower investor success. The investing ecosystem is complex, and navigating it with confidence requires a trusted,\nindependent voice. We deliver our perspective to institutions, advisors, and individuals with a single-minded purpose: to empower investors with\nthe conviction that they can make better-informed decisions and realize success on their own terms.\nOur strategy is to deliver insights and experiences that are essential to the investor workflow. Proprietary data sets, meaningful analytics,\nindependent research, and effective investment strategies are at the core of the powerful digital solutions that investors across our client\nsegments rely on. We have a keen focus on innovation across data, research, product, and delivery so that we can effectively cater to the\nevolving needs and expectations of investors globally.\nThe company has seven operating segments which are presented as the following five reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics,\nPitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and\nMorningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of\nCorporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Prior period segment information is presented on a comparable basis to the basis on\nwhich current period segment information is presented and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM). For additional information\nabout our segment reporting, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to reviewing revenue by our reportable segments, we review revenue by type. We leverage our proprietary data and research to sell\nproducts and services across our portfolio that generate revenue in three primary ways:\nLicense-based: The majority of our research, data, and proprietary platforms are accessed via subscription services that grant access on either a\nper user or enterprise-basis for a specified period of time.\nAsset-based: We charge basis points and other fees for assets under management (AUM) or advisement (AUMA).\nTransaction-based: Revenue is transactional, or one-time, in nature, compared with the recurring revenue streams represented by our license\nand asset-based products.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThree and Nine Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated Results\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\nKey Metrics (in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nConsolidated revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 10.5 % $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9 12.3 %\nOperating income 115.5 70.0 65.0 % 316.6 136.2 132.5 %\nOperating margin 20.3 % 13.6 % 6.7 pp 18.8 % 9.1 % 9.7 pp\nCash provided by operating activities $ 191.9 $ 130.7 46.8 % $ 438.2 $ 178.6 145.4 %\nCapital expenditures (36.1) (29.3) 23.2 % (102.1) (89.1) 14.6 %\nFree cash flow $ 155.8 $ 101.4 53.6 % $ 336.1 $ 89.5 275.5 %\nCash provided by (used for) investing\nactivities $ 14.1 $ (21.3) NMF $ (45.4) $ (49.1) (7.5)%\nCash used for financing activities $ (60.2) $ (120.1) (49.9)% $ (185.3) $ (175.0) 5.9 %\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\npp — percentage points\nNMF — not meaningful\nSupplemental Information\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we\nuse the following non-GAAP measures:\n• consolidated revenue, excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of new accounting standards or revisions to accounting practices\n(accounting changes), and the effect of foreign currency translations (organic revenue);\n• consolidated operating income, excluding intangible amortization expense, all merger and acquisition- related expenses (related to\nmerger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including severance and earn-outs (M&A-related expenses)), and expenses related to the\nsignificant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China (adjusted operating income);\n• consolidated operating margin, excluding intangible amortization expense, all M&A-related expenses, and expenses related to the\nsignificant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China (adjusted operating margin); and\n• cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures (free cash flow).\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be considered an\nalternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP.\nWe present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses\nthis measure to evaluate the performance of our business. We exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth\ncalculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior year period for which\nthere is no comparable revenue in the current period.\nWe present adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because we believe they better reflect period-over-period comparisons\nand improve overall understanding of the underlying performance of the business absent the impact of M&A and the shift of the company's\noperations in China.\nWe present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after capital\nexpenditures. Our management team uses free cash flow as a metric to evaluate the health of our business. Free cash flow should not be\nconsidered an alternative to any measure required to be reported under GAAP (such as cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and\nfinancing activities).\n31\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Revenue\nRevenue by type (1) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nMorningstar Data and Analytics\nLicense-based $ 198.5 $ 188.7 5.2 % $ 590.9 $ 553.1 6.8 %\nAsset-based — — — % — — — %\nTransaction-based — — — % 1.2 1.4 (14.3)%\nMorningstar Data and Analytics total $ 198.5 $ 188.7 5.2 % $ 592.1 $ 554.5 6.8 %\nPitchBook\nLicense-based $ 154.7 $ 139.6 10.8 % $ 450.4 $ 407.5 10.5 %\nAsset-based — — — % — — — %\nTransaction-based 1.9 — NMF 5.5 — NMF\nPitchBook total $ 156.6 $ 139.6 12.2 % $ 455.9 $ 407.5 11.9 %\nMorningstar Wealth\nLicense-based $ 20.1 $ 20.2 (0.5)% $ 60.5 $ 60.6 (0.2)%\nAsset-based 35.5 31.2 13.8 % 104.9 90.2 16.3 %\nTransaction-based 6.2 6.6 (6.1)% 18.0 17.9 0.6 %\nMorningstar Wealth total $ 61.8 $ 58.0 6.6 % $ 183.4 $ 168.7 8.7 %\nMorningstar Credit\nLicense-based $ 4.3 $ 3.0 43.3 % $ 12.2 $ 8.7 40.2 %\nAsset-based — — — % — — — %\nTransaction-based 66.6 49.9 33.5 % 196.6 145.2 35.4 %\nMorningstar Credit total $ 70.9 $ 52.9 34.0 % $ 208.8 $ 153.9 35.7 %\nMorningstar Retirement\nLicense-based $ 0.4 $ 0.5 (20.0)% $ 1.4 $ 1.4 — %\nAsset-based 31.4 27.2 15.4 % 92.1 78.7 17.0 %\nTransaction-based — — — % — 0.2 NMF\nMorningstar Retirement total $ 31.8 $ 27.7 14.8 % $ 93.5 $ 80.3 16.4 %\nCorporate and All Other (2)\nLicense-based $ 30.8 $ 32.5 (5.2)% $ 95.3 $ 93.2 2.3 %\nAsset-based 16.9 13.1 29.0 % 48.5 35.2 37.8 %\nTransaction-based 2.1 3.0 (30.0)% 6.6 6.6 — %\nCorporate and All Other total $ 49.8 $ 48.6 2.5 % $ 150.4 $ 135.0 11.4 %\nLicense-based $ 408.8 $ 384.5 6.3 % $ 1,210.7 $ 1,124.5 7.7 %\nAsset-based 83.8 71.5 17.2 % 245.5 204.1 20.3 %\nTransaction-based 76.8 59.5 29.1 % 227.9 171.3 33.0 %\nConsolidated revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 10.5 % $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9 12.3 %\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2024, revenue from PitchBook's media sales product was reclassified from license-based to transaction-based.\nPrior periods have not been restated to reflect the updated classifications.\n(2) Corporate and All Other provides a reconciliation between revenue from our reportable segments and consolidated revenue.

On an organic basis, transaction-based revenue\nincreased 30.3% primarily driven by Morningstar Credit revenue.\nOrganic Revenue\nOrganic revenue (revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, the adoption of new accounting standards or revisions to accounting practices\n(accounting changes), and the effect of foreign currency translations) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the\nacquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period. Beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, we will exclude revenue related to our Commodity and Energy Data business, which we divested in the third quarter\nof 2024, from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the divestiture.\nThe table below reconciles reported consolidated revenue with organic revenue:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nConsolidated revenue $ 569.4 $ 515.5 10.5 % $ 1,684.1 $ 1,499.9 12.3 %\nLess: acquisitions — — — % — — — %\nLess: accounting changes — — — % — — — %\nEffect of foreign currency translations (1.6) — NMF (1.4) — NMF\nOrganic revenue $ 567.8 $ 515.5 10.1 % $ 1,682.7 $ 1,499.9 12.2 %\nOrganic revenue increased 10.1% in the third quarter, driven by organic growth in Morningstar Credit, PitchBook, and Morningstar Data and\nAnalytics.

Foreign\ncurrency translations also had an unfavorable $1.2 million and $0.8 million impact on operating expense during the third quarter of 2024 and the\nfirst nine months of 2024, respectively.\nIncreases in compensation expense and technology infrastructure costs were mostly offset by decreases in severance expense and amortization\nexpense during the third quarter of 2024 and the impact of SEC settlement-related expenses for DBRS, Inc. in the third quarter of 2023.\nCompensation expense (which primarily consists of salaries, bonuses, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased $16.2 million in the\nthird quarter of 2024. These higher costs primarily reflect an increase in bonus expense as a result of increased accruals due to favorable\nperformance compared to targets in certain parts of the business.\n34\nTable of Contents\nTechnology infrastructure costs consisting of expenses related to SaaS-based software subscriptions and cloud computing of $4.0 million were\nalso an operating expense driver during the third quarter of 2024 due to the company's investment in and renewal of various SaaS-based\nplatforms across the business.\nDepreciation expense increased $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven mainly by higher levels of capitalized software development over\nthe past several years.\nOn September 29, 2023, DBRS, Inc. entered into two settlements with the SEC requiring DBRS, Inc. to pay an aggregate of $8.0 million in civil\nmonetary penalties. The DBRS, Inc. SEC settlements resulted in a $6.0 million expense for the third quarter of 2023, bringing the total expense\nto $8.0 million for the first nine months of 2023.\nSeverance expense decreased $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. We recorded $5.0 million of\nseverance expense during the third quarter of 2023 related to targeted reorganizations and headcount reductions in certain parts of the\nbusiness, including Morningstar Sustainalytics, Morningstar Wealth, and Morningstar Credit.\nIntangible amortization expense decreased $3.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period as certain intangible\nassets from some of our earlier acquisitions became fully amortized.\nIncreases in compensation expense, technology infrastructure costs, and depreciation expense were mostly offset by decreases in professional\nfees and facilities-related expenses during the first nine months of 2024 and the impact of DBRS, Inc. SEC settlement-related expenses during\nthe first nine months of 2023.\nCompensation expense, technology infrastructure costs, and depreciation expense increased $23.7 million, $9.4 million, and $7.1 million,\nrespectively, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.\nProfessional fees and facilities-related expenses decreased $9.3 million and $7.0 million, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024\ncompared with the prior year period. Professional fees declined due to lower expenses for third-party resources supporting M&A integration-\nrelated activity. Facilities-related expenses decreased partially due to reduction of office space in certain geographies.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily\non human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who develop our products and deliver our services.\nWe include compensation expense for approximately 76% of our employees in this category.\nCost of revenue increased $19.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $25.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. Higher compensation\nexpense of $13.1 million and $17.3 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, were the primarily drivers of the\nincrease due to the factors noted above. Higher technology infrastructure costs also increased $2.1 million and $5.5 million during the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, due to the same factors noted above.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and was relatively flat during the first nine months of 2024.\nAdvertising and marketing costs increased $1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 due to higher marketing campaign and conference\nexpense. Professional fees also increased $1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. A decline in SEC-related settlement expense and\nprofessional fees of $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, were the largest contributors to the decline during the quarter due to the factors\nnoted above.\n35\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $25.6 million in the first nine months of 2024. A decline in professional fees and 2023 DBRS, Inc.\nSEC-related settlement expenses of $13.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively, were the largest contributors to the decline due to the factors\nnoted above. Facilities-related expenses also declined $6.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 due to the factors noted above. These\ndecreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense primarily due to an increase in bonus expense and company-sponsored\nbenefits.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation expense increased $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $7.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, driven mainly by higher\nlevels of capitalized software development over the past several years.\nIntangible amortization expense decreased $3.0 million during both the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 as certain\nintangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions became fully amortized.\nConsolidated Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOperating income $ 115.5 $ 70.0 65.0 % $ 316.6 $ 136.2 132.5 %\n% of revenue 20.3 % 13.6 % 6.7 pp 18.8 % 9.1 % 9.7 pp\nConsolidated operating income increased $45.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase in revenue of $53.9 million and an\nincrease in operating expense of $8.4 million.

PitchBook clients who were not previously LCD clients drove the majority of the increase in licensed users, although\ngrowth continued to reflect the impact of legacy LCD clients who have moved to the PitchBook platform and are now reflected in licensed user\ncounts. PitchBook platform growth drivers were consistent with recent quarters and reflected strength in PitchBook's core investor and advisor\nclient segments, including venture capital, private equity, and investment banks.

The increase in Morningstar Indexes revenue was primarily driven by higher investable\nproduct revenue as market performance and net inflows over the trailing 12 months increased asset value linked to Morningstar Indexes by\n37.5% to $228.2 billion.\nMorningstar Indexes contributed $15.3 million to Corporate and All Other revenue growth with revenue increasing 32.4%, or 32.3%, on an\norganic basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n41\nTable of Contents\nMorningstar Sustainalytics revenues declined compared to the prior period for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decline was\nlargely driven by lower revenues for ESG Risk Ratings and other licensed-based products, reflecting increased cancellations due to vendor\nconsolidation and softness in parts of the retail asset management and wealth client segments. Revenue was also negatively impacted by\nfurther streamlining of licensed-ratings offerings.\nMorningstar Sustainalytics contributed $0.5 million to Corporate and All Other revenue growth with revenue increasing 0.6%, or 0.4%, on an\norganic basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNon-operating income (expense), net, Equity in investments of unconsolidated entities, and Effective tax rate and income tax expense\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 3.2 $ 3.0 $ 8.5 $ 5.9\nInterest expense (12.1) (15.8) (39.2) (46.1)\nRealized gain on sale of investments, reclassified from\nother comprehensive income 0.5 1.9 3.3 2.4\nGain on sale of business 45.3 — 45.3 —\nExpense from equity method transaction, net — — — (11.8)\nOther income (expense), net (0.5) (1.7) (6.1) 4.6\nNon-operating income (expense), net $ 36.4 $ (12.6) $ 11.8 $ (45.0)\nInterest income reflects interest from our investment portfolio.

The decreases are primarily attributable the book gain in\nexcess of taxable gain on the sale of our Commodity and Energy Data business in the third quarter of 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $601.7 million, compared with $389.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, an increase of $212.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash. In the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was\n$438.2 million compared to $178.6 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow increased to $336.1 million compared to $89.5 million in the\nprior-year period. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were driven by higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. We made\nannual bonus payments of $123.9 million during the first quarter of 2024 compared with $98.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our Amended 2022 Credit Facility, will\nbe sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and\nliquidity position. We hold our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments and maintain a conservative investment policy. We invest most\nof our investment balance in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model\nportfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is\nan index provider.\nApproximately 73% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance as of September 30, 2024 was held by our operations outside the\nUnited States, down from 76% as of December 31, 2023. We generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be\npermanently reinvested.\nWe intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future\ngrowth.\nCredit Agreement\nOn May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the Company with a five-year\nmulti-currency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to $1.1 billion, including a $650.0 million term loan and a $450.0 million\nrevolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit\nAgreement was amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other\nitems, eliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to $650.0 million each,\nraising the total borrowing capacity to $1.3 billion (Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and\nto update the reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit\nAgreement left the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended\n2022 Credit Agreement was $515.9 million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of $650.0 million under the Amended 2022\nRevolving Credit Facility.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe interest rate applicable to any loan under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement is, at the company's option, either: (i) the applicable Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00% and 1.48%, based on the company's\nconsolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 0.00% and 0.38%,\nbased on the company's consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe portions of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are included in other current and non-current\nassets, and the portion of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying\namount of the Amended 2022 Term Facility. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis to interest expense over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022\nTerm Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement.\nPrivate Placement Debt Offering\nOn October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.32% senior notes due October 26,\n2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds\nwere primarily used to repay a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the company's prior credit facility. Interest on the 2030 Notes is\npaid semi-annually on each October 30 and April 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date having\noccurred on April 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was $348.8\nmillion.\nCompliance with Covenants\nEach of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including\nfinancial covenants, that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n(EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges and consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, which are evaluated on a quarterly\nbasis. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, with consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated\nEBITDA calculated at approximately 1.2x.\nDividend\nIn September 2024, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.405 per share, or $17.4 million, payable on October 31,\n2024 to shareholders of record as of October 4, 2024. We paid $52.0 million in dividends in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn December 2022, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million\nin shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2023. This authorization expires on December 31, 2025. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under the share repurchase program. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 we have $498.6 million available for future repurchases under the current share repurchase program.\nOther\nWe expect to continue making capital expenditures in the remainder of 2024, primarily for computer hardware and software provided by third\nparties, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.\n44\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Free Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures, and it is considered a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nCash provided by operating activities $ 191.9 $ 130.7 46.8 % $ 438.2 $ 178.6 145.4 %\nCapital expenditures (36.1) (29.3) 23.2 % (102.1) (89.1) 14.6 %\nFree cash flow $ 155.8 $ 101.4 53.6 % $ 336.1 $ 89.5 275.5 %\nWe generated free cash flow of $155.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $101.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change\nreflects a $61.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior-year\nperiod. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the company paid $16.1 million of severance and other costs related to the significant reduction and shift of the\nCompany's operations in China. Excluding the impact of these severance payments and related costs, free cash flow would have been $117.5\nmillion.\nFor the first nine months of 2024, we had free cash flow of $336.1 million compared with $89.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The\nchange reflects a $259.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in cash\nflow from operations was primarily driven by higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures increased primarily\ndue to investment in our product development efforts across our key product areas.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the company made its final $50.0 million payment related to the acquisition of LCD, of which $4.5 million is\nreflected in operating cash flows and $45.5 million is reflected in financing cash flows. In the second quarter of 2023, the company made the final\ncash payments of $59.9 million related to the Termination Agreement, which were reflected in operating cash flows. Excluding the $4.5 million\nLCD payment within operating cash flow, payments related to the Termination Agreement of $59.9 million, and $26.2 million of severance and\nother related costs paid for the shift of the company's operations in China, which together totaled $90.6 million, free cash flow would have been\n$180.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, included in our Annual Report. We also discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report and in Note 2 of the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements contained in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. There have not been any material changes during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 to the methodologies applied by management for critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report.\n45\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nOur investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection.\nThese accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model\nportfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is\nan index provider. As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was $601.7 million. Based on our estimates,\na 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nWe are subject to risk from fluctuations in the interest rates related to a portion of our long-term debt. The interest rates are based upon the\napplicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate plus an applicable margin for such loans or the lender's base rate plus an applicable\nmargin for such loans. On an annualized basis, we estimate a 100 basis-point change in the SOFR rate would have a $5.2 million impact on our\ninterest expense based on our outstanding principal balance and SOFR rates at September 30, 2024.\nWe are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the United States. We do not currently have any\npositions in derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency risk.\nThe table below shows our exposure to foreign currency denominated revenue and operating income for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024:\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nAustralian Other Foreign\n(in millions, except foreign currency rates) Dollar British Pound Canadian Dollar Euro Currencies\nCurrency rate in U.S. dollars as of September 30, 2024 0.6926 1.3389 0.7399 1.1162 n/a\nPercentage of revenue 2.7 % 7.3 % 6.1 % 6.5 % 5.4 %\nPercentage of operating income (loss) 5.7 % (5.9)% 4.7 % 9.1 % (12.0)%\nEstimated effect of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on\nrevenue $ (4.8) $ (12.9) $ (10.4) $ (11.2) $ (9.4)\nEstimated effect of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on\noperating income (loss) $ (1.9) $ 2.0 $ (1.5) $ (2.9) $ 3.7\nThe table below shows our net investment exposure to foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAustralian Canadian Other Foreign\n(in millions) Dollar British Pound Dollar Euro Currencies\nAssets, net of unconsolidated entities $ 70.9 $ 313.0 $ 250.6 $ 246.7 $ 223.0\nLess: liabilities (32.3) (86.3) (122.3) (150.0) 21.6\nNet currency position $ 38.6 $ 226.7 $ 128.3 $ 96.7 $ 244.6\nEstimated effect of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on equity $ (3.9) $ (22.7) $ (12.8) $ (9.7) $ (24.5)\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation and Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed\nto reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer\nconcluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable\nassurance level. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the\nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been or would be detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple\nerror or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of\nfuture events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over\ntime, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nPART 2. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

The business was included in the Morningstar Data and Analytics segment but was not included in any of the key product areas that we separately report revenue for (including Morningstar Data). Note that the Commodity and Energy Data business was not material relative to the broader Data and Analytics segment. We will be excluding associated revenue from organic revenue growth calculations starting in Q4 2024 and expect that the divestiture will be slightly dilutive to Data and Analytics margins. While we do not share transaction multiples, we believe we achieved a positive result and unlocked value for a non-core business.\n\n[View all Investor Q&A](/investor-relations/investor-qa/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [Ask a Question](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/investor-qa/ask-a-question/default.aspx)\n  * [Interactive Financials](https://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=MORN&Exchange=NASDAQGS)\n  * [Ethics Hotline](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/governance/ethics-hotline/default.aspx)\n  * [Email Alerts](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/resources/email-alerts/default.aspx)\n  * [Contacts](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/resources/contacts/default.aspx)\n\n\n\nFollow Morningstar\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/MorningstarInc)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/MorningstarInc)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/morningstar)\n  * [](https://www.instagram.com/morningstarinc/)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/user/morningstar)\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Morningstar, Inc.

Our standing Board committees, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NCGC”), are led by and composed entirely of independent directors. \n\nOur independent directors regularly meet in executive session, with no management directors or other members of management present. The Chair of the NCGC works closely with the Chairman to set the agenda for each Board meeting and provides feedback on the areas of focus and form of materials presented to the Board. The Chair of the NCGC also serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors.\n\nWe monitor and assess the independence of each of our directors and director nominees under Nasdaq listing rules, which contain very similar independence criteria as the International Corporate Governance Network, as well as applicable regulations and company policies. In addition, in order for a director to be considered independent, our Board makes an affirmative determination annually as to whether each director has a direct or indirect relationship with Morningstar that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We also evaluate our Board members’ skills, qualifications, and experiences annually and evaluate ongoing board refreshment to support the future success of our business and represent shareholder interests.\n\n[View all Investor Q&A](/investor-relations/investor-qa/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [Ask a Question](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/investor-qa/ask-a-question/default.aspx)\n  * [Interactive Financials](https://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=MORN&Exchange=NASDAQGS)\n  * [Ethics Hotline](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/governance/ethics-hotline/default.aspx)\n  * [Email Alerts](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/resources/email-alerts/default.aspx)\n  * [Contacts](http://shareholders.morningstar.com/investor-relations/resources/contacts/default.aspx)\n\n\n\nFollow Morningstar\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/MorningstarInc)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/MorningstarInc)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/morningstar)\n  * [](https://www.instagram.com/morningstarinc/)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/user/morningstar)\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Morningstar, Inc.
