(NASDAQ: MNTS) (“Momentus” or the “Company”), a U.S. commercial space company that offers satellite buses and technologies, transportation, and other in‑space infrastructure services, today announced that it has been awarded a contract from the U.S. Defense Department’s Space Development Agency (SDA) for the Hybrid Acquisition for Proliferated LEO (HALO) program. \n\nSDA has been tasked with deploying a constellation of several hundred satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The SDA HALO program is designed to solicit and award rapid, cost-effective prototyping and spaceflight demonstrations to demonstrate new technology to be added to the constellation in future tranches. “SDA is proud to welcome 19 vendors into the first-ever HALO pool,” said SDA Director Derek Tournear. “This creative award solution enables SDA to quickly compete, build, and fly demonstration missions to burn down risk for the future of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. We also hope, through the HALO pool, to build a broader base of vendors that can compete for work on operational layers of future tranches.” \n\nOnly vendors selected for the HALO program can bid on specific demonstration prototype orders, with multiple prototype orders expected to be initiated and awarded annually. HALO offers a flexible and fast contracting mechanism to compete for and award follow-on contracts. \n\nMomentus is honored to be selected for HALO and looks forward to collaborating with the SDA on future demonstration missions and tranches. As a prime system integrator, Momentus has extensive experience working with various payload providers. The Momentus Vigoride bus is well-suited for these missions, designed to accommodate diverse payloads and conduct complex operations from our mission control center in San Jose, CA.\n\nPrototype orders under HALO will focus on rapid, end-to-end mission demonstrations, aiming to launch 12-18 months after the award. These demonstrations must be conducted by a Non-traditional Defense Contractor like Momentus, acting as the prime contractor. As part of the program, Momentus and key personnel will support both classified and unclassified programs. \n\n“We’re delighted by the opportunity to work with SDA to demonstrate key technologies that will help ensure our Nation’s safety and space superiority,” said Momentus Chief Executive Officer John Rood. “Vigoride’s flexibility, payload capacity, and power make it well-positioned to support a range of national security missions. With three launches in one year, Vigoride has proven it is ready to take on the most challenging missions.” \n\n**About Momentus Inc.**\n\nMomentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers commercial satellite buses and in-space infrastructure services including in-space transportation, hosted payloads, and other in-orbit services. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws.

(NASDAQ: MNTS) (“Momentus” or the “Company”), a U.S. commercial space company that offers satellite buses, transportation, and other in‑space infrastructure services, today announced that it received notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating the Company’s continued non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, pursuant to Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). \n\nAs previously reported, on March 27, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Bid Price Deficiency Notice”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its common stock has been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, it no longer complies with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. \n\nAdditionally, the Notice states that since the Company has not yet filed its Form 10-Qs for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, it no longer complies with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and that these matters individually serve as separate and additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market. \n\nThe Company intends to request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which will automatically stay the suspension of trading in the Company’s securities for a period of 15 days from the date of the request. The Company also intends to seek an extended stay pending the hearing, although no assurance can be provided that such an extension would be granted. \n\nThe Company is working to evidence compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Panel as part of the hearing process; however, there can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel. \n\nThe Notices have no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock and the common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MNTS.” \n\n**About Momentus Inc.**\n\nMomentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers commercial satellite buses and in-space infrastructure services including in-space transportation, hosted payloads, and other in-orbit services. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws.
