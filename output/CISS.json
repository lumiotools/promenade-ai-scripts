EBITDA represents net income/(loss) before interest and finance costs, interest income and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income/(loss) before interest and finance costs, interest income, depreciation, gain/(loss) on warrants and share based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EPS represents Adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to that reported by other companies in the shipping or other industries. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.\n\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are included herein because they are a basis, upon which we and our investors assess our financial performance. They allow us to present our performance from period to period on a comparable basis and provide investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding our operating performance.\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars, except number of shares)** | **Third Quarter Ended September 30th,** | **Nine-Month Period Ended September 30th,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024**  \n**_Net Income/(Loss) – Adjusted Net Income_**  \n**Net****income/****(loss)** | **3,331,044** | **5,074,563** | **3,719,169** | **(****2,895,769****)**  \n(Less)/Plus (gain)/loss on warrants | — | (4,825,723) | — | 10,350,813  \nPlus share based compensation | — | 78,149 | — | 204,629  \n**Adjusted Net****I****ncome** | **3,331,044** | **326,989** | **3,719,169** | **7,659,673**  \n**_Net_**** _I_**** _ncome_**** _/(Loss)_****_– EBITDA_**  \n**Net****income/(loss)** | **3,331,044** | **5,074,563** | **3,719,169** | **(****2,****895,769)**  \nPlus interest and finance costs | 620,282 | 443,387 | 621,011 | 2,143,810  \nLess interest income | — | (176,333) | — | (818,900)  \nPlus depreciation | 1,382,297 | 1,625,471 | 2,722,425 | 4,552,180  \n**EBITDA** | **5,333,623** | **6,967,088** | **7,062,605** | **2,981,321**  \n**_Net_**** _Income/(Loss)_****_– Adjusted EBITDA_**  \nNet income/(loss) | 3,331,044 | 5,074,563 | 3,719,169 | (2,895,769)  \n(Less)/Plus (gain)/loss on warrants | — | (4,825,723) | — | 10,350,813  \nPlus share based compensation | — | 78,149 | — | 204,629  \nPlus interest and finance costs | 620,282 | 443,387 | 621,011 | 2,143,810  \nLess interest income | — | (176,333) | — | (818,900)  \nPlus depreciation | 1,382,297 | 1,625,471 | 2,722,425 | 4,552,180  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **5,333,623** | **2,219,514** | **7,062,605** | **13,536,763**  \n**_EPS_**  \n**_Numerator_**  \nNet income/(loss) | 3,331,044 | 5,074,563 | 3,719,169 | (2,895,769)  \nLess: Cumulative dividends on preferred shares | (191,667) | (191,667) | (212,500) | (570,833)  \nLess: Undistributed earnings allocate to non-vested shares | — | (41,432) | — | —  \nLess: Down round deemed dividend on Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares | — | — | — | (2,862,000)  \nNet income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders, basic | 3,139,377 | 4,841,464 | 3,506,669 | (6,328,602)  \n**_Denominator_**  \nWeighted average number of shares | 73,012 | 6,974,686 | 45,706 | 3,955,613  \n**EPS – Basic** | **43.00** | **0.69** | **76.72** | **(1.60)**  \n**_Adjusted EPS_**  \n**_Numerator_**  \nAdjusted net income | 3,331,044 | 326,989 | 3,719,169 | 7,659,673  \nLess: Cumulative dividends on preferred shares | (191,667) | (191,667) | (212,500) | (570,833)  \nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to non-vested shares | — | (1,148) | — | (26,884)  \nLess: Down round deemed dividend on Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares | — | — | — | (2,862,000)  \nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, basic | 3,139,377 | 134,174 | 3,506,669 | 4,199,956  \n**_Denominator_**  \nWeighted average number of shares | 73,012 | 6,974,686 | 45,706 | 3,955,613  \n**Adjusted EPS****, Basic** | **43.00** | **0****.02** | **76.72** | **1.06**  \n  \n**Reconciliation of TCE:**\n\nTime Charter Equivalent rate or “TCE” rate is determined by dividing voyage revenue net of voyage expenses by voyage days for the relevant time period. TCE is a non-GAAP measure which provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with voyage revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Time charter equivalent revenues assisting the Company’s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. TCE is also a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company’s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters or time charters, but not bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. TCE assists our investors to assess our financial performance from period to period on a comparable basis and provide investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding our operating performance.\n\n**(Expressed in U.S. Dollars except for available days and Time charter equivalent rate)**  \n---  \n**Q3 2023** | **Q3 2024** | **9M 2023** | **9M 2024**  \nVoyage revenues |

Following this vessel acquisition and the delivery of the 33,664 DWT handysize drybulk carrier to our Company in May 2024, the total fleet capacity increased to 213,468 dwt. 10% of the purchase price was paid on delivery, with the remaining 90% due in April 2025.\n\n\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Results****:**\n\n  * _Voyage revenues_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to $12.8 million, an increase of $9.6 million compared to revenues of $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the revenues generated by our Aframax tanker acquired in July 2023. Total calendar days for our fleet were 273 and 180 days for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Of the total calendar days in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, 164, or 60.1% and 163 or 90.6%, were time charter days. Our fleet operational utilization was 93.4% and 90.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n  * _Voyage expenses and vessels’ operating expenses_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $2.8 million and $1.8 million respectively, compared to $0.3 million and $1.0 million respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increases in both voyage expenses and vessels’ operating expenses are attributed to the increase in the average number of our vessels following the acquisition of our Aframax tanker in July 2023 which operates in the spot market. Voyage expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 included bunkers cost of $1.8 million and $0.1 million, corresponding to 64.3% and 33.3% of total voyage expenses. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 mainly included crew expenses of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, corresponding to 50.0% and 60.0% of total vessel operating expenses, spares and consumables costs of $0.4 million and $0.3 million, corresponding to 22.2% and 30.0% of total vessel operating expenses, and maintenance expenses of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, representing works and repairs on the vessels, corresponding to 11.1% and 10.0%, of total vessel operating expenses.\n\n\n  * _Depreciation_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.4 million, a $0.7 million increase from $0.7 million for the same period of last year, due to the increase in the average number of our vessels.\n  * _Management fees_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $0.12 million, a $0.04 million increase from $0.08 million for the same period of last year, due to the increase in the average number of our vessels.\n\n\n  * _General and Administrative costs_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $1.5 million and mainly related to expenses incurred relating to the two public offerings and the reverse stock split and expenses incurred as a result of operating as a separate public company. General and Administrative costs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $0.2 million.\n  * _Interest and finance costs_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $0.8 million and mainly related to the accrued interest expense – related party as of March 31, 2024 in connection with the $38.7 million which is part of the acquisition price of our Aframax tanker Afrapearl II that is payable by July 2024.\n  * _Unrealized loss on warrants_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.6 million and related to net fair value losses of our Class B-1 and B-2 Warrants and Class C-1 and C-2 warrants which were issued during the first quarter of 2024 in connection with the two public offerings and have been classified as liabilities.\n  * As a result of the above, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reported a _net income_ of $3.8 million.\n  * _EBITDA_ for the three months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to $5.7 million.\n  * An average of 3.00 vessels were owned by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**CEO Dr. Diamantis Andriotis commented:**\n\n2024 started with an affluence of vigorous activities for C3is Inc. that will enable us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they arise.\n\nOur remarkable financial results during the first quarter of 2024 highlight our ability to capitalize on the solid freight rate environment. Indicatively, we managed to achieve a fleetwide time charter equivalent rate of $36,480 per day. As a result, we reported an EBITDA of $5.7 million and a Net Income of $3.8 million, representing increases of 302% and 404% compared to the equivalent period of 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the year, our cash balance increased by 286% since 2023-year end levels. Our strong cash flow generation from our profitable vessel operations as well as the completion of two follow-on equity offerings, generating aggregate net proceeds of $11.4 million, enabled our Company to further expand its fleet.\n\nSpecifically, in May, we took delivery of our recently acquired 2012 Japanese built dry bulk carrier, the Eco Spitfire. Following our latest fleet addition, our total fleet capacity has increased by 234% since the Company’s inception less than a year ago.\n\nLooking ahead, we believe that earnings momentum will remain generally favorable, prompting our continued focus on our fleet growth strategy.\n\nWe believe that our capital structure comprising of no bank debt and a strong cash balance, currently at over $40 million, will further enhance our Company’s ability to fund selective vessel acquisitions following payments of the remaining purchase prices for our Aframax tanker and our handysize dry bulk carrier.\n\nWe also aim at diversifying our fleet so as to have more impact on long-term profits via re-weighting of exposure to different segments, thus allowing stronger segments to bolster weaker ones, and smoothing returns over time.\n\n**Conference Call details:**\n\nOn May 28, 2024, at 11:00 am ET, the company’s management will host a conference call to present the results and the company’s operations and outlook.\n\n**Slides and audio webcast:**\n\nThere will also be a live and then archived webcast of the conference call, through C3is Inc. website (www.c3is.pro).

EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies in the shipping or other industries.\n\nEBITDA is included herein because it is a basis, upon which we and our investors assess our financial performance. It allows us to present our performance from period to period on a comparable basis and provides investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding our operating performance.\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars)**  \n---  \n**Q1 2023** | **Q1 2024**  \n**_Net income – EBITDA_**  \n**Net income** | **751,353** | **3,786,620**  \nPlus interest and finance costs | 305 | 752,546  \nLess interest income | – | (209,178)  \nPlus depreciation | 670,064 | 1,382,297  \n**EBITDA** | **1,421,722** | **5,712,285**  \n  \n**Reconciliation of TCE:**\n\nTime Charter Equivalent rate or “TCE” rate is determined by dividing revenue net of voyage expenses by voyage days for the relevant time period. TCE is a non-GAAP measure which provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Time charter equivalent revenues assists the Company’s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. TCE is also a standard shipping industry performance measure, useful to the investors, as it is used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company’s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters or time charters, but not bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods and compare two shipping companies despite the charter types of their vessels.\n\n**(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars except for available days and Time charter equivalent rate)**  \n---  \n**Q1 2023** | **Q1 2024**  \nRevenues | 3,151,845 |
