(“Agenus”) (Nasdaq: AGEN), a leader in developing novel\nimmunological agents to treat various cancers, today announced the presentation of new data on two of its\npromising investigational immunotherapy candidates, botensilimab and AGEN1721, at the Society for\nImmunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting in Houston, Texas. The data, showcasing potential\nbreakthroughs in treating immune-resistant tumors, will be presented by Dhan Chand, Ph.D., Vice President of\nResearch at Agenus.\nThe \u0000rst two presentations will spotlight botensilimab, an innovative, investigational, Fc-enhanced anti-CTLA-4\nantibody that has shown remarkable e\u0000cacy in overcoming immune barriers across several treatment-resistant\ncancers, including glioblastoma, melanoma, colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancers. Botensilimab’s unique\nmechanism of action enhances both innate and adaptive immunity to promote optimal T-cell priming, stimulate\nantigen-presenting cells, and deplete immune suppressing regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment,\ncreating a multi-pronged attack on cold and refractory tumors.\n“These \u0000ndings represent a signi\u0000cant milestone in understanding how botensilimab can be optimally combined\nwith both established and emerging therapies,” said Dr. Chand. “What’s particularly compelling is the profound\ne\u0000cacy we’re seeing in traditionally ‘cold’ tumors and treatment-resistant cancers—o\u0000ering potential new options\nfor patients with limited therapeutic choices.”\nFeatured botensilimab presentations:\n1\nPreclinical dose-pharmacokinetic-e\u0000cacy modeling of 527 Location: Exhibit Halls A B George R.

(“Agenus”) (Nasdaq: AGEN), a leader in discovering and\ndeveloping novel immunological agents to treat various cancers, today announced results for the third quarter\n2023. Agenus executives will host a conference call and webcast at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss the results and to\nprovide a corporate update.\nKey highlights include:\nRecent data shows that botensilimab (BOT), with or without balstilimab (BAL), is broadly e\u0000ective in treating\n\u0000ve advanced solid tumors: colorectal, pancreatic, lung, melanoma, and sarcoma.\nOver the past 12 months, clinical data on BOT/BAL has been featured in six oral or plenary sessions at major\ncancer conferences and published in peer-reviewed medical and scienti\u0000c journals.\nConsidering the poor treatment alternatives for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and the\npromising, long-lasting bene\u0000ts of BOT/BAL, a Biologics License Application (BLA) is anticipated for submission\nto the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC in mid-2024.\nEnrollment for the ACTIVATE-CRC Phase 2 Trial is complete; data readouts for the ACTIVATE-Pancreatic,\nACTIVATE-Melanoma, and the Phase 1b trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are expected throughout\n2024.\n\"The botensilimab franchise, after treating more than 750 patients, has demonstrated consistent tumor responses\nacross a diverse range of nine tumor types, showcasing its potential for signi\u0000cant impact in oncology,\" said Chief\nExecutive O\u0000cer, Garo Armen, Ph.D. \"The emerging data indicating the e\u0000cacy of botensilimab in earlier stages of\ncancer marks a notable shift towards less invasive treatment options. Agenus is forging ahead with a focus on our\nregulatory \u0000ling in CRC, advancing our robust clinical pipeline, and committing to deliver substantial outcomes for\n1\npatients and create value for our shareholders.\"\nNew and Updated Botensilimab Data at Corporate Event During ESMO 2023\nMicrosatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS CRC) Patients:\nIn an analysis of 70 patients evaluable for e\u0000cacy, those without active liver metastases exhibited a\ncon\u0000rmed response rate (ORR) of 24%, signi\u0000cantly surpassing the 2.8% achieved with standard of care (SOC).\n1\nThese patients demonstrated a 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 74%, with median OS not yet reached,\ncompared to a 12.9-month benchmark with 1, with a median follow-up of 12.3 months.\nBased on the totality of the evidence from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, Agenus plans to submit its BLA to the U.S.\nFDA for BOT/BAL in patients with 2/3L+ MSS CRC in mid-2024 and an EU marketing authorization \u0000ling in 2025.\nInteractions with regulatory agencies are ongoing.\n2\nNeoadjuvant CRC*:\nTreatment with one dose of BOT and two doses of BAL resulted in considerable tumor size reduction within\napproximately four weeks prior to surgery.\nAll three patients with MSI-H CRC experienced major pathological responses (>90%), while 67% (6/9) of MSS\nCRC patients who don’t normally respond to other Immuno-oncology (IO) treatments, had responses 50% or\ngreater, including two complete responses.\nAgenus plans to prioritize neoadjuvant development and is evaluating study designs for potential registration.\n2L Metastatic Pancreatic:\nIn FOLFIRINOX relapsed/refractory (2L) metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, all of whom had liver\nmetastases, 4 of 6 experienced marked tumor marker reductions associated with ongoing tumor reductions\nwhen treated with gemcitabine-Abraxane in combination with botensilimab.\nA Phase 2 randomized study is in progress, with an update expected in the \u0000rst half of 2024 and a possible\nsupplemental BLA \u0000ling in 2025.\n2L+ CTLA-4/PD-1 Relapsed Refractory Advanced Melanoma:\nPhase 1b expansion cohort in advanced melanoma reported a 30% ORR and 60% disease control rate; all\npatients had failed anti-PD-1 therapy and 8/10 had failed both anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy.\nThe Phase 2 results are expected in the second half of 2024, with the BOT monotherapy arm fully enrolled,\nand approximately 30 patients in the BOT/BAL combination arm. We are currently de\u0000ning strategies for the\nrapid enrollment of BOT in melanoma patients who are refractory to current IO treatments and expect to\npursue rapid registration strategies in 2024.\nRefractory NSCLC:\nIn the PD(L)-1 refractory cohort, a 56% ORR and an 89% disease control rate were observed in patients\ntreated with the BOT/BAL combination (n=9).\nIn the EGFR mutation refractory cohort, two objective responses were observed with one patient experiencing\na -90% tumor reduction at 12 weeks.\nPhase 1b results are expected in mid-2024, with approximately 50 patients enrolled. With the data generated,\nwe are in the process of designing trials to support rapid approval in patients that are refractory to PD-1, as\nwell as cohorts of patients with mutations, who have no viable treatment options.\nAdvanced Sarcomas:\nUpdated \u0000ndings from a Phase 1b study of 41 e\u0000cacy evaluable patients presented at ESMO 2023 showed\n3\ncontinued e\u0000cacy, with an ORR of 20%, a median response duration of 19.4 months (iRECIST), and a 6-month\nprogression-free survival rate of 40%.\nA higher ORR was observed by dose level, with 29% at 2 mg/kg BOT compared to 15% at 1 mg/kg BOT.\n4\nCorporate Partnership Progress:\nBMS-986442 (AGEN1777) – An Fc-Enhanced TIGIT Bispeci\u0000c:\nBristol Myers Squibb's BMS-986442, originally developed by Agenus and known as AGEN1777, is a bispeci\u0000c\nantagonist targeting both TIGIT and CD96. This therapeutic is designed to augment tumor-reactive T cell activity\nthrough its Fc-enhanced region. Following the licensing agreement in 2021, the phase 1 study in solid tumors\nconcluded successfully. Currently, a phase 2 dose expansion study is underway, assessing BMS-986442 in\ncombination with nivolumab, with or without chemotherapy. The screening for this phase commenced on October\n13, 2023, and dosing of the \u0000rst phase 2 patient is scheduled for November, which will result in a milestone\npayment for Agenus.\nThird Quarter 2023 Financial Overview:\nGiven the current environment in the biotech sector and our \u0000nancial resource needs to drive our objectives, we\nhave taken and will continue to take steps to contain our costs. We are actively pursuing immediate prospects for\nadditional cash infusion that don’t involve stock issuances, including a milestone payment from one of our\npartnered programs, expected by the end of 2023. In addition to this expected milestone, we are in the process of\nselling two non-strategic assets and the partial sale of other milestones and royalties due to Agenus from our\npartnered programs. These three sales are expected to close by the end of the \u0000rst half of 2024. With our end of\nthird quarter cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment balance of $106.3 million, along with these four\nplanned transactions, we believe we are su\u0000ciently funded through the end of 2024. In addition to these planned\ntransactions, we are also in advanced discussions for a potential structured \u0000nancing for BOT/BAL as well as a\npotential corporate collaboration with a large pharma or biotech company.\nThe third quarter 2023 closed with a consolidated cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balance of\n$106.3 million, compared to $193.4 million at on December 31, 2022.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue, which includes non-cash\nrevenue, of $24.3 million and $72.5 million, respectively. Including non-cash expenses of $28.1 million, we incurred\na net loss of $64.5 million for the third quarter. For the nine months of 2023, we incurred a net loss of $208.9\nmillion including non-cash expenses of $82 million.\nSelect Financial Information\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\n5\nSeptember 30,\n2023 December 31, 2022\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 106,305 $ 193,358\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRevenues, royalty sales milestone $ - $ 7,934 $ - $ 25,250\nRevenues, non-cash royalty 20,360 9,224 61,534 27,001\nRevenues, research and development 3,414 4,573 8,515 13,220\nRevenues, other 540 1,041 2,464 4,167\nTotal Revenue 24,314 22,772 72,513 69,638\nResearch and development expenses 51,443 46,011 167,846 133,412\nGeneral and administrative expenses 18,909 18,105 57,562 55,971\nCost of service revenue 303 308 2,851 2,875\nOther income (866) (971) (2,470) (9,745)\nNon-cash interest expense 19,057 16,041 55,977 44,629\nNon-cash contingent consideration fair value adjustment - (7) (398) (950)\nNet loss* $ (64,532) $ (56,715) $ (208,855) $ (156,554)\nNet loss per share attributable to Agenus Inc. common\nstockholders $ (0.16) $ (0.19) $ (0.57) $ (0.54)\n6\nConference Call\nTo access dial-in numbers, please register here.\nConference ID: 73242\nWebcast\nA live webcast and replay of the conference call will be accessible from the Events & Presentations page of the\nCompany’s website at https://investor.agenusbio.com/events-and-presentations/ and via\nhttps://events.q4inc.com/attendee/357374738.\nReferences\n1. Cohen et al. ASCO Annual Meeting 2023\n*Investigator Sponsored Trial (IST)\nAbout Botensilimab\nBotensilimab is an investigational multifunctional anti-CTLA-4 immune activator (antibody) designed to boost both\ninnate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Its novel design leverages mechanisms of action to extend\nimmunotherapy bene\u0000ts to \"cold\" tumors which generally respond poorly to standard of care or are refractory to\nconventional PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies and investigational therapies. Botensilimab augments immune responses\nacross a wide range of tumor types by priming and activating T cells, downregulating intratumoral regulatory T cells,\nactivating myeloid cells and inducing long-term memory responses.\nApproximately 750 patients have been treated with botensilimab in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Botensilimab\nalone, or in combination with Agenus’ investigational PD-1 antibody, balstilimab, has shown clinical responses\nacross nine metastatic, late-line cancers. For more information about botensilimab trials, visit\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov with the identi\u0000ers NCT03860272, NCT05608044, NCT05630183, and NCT05529316.\nAbout Agenus\nAgenus is a leading immuno-oncology company targeting cancer and infectious diseases with a comprehensive\npipeline of immunological agents.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNote A - Business, Liquidity and Basis of Presentation\nAgenus Inc. (including its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “Agenus,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a leading clinical-stage\nbiotechnology company developing therapies targeting cancer with a robust pipeline of immunological agents. Our mission is to expand patient populations\nbenefiting from cancer immunotherapy through combination approaches, using a broad repertoire of antibody therapeutics, adoptive cell therapies (through our\nsubsidiary MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. (“MiNK”)), and vaccine adjuvants (through our subsidiary SaponiQx, Inc. (“SaponiQx”)). We believe that combination\ntherapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will significantly expand the patient population benefiting from immuno-oncology (“I-O”)\ntreatments.\nIn addition to our diverse pipeline, we have established fully integrated capabilities encompassing novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line\ndevelopment, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) manufacturing. We believe these integrated capabilities enable us to develop and, if approved,\ncommercialize novel candidates on accelerated timelines compared to industry standards. Through independent development and strategic partnerships, we\nleverage our scientific expertise and capabilities to drive innovation in the I-O field.\nOur I-O portfolio is driven by several platforms and programs, which we plan to utilize individually and in combination:\n• Multiple antibody discovery platforms, including proprietary display technologies, to identify future antibody candidates.\n• Antibody candidate programs, including our lead asset, botensilimab, an Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 antibody. At a corporate update at the European\nSociety for Medical Oncology in October 2023, we presented updated data based on a total of 70 efficacy evaluable refractory microsatellite\nstable metastatic colorectal cancer patients with no active liver metastases from the Phase 1 study. These patients received the combination of\nbotensilimab (either 1 or 2 mg/kg every 6 weeks) and balstilimab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The results showed a survival and efficacy benefit\ncompared to what has been reported for standard of care in a comparable patient population. The 12-month overall survival (“OS”) was 74% with\na median OS not yet reached, after a median follow up of 12.3 months, compared to a median OS of 12.9 months reported for standard of care.\nThe confirmed overall response rate based on RECIST 1.1 was 24% compared to 2.8% reported with standard of care.\n• Our saponin-based vaccine adjuvant platform, primarily centered around our STIMULON cultured plant cell (“cpc”) QS-21 adjuvant\n(“STIMULON cpc QS-21”).\n• A pipeline of novel allogeneic invariant natural killer T cell therapies for treating cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, controlled by\nMiNK.\nOur business activities encompass various areas such as product research, preclinical and clinical development, intellectual property prosecution,\nmanufacturing, regulatory and clinical affairs, corporate finance and development activities, and support of collaborations. Our strategy includes developing and\ncommercializing product candidates through existing and new collaborations.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2023 were $106.3 million, a decrease of $87.1 million from December 31, 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents of our subsidiary, MiNK, at June 30, 2023, were $10.6 million. MiNK cash can only be accessed by Agenus through a declaration of\na dividend by the MiNK Board of Directors or through settlement of intercompany balances.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion.\nWe have financed our operations through income and revenues generated from corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and proceeds from equity\nissuances. Based on our current plans and projections, we believe that our cash resources of $106.3 million at September 30, 2023, plus additional funding we\nanticipate from the achievement of a milestone under an existing partnership, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least one year from\nwhen these financial statements were issued. This milestone will be triggered upon dosing the first patient in a clinical trial which is currently screening patients\nand is expected to occur by end of 2023. However, until this event occurs, in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance we are required to disclose that\nsubstantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition to the expected milestone payment by end of 2023, we are in active discussions to sell two non-strategic assets expected to close in the first\nhalf of 2024 with an estimated aggregate value of approximately $65.0 million. These transactions could extend our cash resources well beyond 2024. We are\nalso in advanced discussions for a potential structured financing for\n7\nbotensilimab/balstilimab, as well as a potential corporate collaboration with a large pharma or biotech company. None of these sources of cash involve equity or\ndebt issuance.\nManagement continues to address the Company’s liquidity position and has the flexibility to adjust spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity. In\nAugust 2023, we prioritized and focused our resources to accelerate the development, registration, and commercialization of our lead asset postponing all\npreclinical and other clinical programs and reducing our workforce by approximately 25%. Our CEO, Dr. Garo Armen has elected to receive his base salary and\nany potential bonus payments in stock rather than cash. We continuously evaluate the likelihood of success of our programs. As such, our decisions to continue\nto fund or eliminate funding of each of our programs are predicated on these determinations, on an ongoing basis. We expect our sources of funding to include\npayments from current collaborations which include milestones and royalty payments from companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, UroGen\nPharma Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Incyte Corporation, and Merck Sharpe & Dohme; out-licensing and/or partnering opportunities for our portfolio programs\nand product candidates with multiple parties; additional third-party agreements; asset sales; royalty monetization; project financing, and/or sales of equity\nsecurities.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of our management,\nthe condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial\nposition and operating results. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. For further\ninformation, refer to our consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nFor our foreign subsidiaries, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars\nusing rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. The\ncumulative translation adjustment resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income in total stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nIn 2023, we deconsolidated certain foreign subsidiaries and recognized a gain of $132,000, included in \"Other income (expense)\" on our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote B - Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding (including common shares issuable under our Amended and Restated Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, or “DDCP”). Diluted loss per\ncommon share is calculated by dividing loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (including\ncommon shares issuable under our DDCP) plus the dilutive effect of outstanding instruments such as warrants, stock options, non-vested shares and convertible\npreferred stock. Because we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented, diluted loss per common share is the same as\nbasic loss per common share, as the effect of utilizing the fully diluted share count would have reduced the net loss per common share.

Pursuant to the terms of the HCR\nRoyalty Purchase Agreement, we sold to HCR 100% of Antigenics’ worldwide rights to receive royalties from GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”) on sales of GSK’s\nvaccines containing our QS-21 STIMULON adjuvant. At closing, we received gross proceeds of $190.0 million from HCR. Although we sold all of our rights\nto receive royalties on sales of GSK’s vaccines containing QS-21, as a result of our obligation to HCR, we are required to account for the $190.0 million in\nproceeds from this transaction as a liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet that will be recognized into revenue in proportion to the royalty\npayments from GSK to HCR over the estimated life of the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement. The liability is classified between the current and non-current\nportion of liability related to sale of future royalties and milestones in the condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated royalty payments to be\nreceived by HCR in the next 12 months from the financial statement reporting date.\n10\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $61.5 million of non-cash royalty revenue, and we recorded $55.8 million of related\nnon-cash interest expense related to the HCR Royalty Purchase Agreement.\nAs royalties are remitted to HCR from GSK, the balance of the recorded liability will be effectively repaid over the life of the HCR Royalty Purchase\nAgreement. To determine the amortization of the recorded liability, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by\nHCR. The sum of these amounts less the $190.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the HCR Royalty Purchase\nAgreement. Periodically, we assess the estimated royalty payments to be paid to HCR from GSK, and to the extent the amount or timing of the payments is\nmaterially different from our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the liability, and the related recognition of interest expense.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased to 29.4%, which\nresults in a life of contract interest rate of 23.4%.\nNote G - Accrued and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consisted of the following as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nPayroll $ 10,853 $ 15,872\nProfessional fees 6,250 6,946\nContract manufacturing costs 3,822 1,848\nResearch services 11,387 7,074\nOther 5,317 6,519\nTotal $ 37,629 $ 38,259\nOther current liabilities consisted of the following as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFinance lease liabilities $ 10,190 $ 7,952\nOther 3,226 3,505\nTotal $ 13,416 $ 11,457\n11\nNote H - Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized below (in thousands):\nQuoted Prices\nin\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nSeptember 30, Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (Note C) $ 96,482 $ 96,482 $ — $ —\nLong-term investments 4,682 4,682 — —\nTotal $ 101,164 $ 101,164 $ — $ —\nLiabilities:\nContingent purchase price considerations $ 476 $ — $ — $ 476\nTotal $ 476 $ — $ — $ 476\nQuoted Prices\nin\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (Note C) $ 164,694 $ — $ — $ —\nShort-term investments (Note C) 14,689 — — —\nTotal $ 179,383 $ — $ — $ —\nLiabilities:\nContingent purchase price consideration $ 874 $ — $ — $ 874\nTotal $ 874 $ — $ — $ 874\nLong-term investments are included in \"Other long-term assets\" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nWe measure our contingent purchase price considerations at fair value. The fair values of our contingent purchase price considerations at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" in our condensed consolidated balance\nsheets, are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require them to be reported as Level 3 liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The\nvaluation of these liabilities use assumptions we believe would be made by a market participant and are mainly based on estimates from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation of our share price, as well as other factors impacting the probability of triggering the milestone payments. Share price was evolved using a geometric\nBrownian motion, calculated daily for the life of the contingent purchase price considerations.\nThe fair value of our outstanding debt balance at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $13.1 million and $13.2 million, respectively, based\non the Level 2 valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurements standard using a present value methodology that was derived by evaluating the nature and\nterms of each note and considering the prevailing economic and market conditions at the balance sheet date. The principal amount of our outstanding debt\nbalance at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $13.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively.\nNote I - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nGilead Collaboration Agreement\nOn December 20, 2018, we entered into a series of agreements with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) focused on the development and commercialization\nof up to five novel immuno-oncology therapies. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, the option and license agreements and the stock purchase\nagreement we entered into with Gilead (collectively, the “Gilead Collaboration Agreements”), at the closing of the transaction on January 23, 2019, we received\nan upfront cash payment from Gilead of $120.0 million and Gilead made a $30.0 million equity investment in Agenus. On November 6, 2020, we received\nnotice from Gilead that it was returning AGEN1423 to us and voluntarily terminating the applicable license agreement. The termination was effective as of\nFebruary 4, 2021. In the third quarter of 2021 we ceased development of AGEN1223 and in October 2021 the AGEN1223 option and license agreement was\nformally terminated. The AGEN2373 option and license agreement and the stock purchase agreement remain in full force and effect. We remain eligible to\nreceive a $50.0 million exercise fee and, if exercised, up to $520.0 million in aggregate potential milestones.\n12\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized approximately $2.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of research and\ndevelopment revenue based on the partial satisfaction of the over time performance obligations as of quarter end.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of research and development revenue based on the partial\nsatisfaction of the over time performance obligations as of period end. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized research and\ndevelopment revenue of $5.0 million related to the achievement of a milestone and $7.1 million based on the partial satisfaction of the over time performance\nobligations as of period end.\nWe expect to recognize deferred research and development revenue of $5.0 million for the remainder of 2023 related to performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of September 30, 2023.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents revenue (in thousands) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, disaggregated by geographic\nregion and revenue type.

The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. Currently, we do not have any contract\nassets which have not transferred to a receivable. We had no asset impairment charges related to contract assets in the period. Contract liabilities primarily relate\nto contracts where we received payments but have not yet satisfied the related performance obligations. The advance consideration received from customers for\nresearch and development services or licenses bundled with other promises is a contract liability until the underlying performance obligations are transferred to\nthe customer.\nThe following table provides information about contract liabilities from contracts with customers (in thousands):\nBalance at\nbeginning of Balance at end\nNine months ended September 30, 2023 period Additions Deductions of period\nContract liabilities:\nDeferred revenue $ 13,412 $ 22 $ (7,297) $ 6,137\nThe change in contract liabilities is primarily related to the recognition of $7.2 million of revenue related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreements during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. Deferred revenue related to the Gilead Collaboration Agreements of $5.0 million as of September 30, 2023, which\nwas comprised of the $142.5 million initial transaction price, less $137.5 million of license and collaboration revenue recognized from the effective date of the\ncontract, will be recognized as the combined performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe also recorded a $1.0 million receivable as of September 30, 2023, for research and development and other services provided.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not recognize any revenue from amounts included in the contract asset or the contract\nliability balances from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. None of the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract were capitalized.\nNote J - Share-based Compensation Plans\nWe primarily use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees and non-employees, including stock options\ngranted to members of our Board of Directors. However, the fair value of stock option market-based awards is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation as\nof the date of issuance.

The fair value of non-vested market-based awards is calculated based on a\nMonte Carlo simulation as of the date of issuance. The fair value of other non-vested stock is calculated based on the closing sale price of our common stock on\nthe date of issuance.\nA summary of non-vested stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNon-vested Grant Date\nShares Fair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 355,802 $ 2.50\nGranted 5,304,201 2.35\nVested (4,728,222) 2.45\nForfeited (235,000) 2.11\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 696,781 $ 1.85\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was approximately $1.1 million of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to these non-vested shares\nand non-vested shares granted under subsidiary plans which will be recognized over a period of 2.3 years.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 449,391 shares were issued under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 46,750 shares were\nissued as a result of stock option exercises and 84,414 shares were issued as a result of the vesting of non-vested stock. Additionally, 4,643,808 shares were\nissued as payment for certain employee bonuses, with 1,668,767 of those shares being withheld to cover taxes, resulting in a net share issuance of 2,975,041.\nThe impact on our results of operations from share-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, was as\nfollows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nResearch and development $ 1,464 $ 1,200 $ 4,853 $ 3,731\nGeneral and administrative 4,072 3,234 12,210 10,265\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 5,536 $ 4,434 $ 17,063 $ 13,996\nNote K – Restricted Cash\nAs of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we maintained non-current restricted cash of $3.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

The\nRegistration Statement included both a base prospectus that covered the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of common stock, preferred\nstock, warrants, debt securities and units of Agenus and a prospectus supplement for the potential offer and sale of up to 184,638,269 shares of common stock\n(the “Placement Shares”) in “at the market” offerings pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement by and between Agenus and B. Riley Securities, Inc.\n(the “Sales Agent”), dated as of July 22, 2020 (the “Sales Agreement”). Sales pursuant to the Sales Agreement will be made only upon our\n15\ninstruction to the Sales Agent, and we cannot provide assurances that we will issue any additional Placement Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net proceeds of approximately $20.4 million and $123.2 million from the sale\nof approximately 13.3 million and 71.6 million shares of our common stock, respectively, in at-the-market offerings under the Sales Agreement.\nNote M – Non-controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, relates to the\nfollowing approximate interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries, which we do not own.\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nMiNK Therapeutics, Inc. 37% 22%\nSaponiQx, Inc. 30% 30%\nChanges in non-controlling interest for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBeginning balance $ 6,376 $ 13,469\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest (9,384) (10,582)\nOther items:\nDistribution of subsidiary shares to Agenus stockholders 14,888 —\nPurchase of subsidiary shares (1,861) —\nIssuance of subsidiary shares for employee bonus 1,011 294\nIssuance of subsidiary shares under employee stock purchase plan 48 —\nSubsidiary share-based compensation 2,742 3,195\nTotal other items 16,828 3,489\nEnding balance $ 13,820 $ 6,376\nDistribution of subsidiary shares to Agenus stockholders\nOn March 29, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a stock dividend (the \"Dividend\") consisting of an aggregate of 5.0 million shares (the \"Dividend\nStock\") of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of MiNK held by Agenus to record holders of Agenus' common stock, par value $0.01 per share as of\nthe close of business on April 17, 2023 (the \"Record Date\").\nOn May 1, 2023, we paid the Dividend and distributed 0.0146 of a share of the Dividend Stock for each share of Agenus Common Stock outstanding as\nof the close of business on the Record Date.

Subsequent to the distribution of the\nDividend Stock, we maintained a controlling voting interest in MiNK.\nPurchase of subsidiary shares\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased 408,518 shares of MiNK common stock in multiple open market transactions.\nNote N – Related Party Transactions\nIn 2023, our Audit and Finance Committee approved a contract between Avillion Life Sciences LTD (\"Avillion\") and Agenus for the performance of up\nto $450,000 of clinical consulting services. Allison Jeynes, a member of our Board of Directors, is chief executive officer of Avillion. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, approximately $450,000 related to these services is included in “Research and development” expense in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations.\n16\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Audit and Finance Committee approved, and we performed research and development\nmanufacturing services totaling $256,000 for Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc (\"Protagenic\"). We will be reimbursed for these services on an actual time and\nmaterials basis. Dr. Garo H. Armen, our CEO, is Executive Chairman of and has a greater than 10% equity interest in Protagenic.\nNote O - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued and Adopted\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) that will eliminate the\nrequirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, an impairment charge will be based on the excess\nof a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNo other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 had or is expected to have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n17\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements\nwithin the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). You can\nidentify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “may,” “project,” “guidance,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “future” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any\ndiscussion of future operating or financial performance.

All rights\nreserved.\nOverview\nWe are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies targeting cancer with a robust pipeline of immunological agents. Our\nmission is to expand patient populations benefiting from cancer immunotherapy through combination approaches, using a broad repertoire of antibody\ntherapeutics, adoptive cell therapies (through our subsidiary MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. (“MiNK”)), and vaccine adjuvants (through our subsidiary SaponiQx,\nInc. (“SaponiQx”)). We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will significantly expand the patient population\nbenefiting from immuno-oncology (“I-O”) treatments.\nIn addition to our diverse pipeline, we have established fully integrated capabilities encompassing novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line\ndevelopment, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) manufacturing. We believe these integrated capabilities enable us to develop and, if approved,\ncommercialize novel candidates on accelerated timelines compared to industry standards. Through independent development and strategic partnerships, we\nleverage our scientific expertise and capabilities to drive innovation in the I-O field.\nOur I-O portfolio is driven by several platforms and programs, which we plan to utilize individually and in combination:\n• Multiple antibody discovery platforms, including proprietary display technologies, to identify future antibody candidates.\n• Antibody candidate programs, including our lead asset, botensilimab, an Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 antibody. At a corporate update at the European\nSociety for Medical Oncology in October 2023, we presented updated data based on a total of 70 efficacy evaluable refractory microsatellite\nstable metastatic colorectal cancer patients with no active liver metastases from the Phase 1 study. These patients received the combination of\nbotensilimab (either 1 or 2 mg/kg every 6 weeks) and balstilimab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The results showed a survival and efficacy benefit\ncompared to what has been reported for standard of care in a comparable patient population. The 12-month overall survival (“OS”) was 74% with\na median OS not yet reached, after a median follow up of 12.3 months, compared to a median OS of 12.9 months reported for standard of care.\nThe confirmed overall response rate based on RECIST 1.1 was 24% compared to 2.8% reported with standard of care.\n• Our saponin-based vaccine adjuvant platform, primarily centered around our STIMULON cultured plant cell (“cpc”) QS-21 adjuvant\n(“STIMULON cpc QS-21”).\n18\n• A pipeline of novel allogeneic invariant natural killer T cell (“iNKT”) therapies for treating cancer and other immune-mediated diseases,\ncontrolled by MiNK.\nWe regularly evaluate development, commercialization, and partnering strategies for each product candidate based on various factors, including pre-\nclinical and clinical trial results, competitive positioning, funding requirements, and available resources. Our lead program, botensilimab (AGEN1181), is\nprogressing through multiple clinical programs designed to support accelerated development as a monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab. In 2022,\nwe initiated global Phase 2 trials for botensilimab in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. In October 2023, we completed\nenrollment of the Phase 2 microsatellite stable colorectal cancer trial. In April 2023, the botensilimab/balstilimab combination received Fast Track designation\nfrom the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of non-MSI-H/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer\npatients without active liver involvement. We intend to file our first biologics license application for the botensilimab/balstilimab combination in colorectal\ncancer in midyear 2024.\nWe have established collaborations with several companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.\n(“Betta”), UroGen Pharma Ltd. (\"UroGen\"), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”), and Merck Sharpe & Dohme (“Merck”). These\ncollaborations, along with our internal programs, have resulted in over a dozen antibody programs currently in pre-clinical or clinical development.\nOur collaboration agreement with Incyte grants Incyte exclusive licenses for monospecific antibodies targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3, LAG-3, and an\nundisclosed target. Incyte has been advancing these antibodies in clinical trials. Incyte has terminated the OX40 program, effective October 2023, and has\nnotified us of their intent to terminate both the GITR program and undisclosed program, effective May 2024. Upon termination, the rights to the OX40, GITR,\nand undisclosed programs revert back to us. Incyte is responsible for all future development expenses for the remaining programs, and we are eligible to receive\nup to an additional $315.0 million in potential milestone payments, along with royalties on future sales.\nUnder our collaboration and license agreement with Merck, we have exclusively licensed a monospecific antibody targeting ILT4 to them, which is\ncurrently being advanced in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Merck is responsible for all future development expenses, and we are eligible to receive up to an additional\n$85.0 million in potential milestone payments, as well as royalties on future sales.\nIn September 2018, through our subsidiary Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the “XOMA Royalty Purchase\nAgreement”) with XOMA (US) LLC (\"XOMA\"). Pursuant to the agreement, XOMA purchased 33% of all future royalties and 10% of all future milestone\npayments that we are entitled to receive from Incyte and Merck, after satisfying our obligations to a third party. As of September 30, 2023, we remain eligible to\nreceive up to $283.5 million and $76.5 million in potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestones from Incyte and Merck, respectively, after\naccounting for our obligations under the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement.\nIn December 2018, we entered into collaboration agreements with Gilead for the development and commercialization of up to five novel I-O therapies\n(the “Gilead Collaboration Agreements”). Gilead received worldwide exclusive rights to our bispecific antibody, AGEN1423, and the exclusive option to\nlicense AGEN1223, a bispecific antibody, and AGEN2373, a monospecific antibody. All three assets are currently in clinical development. Gilead elected to\nreturn AGEN1423 to us in November 2020 and terminated the license agreement. We ceased development of AGEN1223 in the third quarter of 2021, and the\noption and license agreement for AGEN1223 were formally terminated in October 2021. The AGEN2373 option agreement remains in place, and we are\nresponsible for developing the program until the option decision point. If Gilead exercises the option, we may opt-in to share development and\ncommercialization costs in the United States in exchange for a 50:50 profit (loss) share and revised milestone payments. In March 2022, we received a $5.0\nmillion clinical milestone under the AGEN2373 option agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the AGEN2373 option agreement, we remain eligible to receive a\n$50.0 million option exercise fee and up to an additional $520.0 million in aggregate milestone payments, as well as royalties on future sales.\nIn November 2019, we entered into a license agreement with UroGen, granting them an exclusive, worldwide license (not including Argentina, Brazil,\nChile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and their respective territories and possessions) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize zalifrelimab for the treatment of\ncancers of the urinary tract via intravesical delivery. We received an upfront payment of $10.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $200.0 million in\nmilestone payments, as well as royalties on future sales.\nIn June 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Betta License Agreement”) with Betta, pursuant to which we granted Betta an\nexclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize balstilimab and zalifrelimab in Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (“Greater\nChina”). Under the terms of the Betta License Agreement, we received $15.0 million upfront and are eligible to receive up to $100.0 million in milestone\npayments plus royalties on any future sales in Greater China.\n19\nIn May 2021, we entered into a License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with BMS for our pre-clinical anti-TIGIT bispecific antibody\nprogram, AGEN1777. BMS received an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AGEN1777 and its derivatives. We retained\nan option to access the licensed antibodies for use in clinical studies in combination with certain pipeline assets. We received a non-refundable upfront cash\npayment of $200.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $1.36 billion in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, along with tiered\nroyalties. BMS is responsible for all associated costs, and we have the option to co-fund a minority of global development costs in exchange for increased tiered\nroyalties. We also have the option to co-promote AGEN1777 in the U.S. In October 2021, we achieved a $20.0 million milestone upon the dosing of the first\npatient in the AGEN1777 Phase 1 clinical trial.\nIn September 2021, we launched SaponiQx to lead innovation in novel adjuvant discovery and vaccine design, focusing on our saponin-based adjuvants.\nWe are particularly dedicated to the development of the next-generation cultured plant cell QS-21. To support this initiative, we partnered with Ginkgo\nBioworks, Inc. to develop SaponiQx’s saponin products from sustainably sourced raw materials. Our goal is to meet the demands of the vaccine industry,\nespecially for pandemic vaccines.\nOur bark extract QS-21 adjuvant is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”) and plays a vital role in multiple GSK vaccine programs. These programs\nare at various stages, including GSK’s approved shingles vaccine, SHINGRIX, which received FDA approval in the United States in October 2017.\nIn January 2018, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and its affiliates (“HCR”). HCR purchased\nour worldwide rights to receive royalties from GSK on GSK’s sales of vaccines containing our QS-21 adjuvant. We do not incur clinical development costs for\nproducts partnered with GSK.\nUnder the agreement with HCR, we were entitled to receive milestone payments based on GSK’s vaccine sales. These milestones include $15.1 million\nupon GSK reaching $2.0 billion in last-twelve-months net sales prior to 2024 (the “First HCR Milestone”) and $25.25 million upon GSK reaching $2.75 billion\nin last-twelve-months net sales prior to 2026 (the “Second HCR Milestone”). We received the First HCR Milestone after GSK’s net sales of SHINGRIX for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2019, exceeded $2.0 billion, and we received the Second HCR Milestone after GSK’s net sales of SHINGRIX for the\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2022, exceeded $2.75 billion.\nOur business activities encompass various areas such as product research, preclinical and clinical development, intellectual property prosecution,\nmanufacturing, regulatory and clinical affairs, corporate finance and development activities, and support of collaborations. Our strategy includes developing and\ncommercializing product candidates through existing and new collaborations.\nAgenus' subsidiary MiNK completed an initial public offering in October 2021 and is publicly traded on Nasdaq under the symbol INKT. MiNK is a\nclinical-stage precision oncology company developing unmodified and engineered INKT cell therapies for cancer and other immune-mediated diseases. Their\nlead product candidate, agenT-797, is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy. A Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumors as a\nmonotherapy and in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors (KEYTRUDA® and OPDIVO®) has been initiated and enrolled, and data was presented\nin April at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. The presentation showcased the activity of agenT-797 alone and in combination with\nanti-PD-1, with a 42% tumor reduction in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer who had no response to prior anti-PD-1 therapy or standard chemotherapy.\nBenefit was seen in additional solid tumor types, including durable disease stabilization and biomarker responses in NSCLC, testicular, and appendiceal\ncancers, that were refractory to anti-PD-1. MiNK is also evaluating agenT-797 as a variant-agnostic therapy for patients with viral acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome, and top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated a 77% survival rate in older, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 respiratory\nfailure. Through an assignment and license agreement with Agenus, MiNK owns the INKT technology and has the rights to develop a proprietary pipeline of\nengineered CAR-INKTs, TCRs, and INKT bispecific engagers.\nHistorical Results of Operations\nThree months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nWe recognized research and development revenue of approximately $3.4 million and $4.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.

Our product candidates are in various stages of development and significant additional expenditures will be\nrequired if we start new clinical trials, encounter delays in our programs, apply for regulatory approvals, continue development of our technologies, expand our\noperations, and/or bring our product candidates to market. The total cost of any particular clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design,\nlength of the trial, number of clinical sites, number of patients, and trial sponsorship. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new\ntherapeutic products is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Because of the current stage of our product candidates, among other factors, we are unable to reliably\nestimate the cost of completing our research and development programs or the timing for bringing such programs to various markets or substantial partnering or\nout-licensing arrangements, and, therefore, when, if ever, material cash inflows are likely to commence.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred annual operating losses since inception, and we had an accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2023. We expect to\nincur significant losses over the next several years as we continue development of our technologies and product\n22\ncandidates, manage our regulatory processes, initiate and continue clinical trials, and prepare for potential commercialization of products. To date, we have\nfinanced our operations primarily through corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and the issuance of equity. From our inception through September 30,\n2023, we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion through the sale of common and preferred stock, the exercise of stock options and\nwarrants, proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, royalty monetization transactions, and the issuance of convertible and other notes.\nWe maintain an effective registration statement (the “Registration Statement”), covering common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and\nunits. The Registration Statement includes prospectuses covering the offer, issuance and sale of up to 184.6 million shares of our common stock from time to\ntime in “at-the-market offerings” pursuant to an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. as our sales agent.\nWe sold approximately 71.6 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for\naggregate net proceeds totaling $123.2 million. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 171.3 million shares remained available for sale under the Sales\nAgreement.\nWe have funded our operations largely from cash received from partners, royalty financing transactions and equity offerings. We transact at-the-market\nsales from time to time in order to manage our cash balances to make sure cash balances do not drop below a certain level based on our anticipated uses of cash.\nWe execute at-the-market offerings based on market conditions and our stock price. We do not have in place a program whereby at-the-market offerings are\nexecuted automatically based on our trading volume.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had debt outstanding of $13.4 million in principal. In November 2022, we amended all of the outstanding 2015\nSubordinated Notes, extending the due date by two years to February 2025.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2023 were $106.3 million, a decrease of $87.1 million from December 31, 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents of our subsidiary, MiNK, at June 30, 2023, were $10.6 million. MiNK cash can only be accessed by Agenus through a declaration of\na dividend by the MiNK Board of Directors or through settlement of intercompany balances.\nBased on our current plans and projections, we believe that our cash resources of $106.3 million as of September 30, 2023, plus additional funding we\nanticipate from the achievement of a milestone under an existing partnership, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least one year from\nwhen these financial statements were issued. This milestone will be triggered upon dosing the first patient in a clinical trial which is currently screening patients\nand is expected to occur by end of 2023. However, until this event occurs, in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance we are required to disclose that\nsubstantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition to the expected milestone payment by end of 2023, we are in active discussions to sell two non-strategic assets expected to close in the first\nhalf of 2024 with an estimated aggregate value of approximately $65.0 million. These transactions could extend our cash resources well beyond 2024. We are\nalso in advanced discussions for a potential structured financing for botensilimab/balstilimab, as well as a potential corporate collaboration with a large pharma\nor biotech company. None of these sources of cash involve equity or debt issuance.\nManagement continues to address the Company’s liquidity position and has the flexibility to adjust spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity. In\nAugust 2023, we prioritized and focused our resources to accelerate the development, registration, and commercialization of our lead asset postponing all\npreclinical and other clinical programs and reducing our workforce by approximately 25%. Our CEO, Dr. Garo Armen has elected to receive his base salary and\nany potential bonus payments in stock rather than cash. We continuously evaluate the likelihood of success of our programs. As such, our decisions to continue\nto fund or eliminate funding of each of our programs are predicated on these determinations, on an ongoing basis. We expect our sources of funding to include\npayments from current collaborations which include milestones and royalty payments from companies, including BMS, UroGen, Gilead, Incyte, and Merck;\nout-licensing and/or partnering opportunities for our portfolio programs and product candidates with multiple parties; additional third-party agreements; asset\nsales; royalty monetization; project financing, and/or sales of equity securities.\nOur future cash requirements include, but are not limited to, supporting clinical trial and regulatory efforts and continuing our other research and\ndevelopment programs. Since inception, we have entered into various agreements with contract manufacturers, institutions, and clinical research organizations\n(collectively “third party providers”) to perform pre-clinical activities and to conduct and monitor our clinical studies and trials. Under these agreements,\nsubject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable third-party provider, we have estimated our total payments to be $601.3 million over the\nterm of the related activities. Through September 30, 2023, we have expensed $519.8 million as research and development expenses and $500.7 million has\nbeen paid under these agreements. The timing of expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements is subject to the\n23\nenrollment of patients and performance by the applicable third-party provider. We plan to enter into additional agreements with third party providers and we\nanticipate significant additional expenditures will be required to initiate and advance our various programs.\nPart of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing collaboration arrangements with\nacademic and collaboration partners and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. As a result of our collaboration agreements, we will not completely\ncontrol the efforts to attempt to bring those product candidates to market. For example, our collaboration with Incyte for the development, manufacture and\ncommercialization of CPM antibodies against certain targets is managed by a joint steering committee, which is controlled by Incyte.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $183.8 million and $128.0 million, respectively. Our\nfuture ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval and market acceptance of our product candidates, achieving\nbenchmarks as defined in existing collaboration agreements, and our ability to enter into new collaborations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Forward Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risks highlighted\nin Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is foreign currency exchange rate risk. International revenues and expenses are generally transacted by our foreign\nsubsidiaries and are denominated in local currency. Approximately 0.9% and 1.7% of our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, was from our foreign subsidiaries. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk\nrelated to our transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not currently employ specific strategies, such as the use of derivative instruments or\nhedging, to manage these exposures. Our currency exposures vary but are primarily concentrated in the British Pound, Euro, and Swiss Franc, in large part due\nto our subsidiaries, Agenus UK Limited and AgenTus Therapeutics Limited, both with operations in England, AgenTus Therapeutics SA, a company formerly\nwith operations in Belgium, and Agenus Switzerland a company formerly with operations in Switzerland.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2023 of $106.3 million, which are exposed to the impact of interest rate\nchanges, and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest\nrates as we seek debt financing and invest excess cash. Due to the short-term nature of our investments in money market funds and U.S. Treasury Bills, our\ncarrying value approximates the fair value of these investments at September 30, 2023.\nThere has been no material change to our interest rate exposure and our approach toward interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures, as\ndescribed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve\nprincipal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. We review our investment policy periodically and amend it as deemed\nnecessary. Currently, the investment policy prohibits investing in any structured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper. Although our\ninvestments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from\nany single issue, issuer, or type of investment. We do not invest in derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, we do not believe that there is currently any\nmaterial market risk exposure with respect to derivatives or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)\npromulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end\nof the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were designed to ensure that\ninformation we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. It should be\nnoted that any system of controls is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the system will achieve its stated goals under all\nreasonably foreseeable circumstances. Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have each concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective at a level that provides such reasonable assurances.\n24\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n25\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not party to any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of our 2022 Form 10-K, please note the\nadditional Risk Factor included below.\nSubstantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern\nWe have financed our operations through income and revenues generated from corporate partnerships, advance royalty sales and proceeds from equity\nissuances. Based on our current plans and projections, we believe that our cash resources of $106.3 million at September 30, 2023, plus additional funding we\nanticipate from the achievement of a milestone under an existing partnership, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least one year from\nwhen these financial statements were issued. This milestone will be triggered upon dosing the first patient in a clinical trial which is currently screening patients\nand is expected to occur by end of 2023. However, until this event occurs, in accordance with relevant accounting guidance we are required to disclose that\nsubstantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition to the expected milestone payment by end of 2023, we are in active discussions to sell two non-strategic assets expected to close in the first\nhalf of 2024 with an estimated aggregate value of approximately $65.0 million.
