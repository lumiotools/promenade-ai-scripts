If unchanged in November and December, these shipments would rise at a 0.5% annualized rate in Q4 versus the Q3 average. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not much, but it beats the declines in orders in both the second and third quarter this year, a clear sign that all is not well on the economic front. &nbsp;Meanwhile, overall orders for durable goods &ndash; both including and excluding transportation &ndash; are barely keeping pace with inflation. &nbsp;Change is on the horizon, with the Trump Administration heading back to Washington with a mandate to cut taxes, cut regulations, and trim the size of government. &nbsp;This will likely bring volatility to the data in the months ahead as business figure out how the new policy environment changes the outlook for investment and growth. &nbsp;In turn, the Federal Reserve will navigate what these changes mean for the path of inflation. &nbsp; The lagged effects of the Fed&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy are still working their way through the system, and the country hasn&rsquo;t fully weaned off the government&rsquo;s morphine-like stimulus response to COVID. &nbsp; Only time will tell how these opposing forces and ongoing geopolitical conflicts will play out in the year ahead. &nbsp;In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims fell 2,000 last week to 213,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims rose 9,000 to 1.907 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/27/new-orders-for-durable-goods-rose-0.2percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:26:47 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/new-orders-for-durable-goods-rose-0.2percent-in-october Personal Income Rose 0.6% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/personal-income-rose-0.6percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=86dc6c02-c5fe-440f-8467-ac27a785db07' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Strong income gains heading into the holiday season give consumers something to be thankful for. &nbsp;Personal income rose 0.6% in October and is up 5.3% in the past year. &nbsp;Private-sector wages and salaries led the way, up 0.5% on the month and up 5.5% in the past year. &nbsp;Unfortunately, government activity continues to run hot as well, as government pay also rose 0.5% in October and is up 6.3% in the past year, hovering near the largest twelve-month increase in decades. At the same time, government benefit payments to individuals are up 7.8% and are accelerating in the past year, the largest 12-month increase (excluding the COVID stimulus period) in more than a decade. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t think the growth in government pay &ndash; or massive government deficit spending &ndash; is either sustainable or good for the US economy. &nbsp;On the spending side, consumption rose 0.4% in October, led by outlays on services which increased 0.5% on the month and are up 7.0% in the past year. &nbsp;Goods spending was unchanged in October and up a more modest 2.0% from a year ago. &nbsp;That said, a lot October spending growth came as a result of higher prices. &nbsp;PCE prices, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.2% in October, so when adjusting for inflation, consumption rose just 0.1% in October. &nbsp;PCE prices are up 2.3% in the past year, compared to a 3.0% increase in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;&ldquo;Core&rdquo; prices, which exclude the ever-volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.3% in October and are up 2.8% versus a year ago, an improvement from the 3.4% reading for the twelve months ending October 2023. &nbsp;But while year-ago comparisons have improved, it&rsquo;s important to note that the pace of inflation in October &ndash; both headline and core &ndash; still represents prices rising at a faster than 2.0% annualized rate. While the Fed believes they have room to continue cutting rates in the meetings ahead, the battle against inflation has not been won, and risks remain that an overly aggressive path of cuts could bring with them a pickup in the M2 measure of money, and with it a return of more inflation pressure. &nbsp;On the housing front, pending home sales, which are contracts on existing homes, rose 2.0% in October following a 7.5% surge in September. Plugging these figures into our model suggests existing home sales, which are counted at closing, will rise in November, although they&rsquo;ll remain low by historical standards.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/27/personal-income-rose-0.6percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:12:36 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/personal-income-rose-0.6percent-in-october Real GDP Growth in Q3 Was Unrevised at a 2.8% Annual Rate https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=cb00d654-908d-4293-8111-4e2ea5ba7eba' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Hold off on GDP for a moment. &nbsp;The most important data in this morning&rsquo;s report was on economy-wide corporate profits, which declined 0.3% in the third quarter vs. the second quarter, although still up 6.1% from a year ago. &nbsp;Profits from the rest of the world, which dropped 8.0%, led the decline in Q3 itself. Profits from domestic industries rose 0.8% from the previous quarter. &nbsp;Profit figures on the financial industry include the Federal Reserve and because the Fed pays private banks interest on reserves it has been generating unprecedented losses in recent quarters. &nbsp;Excluding the losses at the Fed (because we want to accurately count profits in the private sector), overall corporate profits were unchanged in the third quarter and up 4.8% from a year ago. &nbsp;Plugging in non-Fed profits into our Capitalized Profits Model suggests stocks remain overvalued. Looking at the other details of today&rsquo;s report, second quarter real GDP was unrevised at 2.8%. &nbsp;A small downward revision in spending on goods offset a small upward gain in business investment in research &amp; development. To focus on sustainable growth drivers, we follow \"core\" GDP, which includes consumer spending, business fixed investment, and home building, while excluding government purchases, inventories, and international trade, which are too volatile for long-term growth. &ldquo;Core&rdquo; GDP increased at a 3.2% annual rate in Q3. We also got a first look at the Q3 total for Real Gross Domestic Income, an alternative to GDP that is just as accurate. Real GDI rose at a 2.2% annual rate in Q3 and is up 3.1% versus a year ago. &nbsp;In other words, GDI suggests today&rsquo;s report on Q3 may overstate growth a little. &nbsp;On the inflation front, the GDP price index was revised slightly higher to a 1.9% annual rate in Q3 versus a prior estimate of 1.8% and up 2.2% from a year ago, hovering close to the Fed&rsquo;s target. &nbsp;In other news yesterday, the Federal Reserve released monthly figures on M2, showing it up 0.4% in October and up 3.1% in the past year. &nbsp;M2 surged during COVID, then declined from early 2022 through early 2023. &nbsp;It has stopped declining, but isn&rsquo;t rising rapidly, which should put continued downward pressure on the growth rate of inflation and nominal GDP in the year ahead.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:58:17 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate New Single-Family Home Sales Declined 17.3% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=b17c7af8-21d2-474c-b143-918ca3985c6d' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;New home sales posted the largest monthly decline since 2013 in October, coming in well below consensus expectations and hitting the slowest pace in two years. &nbsp;However, it looks like this was a result of one-off factors surrounding Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which temporarily delayed sales. The southern region, which is the largest in the US, was almost solely responsible for the decline in October and took the brunt of the extreme weather. Keep in mind that new home sales are a timelier barometer of the housing market because they are calculated when contracts are signed, while existing homes are only counted after the sale is closed, so we saw the impacts here first and will likely see a rebound in the months ahead. That said, the housing market continues to face other challenges. While thirty-year fixed mortgage rates were falling in the lead up to the initial Fed rate cut announcement in September, that has reversed with rates back above 7%. One piece of good news for potential buyers is that, even though prices are up in the past year, the median sales price of new homes is down 5% from the peak in 2022. It does look like a small part of this decline reflects a lower price per square foot as developers cut prices. &nbsp;The Census Bureau reports that from 2022 to 2023 (the most recent data available) the median price per square foot for single family homes sold fell 1.1%. While that decline is modest, it represents a stark reversal from the 45% gain from 2019 to 2022. &nbsp;That said, most of the drop in median prices is likely due to the mix of homes on the market including more lower priced options as developers complete smaller properties. Supply has also put more downward pressure on median prices for new homes than existing homes. &nbsp;The supply of completed single-family homes is up over 265% versus the bottom in 2022. This contrasts with the market for existing homes which continues to struggle with an inventory problem, often due to the difficulty of convincing current homeowners to give up the low fixed-rate mortgages they locked-in during the pandemic. &nbsp;While the future cost of financing remains a question, lower prices and an abundance of inventories are giving potential buyers a wider array of options will eventually help fuel a rebound in new home sales. In other housing news this morning, home prices rose in September, with the national Case-Shiller index up 0.3% and the FHFA index jumping 0.7%. &nbsp;In the last twelve months, these indices are up 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively. &nbsp;On the manufacturing front, the Richmond Fed index remained unchanged at -14 in November, highlighting ongoing weakness in that sector.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:10:07 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october Three on Thursday - Is There Room to Cut?

While the headline gain of 3.4% is positive news, sales activity still remains near the slowest pace since the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis. One problem recently is that since Federal Reserve rate cuts began in September, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have risen back above 7%. So at least so far, the widely anticipated shot in the arm to the housing market from improved affordability hasn&rsquo;t happened and buyers continue to sit on the fence. Meanwhile, home prices are rising again with the median price of an existing home up 4.0% from a year ago. While most of the housing market remains stuck in low gear, certain segments have shown signs of life. Notably, sales of homes priced at $1 million and above have risen 23.0% in the past year versus just 2.9% for all existing home sales. This demonstrates that, at least at the higher end of the market, both buyers and sellers are beginning to adjust to the new reality of higher rates. However, outside the most expensive segment many existing homeowners remain reluctant to sell due to a &ldquo;mortgage lock-in&rdquo; phenomenon, after buying or refinancing at much lower rates before 2022. &nbsp;This remains a major impediment to activity by limiting future existing sales (and inventories). &nbsp;However, there are signs of progress with inventories rising 19.1% in the past year. &nbsp;That has helped push the months&rsquo; supply of homes (how long it would take to sell existing inventory at the current very slow sales pace) to 4.2 in September, a considerable improvement versus the past few years, but still below the benchmark of 5.0 that the National Association of Realtors uses to denote a normal market. &nbsp; A tight inventory of existing homes means that while the pace of sales looks like 2008, we aren&rsquo;t seeing that translate to a big decline in prices. &nbsp;In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims fell 6,000 last week to 213,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims rose 36,000 to 1.908 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year. Finally, on the manufacturing front, the Philadelphia Fed Index, a measure of factory sentiment in that region, fell to -5.5 in November from +10.3 in October.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/21/existing-home-sales-increased-3.4percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:05:29 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/21/existing-home-sales-increased-3.4percent-in-october Housing Starts Declined 3.1% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=bc368593-1517-4614-86ac-970ef84bb1e8' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Homebuilding was weak in October, but not quite as bad as it looked. &nbsp;Overall housing starts missed consensus expectations and declined 3.1%, entirely due to a 6.9% drop in the single-family category. &nbsp;Looking at the details, construction in the South (the region with the largest share of homebuilding in the country) led the way downward with an 8.8% decline, as homebuilders in that region delayed activity in wake of hurricanes that swept through the area. &nbsp;Still, housing starts appear to be stuck in low-gear, down 4.0% from a year ago, and sit at roughly the same levels as 2019. &nbsp;The same cannot be said for completions. &nbsp;Despite a 4.4% drop for the month, completions were at a faster pace than any month in 2021-2023 and are up 16.8% in the past year. &nbsp;With strong completion activity and tepid growth in starts, the total number of homes under construction continues to fall, now down 12.7% since the start of 2024. &nbsp;That type of decline is usually associated with a housing bust or recession. &nbsp;The lack of new construction is why home prices have remained elevated while rents are still heading up in much of the country: we are building too few homes while lax enforcement of immigration laws mean rapid population growth. &nbsp;The home building sector seems strangely slow given our population growth and the ongoing need to scrap older homes due to disasters or for knockdowns. We think government rules and regulations are likely the major hurdle for builders in much of the country, but home construction might also be facing headwinds from a low unemployment rate (which makes it hard to find workers) as well as relatively high mortgage rates. &nbsp;Notably, while mortgage rates were trending lower leading up to the first rate cut announcement from the Federal Reserve in September, these rates are up more than 50bps since then. That said, there are some tailwinds for housing construction, as well. &nbsp;Many owners of existing homes are hesitant to sell and give up their fixed sub-3% mortgage rates, so prospective buyers will often need new builds. &nbsp;In addition, Millennials are now the largest living generation in the US and have begun to enter the housing market in force, which represents a demographic tailwind for activity. &nbsp;Putting it together, we don&rsquo;t see housing as a major driver of economic growth in the near term, but we&rsquo;re not expecting a housing bust like the 2000s on the way, either. &nbsp;In other recent housing news, the NAHB Housing Index (a measure of homebuilder sentiment) rose to 46 in November from 43 in October. &nbsp;However, a reading below 50 signals a greater number of builders view conditions as poor versus good.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:04:27 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october Don’t Forget the Lags https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/18/dont-forget-the-lags <p>In our lifetimes, the best comparison for Trump&rsquo;s election win is Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s in 1980. &nbsp;That election, like this one, pitted big spenders and champions of government against tax cutters and critics of government.</p> <p>It is pretty clear that markets approved of both winning campaigns as they were happening. &nbsp;Leading up to the election in 1980, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 rallied as it became clearer that Reagan (like Trump) was likely to win. &nbsp;The market also rallied in the days following the election because markets like tax cuts, deregulation, and restrained government. &nbsp;And, at the same time, the policies the markets didn&rsquo;t like &ndash; such as a tax on unrealized capital gains &ndash; were now dead.</p> <p>But after being euphoric at the outcome of the election in 1980, reality set in. &nbsp;Paul Volcker was fighting inflation with tight money, a recession was inevitable and tax cuts took time to pass. &nbsp;The S&amp;P 500 fell in 1981 and in the first eight months of 1982 before the Reagan bull market really started.</p> <p>History doesn&rsquo;t repeat itself, but at times it rhymes. And while there are similarities between today and 1981, there are also some key differences. &nbsp;For example, the Federal Reserve is now cutting interest rates, not raising them. &nbsp;However, there are some big differences that investors need to pay attention to. &nbsp;First, in October 1980, the Price-Earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 was 8.6. &nbsp;In October 2024, the PE ratio was 27. &nbsp;In other words, while the market may appreciate better policies, it sure looks like they are already priced in.</p> <p>Moreover, while Trump is selecting his cabinet rapidly and his team has likely already done the homework needed to move fast on executive orders that can boost growth, much of the real work will take time. &nbsp;It appears Congress wants to move fast, but it is still Congress and that means it&rsquo;s messy.</p> <p>Reagan cut tax rates across the board, Trump plans to maintain most current tax rates with some small changes, and promised to eliminate taxes on tips, social security, and overtime. &nbsp;These tax cuts are welcome, but they are not true supply-side tax cuts&hellip;the ones that boost entrepreneurship and innovation.</p> <p>The really powerful potential of the Trump plans will come from DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, where Musk and Ramaswamy plan on proposing big cuts to the fourth branch of government &ndash; the Bureaucrats. &nbsp;Every regulation that they can cut, every bureaucrat that they can keep from gumming up the private sector, will boost productivity.</p> <p>But in addition to cutting red tape, the US must cut the absolute size of government. &nbsp;John Maynard Keynes wanted deficit spending ended after a crisis was over. &nbsp;But, after both the Panic of 2008 and COVID, the US kept spending elevated. &nbsp;Government spending has risen from 19.1% of GDP in 2007 to 23.4% this year. &nbsp;Government is a ball and chain on the economy. &nbsp;We estimate that every one percentage point increase of spending as a share of GDP reduces underlying real GDP growth by 0.2%.</p> <p>Every dollar the government spends is taken from the private sector, and the government taxes and borrows nearly 5% more of GDP today than it did seventeen years ago. &nbsp;From 1990 through 2007, real GDP grew 3% per year. &nbsp;From 2008 through the second quarter of 2024, real GDP has only grown 2% per year. &nbsp;No wonder &ldquo;the economy&rdquo; was the #1 factor for Americans in this election. &nbsp;Two percent annual growth is stagnation.</p> <p>And this shouldn&rsquo;t be happening according to fans of big government. &nbsp;Economists like Mark Zandi and Paul Krugman support government spending and argue that it has a positive multiplier ($1 of government spending creates more than $1 of GDP). &nbsp;Add this to the fact that the US has invented unbelievably productive new technologies in the last 17 years, and the economy should be booming. &nbsp;Especially with the Fed holding rates at zero for nine of those years.</p> <p>But it hasn&rsquo;t, and the reason is that government is just too darn big. &nbsp;Cutting government spending is a double-edged sword. &nbsp;Half of all job growth in the past year has been in government jobs directly, as well as healthcare which is dominated by government. &nbsp;Taking away that spending will initially slow job growth, but, with a lag, eventually boost economic activity.</p> <p>In other words, the Trump Administration has a chance to boost underlying economic growth rates, and that would be extremely positive for living standards and equity values over the long-term. &nbsp;But initially, it may result in slower growth. &nbsp;The US had a car wreck with COVID. &nbsp;Easy money from the Fed and big deficits were like morphine. &nbsp;The US is addicted to short-term fixes that do nothing to boost long-term growth. &nbsp;Withdrawal from the pain killers hurts, but is necessary to get truly healthy.</p> <p>While we are extremely positive about the long-term benefits of policy changes, like under Reagan, weaning the US from massively easy fiscal policies does not guarantee overnight success. &nbsp;It will take time, and the US will come through to the other side stronger. &nbsp;The entire world will benefit&hellip;with a lag.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

Looking at the details in today&rsquo;s report, the weakness was concentrated in manufacturing, with activity falling 0.5%. &nbsp;Production in the volatile auto sector dropped 3.1% while non-auto manufacturing (which we think of as a &ldquo;core&rdquo; version of industrial production) posted a more modest decline of 0.3% in October. &nbsp;The only bright spot in this &ldquo;core&rdquo; measure came from production in high-tech equipment which rose 0.6% in October, likely the result of investment in AI as well as the reshoring of semiconductor production. &nbsp;High-tech manufacturing is up at a 10.0% annualized rate in the past three months and 7.6% in the past year, the fastest for any major category. &nbsp;The mining sector was also healthy in October, rising 0.3%. &nbsp;Higher production of oil and gas more than offset a decline in the drilling of new wells and the extraction of other minerals and metals. &nbsp;Finally, the utilities sector (which is volatile and largely dependent on weather) also posted an increase in October, rising 0.7%. &nbsp;In other manufacturing news this morning, the Empire State Index, which measures manufacturing sentiment in the New York region, surged unexpectedly to +31.2 in November from -11.9 in October.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/15/industrial-production-declined-0.3percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Fri, 15 Nov 2024 20:18:35 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/industrial-production-declined-0.3percent-in-october Retail Sales Rose 0.4% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=3221999b-929a-4e2b-8c3d-752604e2c674' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp; Despite years of higher prices, consumers continue to buy. &nbsp;Retail sales rose 0.4% in October versus a consensus expected increase of 0.3%, while prior months&rsquo; activity was revised higher, bringing the overall gain to 0.6%. &nbsp;Looking at the details, eight out of thirteen major sales categories rose in October. &nbsp;Overall activity was boosted by a 1.6% increase for autos. &nbsp;Stripping this out, sales were up a meager 0.1%. &nbsp;Taking out the two other often-volatile categories of gas stations and building materials, &ldquo;core&rdquo; sales (the most important group for measuring GDP) were unchanged for the month. &nbsp;Within the core sales grouping, restaurants and bars led the way, rising 0.7% following an upwardly revised 1.2% jump in the previous month. &nbsp;While healthy growth, the 4.3% increase in restaurant and bar sales in the last year represents a slowing from the 8.6% advance in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;We will be watching this category closely since it is the only glimpse we get at services in the retail sales report, which suffered heavily during the COVID years but have since returned to the forefront of the US consumer. &nbsp;Partially offsetting gains in October were declining sales for health &amp; personal care stores (-1.1%) and miscellaneous store retailers (-1.6%). &nbsp;As a whole, retail sales are up 2.8% on a year-to-year basis, barely keeping pace with inflation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Real&rdquo; inflation-adjusted retail sales are up 0.3% in the past year and still down from the peak in early 2022. &nbsp;This highlights the ugly ramifications of inflation: consumers are paying higher prices today but taking home fewer goods than they were two years ago. &nbsp;And while the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week and looks likely to cut again in December, it is not at all clear that inflation problems are behind us. &nbsp;Case in point, import prices rose 0.3% and export prices jumped 0.8% in October versus a consensus expected decline of 0.1% for both. &nbsp;We hope they have the resolve to stomp out the embers of inflation even if economic troubles come.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:19:26 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october Downsizing the Bureaucracy Won't Crash the Economy https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/downsizing-the-bureaucracy-wont-crash-the-economy <p>The new Trump Administration hasn&rsquo;t wasted any time since last week&rsquo;s election win, with new information around economic policy and staffing appointments making news on a daily basis. In our opinion, the recent announcement of a new Department of Government Efficiency or &ldquo;DOGE&rdquo; headed by Elon Musk (who obviously came up with this name and acronym) and Vivek Ramaswamy, has been the most important so far.</p> <p>As we mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/11/mandate-for-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monday&rsquo;s piece</a>, both these individuals have been making the rounds on various podcasts, before and since Election Day, speaking about plans to not only cut unnecessary regulation, but also potentially move agencies out of D.C. and downsize the headcount of the Federal bureaucracy by up to 50%. For context that would be the biggest reduction in headcount since the aftermath of WW2 as the US demobilized from the war effort. &nbsp;Like everything in politics there are those who oppose these ideas. &nbsp;One argument in opposition is that mass layoffs in Washington put the US economy at risk for a recession. We think this worry is misplaced.</p> <p>The current Federal Government workforce (excluding the military) is roughly 3.0 million. Meanwhile, total employment in the US is around 160 million. We currently have 7 million unemployed individuals bringing the unemployment rate to 4.1%, a relatively low rate historically and one that hasn&rsquo;t caused the US economy to stop growing. If the &ldquo;DOGE&rdquo; were successful in firing 50% of Federal employees, total unemployment would rise to 8.5 million and the unemployment rate would increase to just 5.0%.</p> <p>If these job losses were all in the private sector, say in construction, it would lead to less production and a potential housing shortage. But, if these job losses are in bureaucracies that often interfere with production, then growth may actually accelerate. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get us wrong, we aren&rsquo;t against stop lights and speed limits, and we don&rsquo;t want to wait even longer to get our tax refund. But, a lot of government can be streamlined and automated. Moreover, these bureaucrats love to add pages to the Federal Register (a good proxy for total regulation). &nbsp;Today, total pages of regulation have rebounded to near a record high.</p> <p>Further, the vast majority of these workers will find work in the private sector, where free markets more efficiently allocate resources. These are well educated individuals with lots of potentially valuable skills that aren&rsquo;t being fully utilized. The unemployment rate for people with a college degree or higher in the US is currently just 2.5%. These former bureaucrats would be able to find new jobs relatively quickly and this reallocation of talent would be an asset to future growth and innovation. And throughout the process, generous severances packages would give workers ample coverage while they find new work.</p> <p>The reality is that the government has gotten too darn big. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulation costs the US economy roughly $2 trillion a year. Add in Federal, State and Local spending and over 50% of the US economy is at the whim of the bureaucracy. This puts a wet blanket on innovation, with companies spending countless hours, dollars, and intellectual manpower trying to comply with rules and regulations, rather than applying those resources toward new and innovative ways to improve consumers&rsquo; quality of life. One clear example of this economic distortion, the Wall Street Journal recently reported 40% of the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalization is being investigated by the Department of Justice, while the Department of Wildlife is interfering with the launch of rockets. &nbsp;The real question is if we can afford not to address this growing problem, and we find it very encouraging that leadership is finally taking the issue seriously.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

One of his newly appointed advisors, Elon Musk, has proposed the ambitious goal of cutting at least $2 trillion from the federal budget, aiming to bring greater efficiency to government operations. While Musk&rsquo;s track record of innovation and cost cutting suggests he might be up to the challenge, reducing nearly a third of federal spending will neither be easy or universally popular. In this edition of &ldquo;Three on Thursday&rdquo;, we take a broad look at federal spending.&nbsp;</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/14/three-on-thursday----is-there-room-to-cut-examining-federal-spending-pt-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to view the report</p> Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:53:18 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/three-on-thursday---is-there-room-to-cut-examining-federal-spending-part-1 The Producer Price Index (PPI) Rose 0.2% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=8073fe05-96a9-423a-9006-9d59e3438e12' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;While the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week and looks likely to cut again in December, it is not at all clear that inflation problems are behind us. &nbsp;Producer prices rose 0.2% in October, despite declines in food and energy prices, which fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. &nbsp;These categories have played an outsized role in the slower inflation readings of recent months, but when you strip out these historically volatile components, &ldquo;core&rdquo; producer prices rose 0.3% in October and are up 3.1% in the past year, an acceleration from the 2.2% reading for the twelve months ending October 2023. &nbsp;Diving into the details of today&rsquo;s report shows service prices led the core index higher, rising 0.3% in October and up 3.5% in the past year. &nbsp;The October increase in services was broad based, with all major categories showing higher prices. &nbsp;Prices for goods rose 0.1% in October and are up a modest 0.2% from a year ago. &nbsp;Within goods, rising costs for steel scrap, meats, and diesel fuel more than offset an 18.1% decline in liquified petroleum gas prices. &nbsp;Further back in the supply chain, prices in October rose 0.5% for intermediate demand processed goods and 4.1% for unprocessed goods, but prices in both categories are down in the past year. &nbsp;The direction of inflation moving forward is very likely to be dictated by 1) the services side of the economy, which suffered heavily during the COVID shutdowns but has since returned to the forefront and 2) changes in the money supply, which, after surging in 2020-21, peaked in early 2022. Although the M2 measure of money has been rising gradually since last October, it&rsquo;s still down 2.3% from the peak in April 2022. &nbsp;Too little growth in the money supply means continued downward pressure on both inflation and economic growth. &nbsp;We will be watching the path of M2 growth closely as the Fed continues cutting rates. A sharp resurgence in M2 growth would bring with it the risk of accelerating inflation. Does the Fed have the patience to ease at a slow and steady pace, or will they overreact to any signs of economic trouble? Only time will tell, but the stakes are high, and the Fed&rsquo;s record is less than pristine. &nbsp;On the labor front this morning, initial jobless claims fell 4,000 last week to 217,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims declined 11,000 to 1.873 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:00:25 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october The Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rose 0.2% in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=79d3e762-11bc-4bd7-a3e6-6fe56dcb0a8a' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp; Inflation came in as expected in October but remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2.0% mandate, warning investors that the inflation story is not over. &nbsp;Headline prices rose 0.2% in October (+3.0% annualized) while the twelve-month reading rose for the first time in six months to 2.6%. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth noting that lately inflation has been held down by declining energy prices, which were unchanged in October but are down 4.9% in the last year. &nbsp;Excluding energy, prices are up 3.2% in the last year. Stripping out the often-volatile category as well as food prices (+0.2% in October) to get &ldquo;core&rdquo; prices shows that measure rose 0.3% in October (+3.4% annualized), while the year-ago comparison remained at 3.3%. &nbsp;The main driver of core inflation has been housing rents, which rose 0.4% and have shown little to no sign of slowing. &nbsp;Some analysts &ndash; including those at the Fed &ndash; have argued that housing rents have artificially boosted the inflation picture due to the way it&rsquo;s measured and the lags at which those changes are reflected in the monthly reports. &nbsp;But a subset category of prices the Fed used to tell investors to watch closely but no longer seems to mention &ndash; known as the &ldquo;Supercore&rdquo; &ndash; which excludes food, energy, other goods, and housing rents, rose 0.3% in October and are up 4.4% in the last year, worse than the 3.7% reading in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;No matter which way you cut it, inflation is still running above the Fed&rsquo;s 2.0% target, now for the 44th consecutive month. &nbsp;We have said for some time that easing in inflation will come should the Fed have the resolve to let the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy do its work. &nbsp;But the Fed has now cut rates a total of 75bps since September. &nbsp;And yet the embers of inflation continue burning. &nbsp;Since we have yet to see a significant or prolonged slowdown in growth, much less a recession, it remains to be seen whether inflation will reach 2.0% or less on a consistent basis. &nbsp;This month&rsquo;s report did no favors proving that.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:04:28 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october The Fed’s Challenge https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/11/the-feds-challenge <p>The Federal Reserve cut short-term rates by a quarter percentage point last week, like pretty much everyone expected. &nbsp;In addition, the Fed didn&rsquo;t push back hard against market expectations of another quarter-point cut in mid-December, so unless the economic or financial news changes dramatically by then, expect a repeat at the next meeting.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why the Fed has been cutting rates. &nbsp;The consumer price index is up 2.4% in the past year versus a 3.7% gain in the year-ending in September 2023. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the PCE deflator, which the Fed uses for its official 2.0% inflation target, is only up 2.1% in the past year while it was up 3.4% in the year ending in September 2023.</p> <p>However, in spite of getting into the Red Zone versus inflation, the Fed isn&rsquo;t yet in the End Zone, and it looks like progress has recently stalled. &nbsp;According to the Atlanta Fed, the CPI is projected to be up 2.7% in the year ending this November while PCE prices should be up 2.5%.</p> <p>It's also important to recognize that a few years ago the Fed itself devised a measure it called Supercore inflation, which excludes food, energy, all other goods, and housing. &nbsp;That measure of prices is still up 4.3% versus a year ago, which is probably why the Fed has stopped talking about it.</p> <p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that there&rsquo;s a huge gulf between the policy implications of the Fed reaching its 2.0% inflation goal and the public&rsquo;s perception of inflation no longer being a problem. &nbsp;Right or wrong, for now, the public seems to think that for inflation to no longer be a problem prices would have to go back down to where they were pre-COVID.</p> <p>But that&rsquo;s not going to happen. &nbsp;The federal government spent like drunken sailors during COVID and the Fed helped accommodate that spending by allowing the M2 measure of the money supply to soar. &nbsp;M2 is off the peak it hit in early 2022, but it would take a much greater reduction than so far experienced to restore prices as they were almost five years ago.</p> <p>Instead, getting to 2.0% inflation means eventually accepting not only that prices aren&rsquo;t going back to where they were but they&rsquo;re going to keep rising, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p>And remember, even that goal has so far remained elusive. &nbsp;The embers of inflation continue burning. &nbsp;And since we have yet to see a significant or prolonged slowdown in growth, much less a recession, it remains to be seen whether inflation will reach 2.0% or less on a consistent basis.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the Fed&rsquo;s inflation goal remains elusive. &nbsp;In turn, that means don&rsquo;t be surprised if the Fed pauses rate cuts early next year.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to find a nook or cranny of human activity not impacted by government money, taxes and regulations.</p> <p>In the first 219 years of its history the federal government grew from nothing to a budget of $3 trillion. &nbsp;In the 16 years since then, because of the Financial Panic of 2008 and COVID, government spending more than doubled to $6.75 trillion. &nbsp;These were emergencies (and we disagreed with all that spending), but after an emergency you&rsquo;d expect spending to return to pre-emergency levels. &nbsp;But history shows politicians never let a crisis go to waste, and their power and spending just rachets higher. &nbsp;Instead of going toward new innovations, those resources have been building bigger bureaucracies and have pushed hundreds of billions into Green New Deal initiatives.</p> <p>The insanity of spending this much to force the economy in a direction picked by politicians isn&rsquo;t lost on businesses. &nbsp;When Google, Microsoft, and Meta need electricity for their new AI factories, where do they go? &nbsp;Nuclear power, which the government has ignored. &nbsp;Government doesn&rsquo;t treat taxpayer resources well. &nbsp;It never has and it never will. &nbsp;Only when it is their own money do people care how it is spent.</p> <p>And all this spending has created an insatiable desire to tax at the federal, state and local levels. &nbsp;Combine taxes with inflation and no wonder savings rates are so low and 70% of those polled say the economy is not working for them. &nbsp;Hearing President Trump support tax cuts for tips, social security and overtime is music to hard-working-American&rsquo;s ears.</p> <p>Given all this, and the fact that there is a mandate for action, many are wondering what is likely to happen. &nbsp;First, it is clear that if the Trump team goes in with a milquetoast agenda, tweaking spending here, tax rates there, and gets involved with political horse trading, the victory will be wasted. &nbsp;The Trump team needs to take a page from the Javier Milei playbook. &nbsp;Go fast and go big. &nbsp;But it needs to be done with the understanding that some things will pay off quickly and others will take time.</p> <p>The stock market has soared since the election results were finalized, suggesting that investors believe a Trump presidency is good for the economy. &nbsp;However, it could also be that the market is reacting to the fact that the worst policies of a Harris presidency, like taxes on unrealized gains, or interfering with large tech companies and maybe Elon Musk directly, won&rsquo;t happen. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably a little bit of both, and if Trump follows the right policies, he can help the market build on these gains.</p> <p>Below is a list of things we would suggest the Trump team focus on and attempt to legislate. &nbsp;None of this is easy&hellip;but, from our point of view all of it would be positive for America.</p> <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve never met a tax cut we didn&rsquo;t like. &nbsp;The Trump tax cuts from 2017 should be extended permanently and cutting taxes on tips, social security, and overtime all sound like great ideas to us.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close DEI offices in every government agency and office, most importantly the military. &nbsp;Follow the lead of Boeing, the University of North Carolina, the University of Florida, Tractor Supply, and many others who found that DEI goals undermine their institutions. &nbsp;Go woke and go broke. &nbsp;Believe in meritocracy and win. &nbsp;The biggest problem is that failures by government bureaucracies aren&rsquo;t as visible as they are in companies that compete in a market. &nbsp;There is no profit and loss statement for government. &nbsp;But getting rid of DEI will immediately improve these agencies. &nbsp;The military may finally hit its recruitment goals.</p> <p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Put universities and colleges on the hook for 50% of every student loan. &nbsp;If a student can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t repay after getting a degree from an institution of higher learning, it needs to be responsible for at least half of it. &nbsp;Just watch how quickly schools start pushing students toward degrees that are actually valuable in the real world. &nbsp;Student loans pay activist professors to train more activists. &nbsp;What a massive waste of resources it is to train people to play politics.</p> <p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Build a wall. &nbsp;Close the border. &nbsp;Deport criminals. &nbsp;But, also, create a system for making legal immigration easier. &nbsp;Make certain that new immigrants get a job and are not allowed to sign up for welfare, or any government handouts, for five years. &nbsp;In America&rsquo;s great immigration of the late 1800s and early 1900s, we put our arms around people and said, &ldquo;welcome to America, good luck.&rdquo; &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;welcome to America, here&rsquo;s a check.&rdquo;</p> <p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deregulate, deregulate, deregulate. &nbsp;Cut, cut, cut. &nbsp;Evidently Elon Musk may be named the head of DOGE. &nbsp;Department of Government Efficiency. &nbsp;Musk fired 80% of the staff at Twitter when he bought it, and it operates better than ever. &nbsp;Why? Because those people he fired were there to use Twitter as a political weapon, not to build the best news platform in the world. &nbsp;It is highly likely that years of lousy productivity growth in government has created a situation where at least 50% of the three million government employees are unnecessary. &nbsp;Musk shared an idea with Joe Rogan on his podcast that maybe we just send people home and, yet, still pay them. &nbsp;Total government payroll is likely around $300 billion per year. &nbsp;Spending $150 billion (half the payroll) to pay 50% of all bureaucrats to not come to work, and not cause problems for Americans who are just trying to get ahead, would likely increase productivity by way more than $150 billion per year. &nbsp;So, if it becomes hard to slim down bureaucracies because of union work rules, don&rsquo;t fire them, just have them turn in their credentials, computer, and phone. &nbsp;Send them home.</p> <p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asset managers should no longer be able to vote shares in the companies that their clients actually own. &nbsp;Centralized power, in the hands of asset managers, should not be able to be used to bully other companies into behaving in a way that only a few people think is appropriate. &nbsp;Give voting power back to the actual owners of the shares. &nbsp;Decentralize and put the days of ESG behind us.</p> <p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drill, baby, drill.</p> <p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cut spending. &nbsp;Start with Green New Deal subsidies. &nbsp;When companies like Google, Microsoft and Meta choose nuclear, it&rsquo;s a sign. &nbsp;Let all these clean industries compete in a fair and balanced marketplace and see who the winner is. &nbsp;If solar and wind are so fantastic&hellip;prove it by taking away the subsidies. &nbsp;Stop subsidizing primary education from Washington DC. &nbsp;Primary education is a local issue, and funding from DC is used to prop up teachers&rsquo; unions which fought to keep schools closed during COVID and constantly impede attempts to get vouchers. &nbsp;These fund transfers from the federal government to state governments are propping up bankrupt cities and states. &nbsp;These states need to face reality, and not be bailed out.</p> <p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Financial Panic of 2008 and COVID pushed federal spending from 19% of GDP to nearly 24% of GDP. &nbsp;The US has never balanced its federal budget with spending over 18.5% of GDP no matter what tax rates are put in place. &nbsp;Even John Maynard Keynes &ndash; father of deficit spending &ndash; would argue that once the crisis is over, deficit spending needs to stop. &nbsp;The US should make every attempt it can to take spending back to 2007 levels. &nbsp;Not in actual dollar terms (we have experienced a lot of inflation), but in percentage of GDP terms. &nbsp;So, how is that done? One way is what we referred to in Point 8 above, but spending cuts are easily demagogued and are often unpopular&hellip;so let&rsquo;s propose a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; on spending at 2024 overall levels. &nbsp;If the US froze spending for seven years, the budget would be balanced. &nbsp;In other words, the US could put in place a process by which we could actually see surpluses in 2031&hellip;which will be necessary because that is just about the time Social Security starts running red ink.</p> <p>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Federal Reserve has a classic bureaucratic mission creep problem going on. &nbsp;For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has a Community Development Department that highlights &ldquo;childcare&rdquo; and &ldquo;lead water pipes&rdquo; on its website. &nbsp;Economics encompasses every part of life, so the Fed argues all of this is within its purview. &nbsp;It also believes it should be involved in fighting &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; by saying weather issues could turn into financial, economic, and banking issues. &nbsp;But the Fed has only one job and that is maintaining the sanctity and value of the US dollar, and 40-year highs in inflation are proof that it has failed. &nbsp;The Fed needs to stop the activism. &nbsp;Moreover, the Federal Reserve, because of its move to abundant reserves, is losing about $100 billion dollars per year. &nbsp;So, how does it pay its employees? &nbsp;It appears that it is borrowing money from the Treasury. And to do this it uses an absurd accounting gimmick called a &ldquo;deferred asset&rdquo; &ndash; basically a promise to make profits in the future. &nbsp;We do not believe Congress approved this use of taxpayer funds to pay for Fed employees (especially ones that are behaving more like activists than monetary policy experts). &nbsp;There is a potential court case here using the Loper decision (repeal of Chevron) as its basis. &nbsp;The Treasury should not be paying for Fed losses. &nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the same issue has occurred with the Bank of England, but the UK counts this loss and the resulting spending as part of its deficit. &nbsp;That is the right way to do it, but accounting gimmicks in the US hide this from the public, and Congress.</p> <p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without going into all the details, the Trump Administration should push the Fed to return to a &ldquo;scarce reserve&rdquo; model. &nbsp;The Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet has grown from roughly $800 billion in 2007 to over $7 trillion today, 90% added in just 17 years. &nbsp;Government entities across the board used 2008 and COVID to expand their power, reach, and control in alarming ways. &nbsp;This all needs to be pushed back. &nbsp;Government should never be this big and powerful. &nbsp;The 2008 panic started with about $400 billion in losses on subprime loans. &nbsp;Today, banks have over half a trillion in losses on their books because of the way the Fed responded to those crises. &nbsp;In other words, the Fed has made the system less secure and stable, not more. &nbsp;End Quantitative Easing and roll back the Fed.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tariffs. &nbsp;China is fair game. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t respect intellectual property rights, human rights or fair trade. &nbsp;China is in the developed world category now&hellip;no need to support it with beneficial trade agreements. &nbsp;But, we need to be careful of broad-based tariffs. &nbsp;Yes, we can produce many things in the US, but not overnight. &nbsp;And we can never produce French Bordeaux &hellip; so why make people who like it pay more for it? &nbsp;The division of labor makes everyone more productive, and sometimes that crosses borders.</p> <p>13.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not, for any reason, get rid of the debt ceiling. &nbsp;Congress put it on hold until January 1, 2025 (after the 2024 elections), and the US has been running the most irresponsible government budgets in US history. &nbsp;Government must be made to justify its deficit spending, and voting on the debt ceiling makes it a public event. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a necessary check on out-of-control spending.</p> <p>This is just a partial list of the things that could be done. &nbsp;We could list hundreds of wasteful programs and burdensome rules that hold back productivity, investment, and growth in US standards of living.</p> <p>The government has grown massively. &nbsp;The Fed has grown massively. &nbsp;New technology in recent decades brought incredible potential, yet real GDP growth in the past 20 years has averaged just 2.1% per year. &nbsp;Many economists try to argue that new technologies aren&rsquo;t really productive, or that other flaws in the free markets system are why the economy is growing so slowly.</p> <p>If government spending actually improved the economy, things should be much better. &nbsp;But, they aren&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because big government is an impediment to growth. &nbsp;The bigger it gets, the slower we grow. &nbsp;Just look at Western Europe&hellip;stagnant for decades&hellip;underperforming stock markets&hellip;little entrepreneurship. &nbsp;If we really want to Make America Great Again, the US must Make American People Free From Government Burdens Again. &nbsp;This means &ldquo;going back&rdquo; to a time when government was much smaller. &nbsp;A smaller government means a bigger private sector, and more opportunity for individuals to create, serve and grow.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

Now that cuts have begun, the Fed no longer needs further confidence, but is focused instead on if the incoming data suggests any notable shifts on either inflation or employment as rate changes make their way through the system.</p> <p>Inevitably, questions in the press conference moved towards the election results, and how the Fed will respond to the increased likelihood of tax cuts and higher tariffs which could impact the path of inflation. In short, Powell stated that the election results have no impact on their short-term views. &nbsp;The Fed does not know what &ndash; or when &ndash; policy changes will be implemented under the new administration and has no plans to speculate. When policy changes arrive, the Fed will model for projected impacts, but they are just one piece in a dynamic economy. In the meantime, the Fed plans to move carefully and patiently.</p> <p>While the Fed continues to look at the same inflation metrics that caused it to first miss the rise in inflation following COVID, and then overestimate the pace at which inflation would come back to trend, we believe the money supply remains the single most important indicator on inflation&rsquo;s path forward. The M2 measure of money has been rising at a gradual pace after falling into contraction territory for much of 2022-23, and how M2 growth progresses from here will dictate if the Fed has room for further rate cuts or sees a re-acceleration of inflation as was seen when the Fed declared a premature victory on inflation back in the 1970&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p> <p>If M2 growth remains modest, both inflation and economic growth will slow, but the Fed will have room to continue cuts. If, however, rate cuts lead to a rapid rise in M2 growth, the Fed has shown an active neglect of the warning signs that would have preempted this inflation debacle to begin with. &nbsp;We will continue to watch &ndash; and report &ndash; on the money supply, and the ongoing ramifications it has on the economy as a whole.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

The good news for workers is that even though inflation is still elevated, &ldquo;real&rdquo; (inflation-adjusted) compensation per hour grew at a 3.0% annualized rate in Q3 and is up 2.8% in the past year. &nbsp;On the manufacturing front, productivity rose at a 1.0% annualized rate in Q3, as both output and hours fell, but hours fell at a faster pace. &nbsp;Even with government subsidies, manufacturing productivity is up 0.7% in the past year and fell 0.2% in the year prior. &nbsp;In other words, government direction of resources harms productivity in the longer term. &nbsp;On the labor front this morning, initial jobless claims rose 3,000 last week to 221,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims increased 39,000 to 1.892 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/7/nonfarm-productivity-increased-at-a-2.2percent-annual-rate-in-q3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:06:26 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/7/nonfarm-productivity-increased-at-a-2.2percent-annual-rate-in-q3 The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index Increased to 56.0 in October https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october <img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=0e1ace9a-c1af-4a0c-a0d9-a3a225cc6d87' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Activity in the US service sector accelerated in October as the ISM Services index increased to 56.0, the fastest pace in more than two years. &nbsp;The rise in activity was broad-based, with fourteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth and two reporting contraction. &nbsp;Looking at the details, the increase in the overall index can be attributed to higher readings for the employment index and the supplier deliveries index, which both rose by four or more percentage points. &nbsp;Comments from survey respondents reveal that hurricanes and port strikes boosted the supplier deliveries index, signaling longer lead times. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the employment index rose to the highest level in more than a year to 53.0, although growth was split, with just half (nine) of the major industries reporting an increase in employment and five reporting a decrease. &nbsp;The indexes for business activity and new orders both declined by two percentage points but sit firmly in expansion territory at 57.2 and 57.4, respectively, signaling growth. &nbsp;Finally, inflation remains a problem in the service sector. &nbsp;The prices paid index came in at the highest level for any category in the report at 58.1, with fifteen out of eighteen major industries paying higher prices. &nbsp;While monetary policy is tight (the M2 measure of the money supply is still down 2.3% from its peak in early 2022), it is less tight than it was before the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50bps at its last meeting. &nbsp;Though we expect the Federal Reserve to continue with a 25bps cut at the meeting this week &ndash; the embers of inflation still remain &ndash; and there are serious risks that an overly aggressive path of cuts could bring with them a pickup in the M2 measure of money, and with it a return of inflation.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p> Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:22:50 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october\n\nThis XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it.

If unchanged in November and December, these shipments would rise at a 0.5% annualized rate in Q4 versus the Q3 average. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not much, but it beats the declines in orders in both the second and third quarter this year, a clear sign that all is not well on the economic front. &nbsp;Meanwhile, overall orders for durable goods &ndash; both including and excluding transportation &ndash; are barely keeping pace with inflation. &nbsp;Change is on the horizon, with the Trump Administration heading back to Washington with a mandate to cut taxes, cut regulations, and trim the size of government. &nbsp;This will likely bring volatility to the data in the months ahead as business figure out how the new policy environment changes the outlook for investment and growth. &nbsp;In turn, the Federal Reserve will navigate what these changes mean for the path of inflation. &nbsp; The lagged effects of the Fed&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy are still working their way through the system, and the country hasn&rsquo;t fully weaned off the government&rsquo;s morphine-like stimulus response to COVID. &nbsp; Only time will tell how these opposing forces and ongoing geopolitical conflicts will play out in the year ahead. &nbsp;In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims fell 2,000 last week to 213,000.

At the same time, government benefit payments to individuals are up 7.8% and are accelerating in the past year, the largest 12-month increase (excluding the COVID stimulus period) in more than a decade. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t think the growth in government pay &ndash; or massive government deficit spending &ndash; is either sustainable or good for the US economy. &nbsp;On the spending side, consumption rose 0.4% in October, led by outlays on services which increased 0.5% on the month and are up 7.0% in the past year. &nbsp;Goods spending was unchanged in October and up a more modest 2.0% from a year ago. &nbsp;That said, a lot October spending growth came as a result of higher prices. &nbsp;PCE prices, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.2% in October, so when adjusting for inflation, consumption rose just 0.1% in October. &nbsp;PCE prices are up 2.3% in the past year, compared to a 3.0% increase in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;&ldquo;Core&rdquo; prices, which exclude the ever-volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.3% in October and are up 2.8% versus a year ago, an improvement from the 3.4% reading for the twelve months ending October 2023. &nbsp;But while year-ago comparisons have improved, it&rsquo;s important to note that the pace of inflation in October &ndash; both headline and core &ndash; still represents prices rising at a faster than 2.0% annualized rate. While the Fed believes they have room to continue cutting rates in the meetings ahead, the battle against inflation has not been won, and risks remain that an overly aggressive path of cuts could bring with them a pickup in the M2 measure of money, and with it a return of more inflation pressure. &nbsp;On the housing front, pending home sales, which are contracts on existing homes, rose 2.0% in October following a 7.5% surge in September. Plugging these figures into our model suggests existing home sales, which are counted at closing, will rise in November, although they&rsquo;ll remain low by historical standards.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/27/personal-income-rose-0.6percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:12:36 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/personal-income-rose-0.6percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Real GDP Growth in Q3 Was Unrevised at a 2.8% Annual Rate</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=cb00d654-908d-4293-8111-4e2ea5ba7eba' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Hold off on GDP for a moment. &nbsp;The most important data in this morning&rsquo;s report was on economy-wide corporate profits, which declined 0.3% in the third quarter vs. the second quarter, although still up 6.1% from a year ago. &nbsp;Profits from the rest of the world, which dropped 8.0%, led the decline in Q3 itself. Profits from domestic industries rose 0.8% from the previous quarter. &nbsp;Profit figures on the financial industry include the Federal Reserve and because the Fed pays private banks interest on reserves it has been generating unprecedented losses in recent quarters. &nbsp;Excluding the losses at the Fed (because we want to accurately count profits in the private sector), overall corporate profits were unchanged in the third quarter and up 4.8% from a year ago. &nbsp;Plugging in non-Fed profits into our Capitalized Profits Model suggests stocks remain overvalued. Looking at the other details of today&rsquo;s report, second quarter real GDP was unrevised at 2.8%. &nbsp;A small downward revision in spending on goods offset a small upward gain in business investment in research &amp; development. To focus on sustainable growth drivers, we follow \"core\" GDP, which includes consumer spending, business fixed investment, and home building, while excluding government purchases, inventories, and international trade, which are too volatile for long-term growth. &ldquo;Core&rdquo; GDP increased at a 3.2% annual rate in Q3. We also got a first look at the Q3 total for Real Gross Domestic Income, an alternative to GDP that is just as accurate. Real GDI rose at a 2.2% annual rate in Q3 and is up 3.1% versus a year ago. &nbsp;In other words, GDI suggests today&rsquo;s report on Q3 may overstate growth a little. &nbsp;On the inflation front, the GDP price index was revised slightly higher to a 1.9% annual rate in Q3 versus a prior estimate of 1.8% and up 2.2% from a year ago, hovering close to the Fed&rsquo;s target. &nbsp;In other news yesterday, the Federal Reserve released monthly figures on M2, showing it up 0.4% in October and up 3.1% in the past year. &nbsp;M2 surged during COVID, then declined from early 2022 through early 2023. &nbsp;It has stopped declining, but isn&rsquo;t rising rapidly, which should put continued downward pressure on the growth rate of inflation and nominal GDP in the year ahead.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:58:17 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/27/real-gdp-growth-in-q3-was-unrevised-at-a-2.8percent-annual-rate</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>New Single-Family Home Sales Declined 17.3% in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=b17c7af8-21d2-474c-b143-918ca3985c6d' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;New home sales posted the largest monthly decline since 2013 in October, coming in well below consensus expectations and hitting the slowest pace in two years. &nbsp;However, it looks like this was a result of one-off factors surrounding Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which temporarily delayed sales. The southern region, which is the largest in the US, was almost solely responsible for the decline in October and took the brunt of the extreme weather. Keep in mind that new home sales are a timelier barometer of the housing market because they are calculated when contracts are signed, while existing homes are only counted after the sale is closed, so we saw the impacts here first and will likely see a rebound in the months ahead. That said, the housing market continues to face other challenges. While thirty-year fixed mortgage rates were falling in the lead up to the initial Fed rate cut announcement in September, that has reversed with rates back above 7%. One piece of good news for potential buyers is that, even though prices are up in the past year, the median sales price of new homes is down 5% from the peak in 2022. It does look like a small part of this decline reflects a lower price per square foot as developers cut prices. &nbsp;The Census Bureau reports that from 2022 to 2023 (the most recent data available) the median price per square foot for single family homes sold fell 1.1%. While that decline is modest, it represents a stark reversal from the 45% gain from 2019 to 2022. &nbsp;That said, most of the drop in median prices is likely due to the mix of homes on the market including more lower priced options as developers complete smaller properties. Supply has also put more downward pressure on median prices for new homes than existing homes. &nbsp;The supply of completed single-family homes is up over 265% versus the bottom in 2022. This contrasts with the market for existing homes which continues to struggle with an inventory problem, often due to the difficulty of convincing current homeowners to give up the low fixed-rate mortgages they locked-in during the pandemic. &nbsp;While the future cost of financing remains a question, lower prices and an abundance of inventories are giving potential buyers a wider array of options will eventually help fuel a rebound in new home sales. In other housing news this morning, home prices rose in September, with the national Case-Shiller index up 0.3% and the FHFA index jumping 0.7%. &nbsp;In the last twelve months, these indices are up 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively. &nbsp;On the manufacturing front, the Richmond Fed index remained unchanged at -14 in November, highlighting ongoing weakness in that sector.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:10:07 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/26/new-single-family-home-sales-declined-17.3percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Three on Thursday - Is There Room to Cut?

While the headline gain of 3.4% is positive news, sales activity still remains near the slowest pace since the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis. One problem recently is that since Federal Reserve rate cuts began in September, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have risen back above 7%. So at least so far, the widely anticipated shot in the arm to the housing market from improved affordability hasn&rsquo;t happened and buyers continue to sit on the fence. Meanwhile, home prices are rising again with the median price of an existing home up 4.0% from a year ago. While most of the housing market remains stuck in low gear, certain segments have shown signs of life. Notably, sales of homes priced at $1 million and above have risen 23.0% in the past year versus just 2.9% for all existing home sales. This demonstrates that, at least at the higher end of the market, both buyers and sellers are beginning to adjust to the new reality of higher rates. However, outside the most expensive segment many existing homeowners remain reluctant to sell due to a &ldquo;mortgage lock-in&rdquo; phenomenon, after buying or refinancing at much lower rates before 2022. &nbsp;This remains a major impediment to activity by limiting future existing sales (and inventories). &nbsp;However, there are signs of progress with inventories rising 19.1% in the past year. &nbsp;That has helped push the months&rsquo; supply of homes (how long it would take to sell existing inventory at the current very slow sales pace) to 4.2 in September, a considerable improvement versus the past few years, but still below the benchmark of 5.0 that the National Association of Realtors uses to denote a normal market. &nbsp; A tight inventory of existing homes means that while the pace of sales looks like 2008, we aren&rsquo;t seeing that translate to a big decline in prices. &nbsp;In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims fell 6,000 last week to 213,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims rose 36,000 to 1.908 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year. Finally, on the manufacturing front, the Philadelphia Fed Index, a measure of factory sentiment in that region, fell to -5.5 in November from +10.3 in October.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/21/existing-home-sales-increased-3.4percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:05:29 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/21/existing-home-sales-increased-3.4percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Housing Starts Declined 3.1% in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=bc368593-1517-4614-86ac-970ef84bb1e8' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Homebuilding was weak in October, but not quite as bad as it looked. &nbsp;Overall housing starts missed consensus expectations and declined 3.1%, entirely due to a 6.9% drop in the single-family category. &nbsp;Looking at the details, construction in the South (the region with the largest share of homebuilding in the country) led the way downward with an 8.8% decline, as homebuilders in that region delayed activity in wake of hurricanes that swept through the area. &nbsp;Still, housing starts appear to be stuck in low-gear, down 4.0% from a year ago, and sit at roughly the same levels as 2019. &nbsp;The same cannot be said for completions. &nbsp;Despite a 4.4% drop for the month, completions were at a faster pace than any month in 2021-2023 and are up 16.8% in the past year. &nbsp;With strong completion activity and tepid growth in starts, the total number of homes under construction continues to fall, now down 12.7% since the start of 2024. &nbsp;That type of decline is usually associated with a housing bust or recession. &nbsp;The lack of new construction is why home prices have remained elevated while rents are still heading up in much of the country: we are building too few homes while lax enforcement of immigration laws mean rapid population growth. &nbsp;The home building sector seems strangely slow given our population growth and the ongoing need to scrap older homes due to disasters or for knockdowns. We think government rules and regulations are likely the major hurdle for builders in much of the country, but home construction might also be facing headwinds from a low unemployment rate (which makes it hard to find workers) as well as relatively high mortgage rates. &nbsp;Notably, while mortgage rates were trending lower leading up to the first rate cut announcement from the Federal Reserve in September, these rates are up more than 50bps since then. That said, there are some tailwinds for housing construction, as well. &nbsp;Many owners of existing homes are hesitant to sell and give up their fixed sub-3% mortgage rates, so prospective buyers will often need new builds. &nbsp;In addition, Millennials are now the largest living generation in the US and have begun to enter the housing market in force, which represents a demographic tailwind for activity. &nbsp;Putting it together, we don&rsquo;t see housing as a major driver of economic growth in the near term, but we&rsquo;re not expecting a housing bust like the 2000s on the way, either. &nbsp;In other recent housing news, the NAHB Housing Index (a measure of homebuilder sentiment) rose to 46 in November from 43 in October. &nbsp;However, a reading below 50 signals a greater number of builders view conditions as poor versus good.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:04:27 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/19/housing-starts-declined-3.1percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Don’t Forget the Lags</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/18/dont-forget-the-lags</link>\n\n<description><p>In our lifetimes, the best comparison for Trump&rsquo;s election win is Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s in 1980. &nbsp;That election, like this one, pitted big spenders and champions of government against tax cutters and critics of government.</p> <p>It is pretty clear that markets approved of both winning campaigns as they were happening. &nbsp;Leading up to the election in 1980, like this year, the S&amp;P 500 rallied as it became clearer that Reagan (like Trump) was likely to win. &nbsp;The market also rallied in the days following the election because markets like tax cuts, deregulation, and restrained government. &nbsp;And, at the same time, the policies the markets didn&rsquo;t like &ndash; such as a tax on unrealized capital gains &ndash; were now dead.</p> <p>But after being euphoric at the outcome of the election in 1980, reality set in. &nbsp;Paul Volcker was fighting inflation with tight money, a recession was inevitable and tax cuts took time to pass. &nbsp;The S&amp;P 500 fell in 1981 and in the first eight months of 1982 before the Reagan bull market really started.</p> <p>History doesn&rsquo;t repeat itself, but at times it rhymes. And while there are similarities between today and 1981, there are also some key differences. &nbsp;For example, the Federal Reserve is now cutting interest rates, not raising them. &nbsp;However, there are some big differences that investors need to pay attention to. &nbsp;First, in October 1980, the Price-Earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 was 8.6. &nbsp;In October 2024, the PE ratio was 27. &nbsp;In other words, while the market may appreciate better policies, it sure looks like they are already priced in.</p> <p>Moreover, while Trump is selecting his cabinet rapidly and his team has likely already done the homework needed to move fast on executive orders that can boost growth, much of the real work will take time. &nbsp;It appears Congress wants to move fast, but it is still Congress and that means it&rsquo;s messy.</p> <p>Reagan cut tax rates across the board, Trump plans to maintain most current tax rates with some small changes, and promised to eliminate taxes on tips, social security, and overtime. &nbsp;These tax cuts are welcome, but they are not true supply-side tax cuts&hellip;the ones that boost entrepreneurship and innovation.</p> <p>The really powerful potential of the Trump plans will come from DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, where Musk and Ramaswamy plan on proposing big cuts to the fourth branch of government &ndash; the Bureaucrats. &nbsp;Every regulation that they can cut, every bureaucrat that they can keep from gumming up the private sector, will boost productivity.</p> <p>But in addition to cutting red tape, the US must cut the absolute size of government. &nbsp;John Maynard Keynes wanted deficit spending ended after a crisis was over. &nbsp;But, after both the Panic of 2008 and COVID, the US kept spending elevated. &nbsp;Government spending has risen from 19.1% of GDP in 2007 to 23.4% this year. &nbsp;Government is a ball and chain on the economy. &nbsp;We estimate that every one percentage point increase of spending as a share of GDP reduces underlying real GDP growth by 0.2%.</p> <p>Every dollar the government spends is taken from the private sector, and the government taxes and borrows nearly 5% more of GDP today than it did seventeen years ago. &nbsp;From 1990 through 2007, real GDP grew 3% per year. &nbsp;From 2008 through the second quarter of 2024, real GDP has only grown 2% per year. &nbsp;No wonder &ldquo;the economy&rdquo; was the #1 factor for Americans in this election. &nbsp;Two percent annual growth is stagnation.</p> <p>And this shouldn&rsquo;t be happening according to fans of big government. &nbsp;Economists like Mark Zandi and Paul Krugman support government spending and argue that it has a positive multiplier ($1 of government spending creates more than $1 of GDP). &nbsp;Add this to the fact that the US has invented unbelievably productive new technologies in the last 17 years, and the economy should be booming. &nbsp;Especially with the Fed holding rates at zero for nine of those years.</p> <p>But it hasn&rsquo;t, and the reason is that government is just too darn big. &nbsp;Cutting government spending is a double-edged sword. &nbsp;Half of all job growth in the past year has been in government jobs directly, as well as healthcare which is dominated by government. &nbsp;Taking away that spending will initially slow job growth, but, with a lag, eventually boost economic activity.</p> <p>In other words, the Trump Administration has a chance to boost underlying economic growth rates, and that would be extremely positive for living standards and equity values over the long-term. &nbsp;But initially, it may result in slower growth. &nbsp;The US had a car wreck with COVID. &nbsp;Easy money from the Fed and big deficits were like morphine. &nbsp;The US is addicted to short-term fixes that do nothing to boost long-term growth. &nbsp;Withdrawal from the pain killers hurts, but is necessary to get truly healthy.</p> <p>While we are extremely positive about the long-term benefits of policy changes, like under Reagan, weaning the US from massively easy fiscal policies does not guarantee overnight success. &nbsp;It will take time, and the US will come through to the other side stronger. &nbsp;The entire world will benefit&hellip;with a lag.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

The Federal Reserve estimates that the Boeing strike held down total IP growth by 0.2 percentage points in October, and the lingering effects of two hurricanes subtracted an additional 0.1 points, as well. &nbsp;As a result, we should see some catch up growth going forward. Looking at the details in today&rsquo;s report, the weakness was concentrated in manufacturing, with activity falling 0.5%. &nbsp;Production in the volatile auto sector dropped 3.1% while non-auto manufacturing (which we think of as a &ldquo;core&rdquo; version of industrial production) posted a more modest decline of 0.3% in October. &nbsp;The only bright spot in this &ldquo;core&rdquo; measure came from production in high-tech equipment which rose 0.6% in October, likely the result of investment in AI as well as the reshoring of semiconductor production. &nbsp;High-tech manufacturing is up at a 10.0% annualized rate in the past three months and 7.6% in the past year, the fastest for any major category. &nbsp;The mining sector was also healthy in October, rising 0.3%. &nbsp;Higher production of oil and gas more than offset a decline in the drilling of new wells and the extraction of other minerals and metals. &nbsp;Finally, the utilities sector (which is volatile and largely dependent on weather) also posted an increase in October, rising 0.7%. &nbsp;In other manufacturing news this morning, the Empire State Index, which measures manufacturing sentiment in the New York region, surged unexpectedly to +31.2 in November from -11.9 in October.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/15/industrial-production-declined-0.3percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 20:18:35 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/industrial-production-declined-0.3percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Retail Sales Rose 0.4% in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=3221999b-929a-4e2b-8c3d-752604e2c674' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp; Despite years of higher prices, consumers continue to buy. &nbsp;Retail sales rose 0.4% in October versus a consensus expected increase of 0.3%, while prior months&rsquo; activity was revised higher, bringing the overall gain to 0.6%. &nbsp;Looking at the details, eight out of thirteen major sales categories rose in October. &nbsp;Overall activity was boosted by a 1.6% increase for autos. &nbsp;Stripping this out, sales were up a meager 0.1%. &nbsp;Taking out the two other often-volatile categories of gas stations and building materials, &ldquo;core&rdquo; sales (the most important group for measuring GDP) were unchanged for the month. &nbsp;Within the core sales grouping, restaurants and bars led the way, rising 0.7% following an upwardly revised 1.2% jump in the previous month. &nbsp;While healthy growth, the 4.3% increase in restaurant and bar sales in the last year represents a slowing from the 8.6% advance in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;We will be watching this category closely since it is the only glimpse we get at services in the retail sales report, which suffered heavily during the COVID years but have since returned to the forefront of the US consumer. &nbsp;Partially offsetting gains in October were declining sales for health &amp; personal care stores (-1.1%) and miscellaneous store retailers (-1.6%). &nbsp;As a whole, retail sales are up 2.8% on a year-to-year basis, barely keeping pace with inflation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Real&rdquo; inflation-adjusted retail sales are up 0.3% in the past year and still down from the peak in early 2022. &nbsp;This highlights the ugly ramifications of inflation: consumers are paying higher prices today but taking home fewer goods than they were two years ago. &nbsp;And while the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week and looks likely to cut again in December, it is not at all clear that inflation problems are behind us. &nbsp;Case in point, import prices rose 0.3% and export prices jumped 0.8% in October versus a consensus expected decline of 0.1% for both. &nbsp;We hope they have the resolve to stomp out the embers of inflation even if economic troubles come.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:19:26 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/retail-sales-rose-0.4percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Downsizing the Bureaucracy Won't Crash the Economy</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/15/downsizing-the-bureaucracy-wont-crash-the-economy</link>\n\n<description><p>The new Trump Administration hasn&rsquo;t wasted any time since last week&rsquo;s election win, with new information around economic policy and staffing appointments making news on a daily basis. In our opinion, the recent announcement of a new Department of Government Efficiency or &ldquo;DOGE&rdquo; headed by Elon Musk (who obviously came up with this name and acronym) and Vivek Ramaswamy, has been the most important so far.</p> <p>As we mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/11/mandate-for-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monday&rsquo;s piece</a>, both these individuals have been making the rounds on various podcasts, before and since Election Day, speaking about plans to not only cut unnecessary regulation, but also potentially move agencies out of D.C. and downsize the headcount of the Federal bureaucracy by up to 50%. For context that would be the biggest reduction in headcount since the aftermath of WW2 as the US demobilized from the war effort. &nbsp;Like everything in politics there are those who oppose these ideas. &nbsp;One argument in opposition is that mass layoffs in Washington put the US economy at risk for a recession. We think this worry is misplaced.</p> <p>The current Federal Government workforce (excluding the military) is roughly 3.0 million. Meanwhile, total employment in the US is around 160 million. We currently have 7 million unemployed individuals bringing the unemployment rate to 4.1%, a relatively low rate historically and one that hasn&rsquo;t caused the US economy to stop growing. If the &ldquo;DOGE&rdquo; were successful in firing 50% of Federal employees, total unemployment would rise to 8.5 million and the unemployment rate would increase to just 5.0%.</p> <p>If these job losses were all in the private sector, say in construction, it would lead to less production and a potential housing shortage. But, if these job losses are in bureaucracies that often interfere with production, then growth may actually accelerate. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get us wrong, we aren&rsquo;t against stop lights and speed limits, and we don&rsquo;t want to wait even longer to get our tax refund. But, a lot of government can be streamlined and automated. Moreover, these bureaucrats love to add pages to the Federal Register (a good proxy for total regulation). &nbsp;Today, total pages of regulation have rebounded to near a record high.</p> <p>Further, the vast majority of these workers will find work in the private sector, where free markets more efficiently allocate resources. These are well educated individuals with lots of potentially valuable skills that aren&rsquo;t being fully utilized. The unemployment rate for people with a college degree or higher in the US is currently just 2.5%. These former bureaucrats would be able to find new jobs relatively quickly and this reallocation of talent would be an asset to future growth and innovation. And throughout the process, generous severances packages would give workers ample coverage while they find new work.</p> <p>The reality is that the government has gotten too darn big. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulation costs the US economy roughly $2 trillion a year. Add in Federal, State and Local spending and over 50% of the US economy is at the whim of the bureaucracy. This puts a wet blanket on innovation, with companies spending countless hours, dollars, and intellectual manpower trying to comply with rules and regulations, rather than applying those resources toward new and innovative ways to improve consumers&rsquo; quality of life. One clear example of this economic distortion, the Wall Street Journal recently reported 40% of the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalization is being investigated by the Department of Justice, while the Department of Wildlife is interfering with the launch of rockets. &nbsp;The real question is if we can afford not to address this growing problem, and we find it very encouraging that leadership is finally taking the issue seriously.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

One of his newly appointed advisors, Elon Musk, has proposed the ambitious goal of cutting at least $2 trillion from the federal budget, aiming to bring greater efficiency to government operations. While Musk&rsquo;s track record of innovation and cost cutting suggests he might be up to the challenge, reducing nearly a third of federal spending will neither be easy or universally popular. In this edition of &ldquo;Three on Thursday&rdquo;, we take a broad look at federal spending.&nbsp;</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/14/three-on-thursday----is-there-room-to-cut-examining-federal-spending-pt-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to view the report</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:53:18 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/three-on-thursday---is-there-room-to-cut-examining-federal-spending-part-1</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>The Producer Price Index (PPI) Rose 0.2% in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=8073fe05-96a9-423a-9006-9d59e3438e12' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;While the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week and looks likely to cut again in December, it is not at all clear that inflation problems are behind us. &nbsp;Producer prices rose 0.2% in October, despite declines in food and energy prices, which fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. &nbsp;These categories have played an outsized role in the slower inflation readings of recent months, but when you strip out these historically volatile components, &ldquo;core&rdquo; producer prices rose 0.3% in October and are up 3.1% in the past year, an acceleration from the 2.2% reading for the twelve months ending October 2023. &nbsp;Diving into the details of today&rsquo;s report shows service prices led the core index higher, rising 0.3% in October and up 3.5% in the past year. &nbsp;The October increase in services was broad based, with all major categories showing higher prices. &nbsp;Prices for goods rose 0.1% in October and are up a modest 0.2% from a year ago. &nbsp;Within goods, rising costs for steel scrap, meats, and diesel fuel more than offset an 18.1% decline in liquified petroleum gas prices. &nbsp;Further back in the supply chain, prices in October rose 0.5% for intermediate demand processed goods and 4.1% for unprocessed goods, but prices in both categories are down in the past year. &nbsp;The direction of inflation moving forward is very likely to be dictated by 1) the services side of the economy, which suffered heavily during the COVID shutdowns but has since returned to the forefront and 2) changes in the money supply, which, after surging in 2020-21, peaked in early 2022. Although the M2 measure of money has been rising gradually since last October, it&rsquo;s still down 2.3% from the peak in April 2022. &nbsp;Too little growth in the money supply means continued downward pressure on both inflation and economic growth. &nbsp;We will be watching the path of M2 growth closely as the Fed continues cutting rates. A sharp resurgence in M2 growth would bring with it the risk of accelerating inflation. Does the Fed have the patience to ease at a slow and steady pace, or will they overreact to any signs of economic trouble? Only time will tell, but the stakes are high, and the Fed&rsquo;s record is less than pristine. &nbsp;On the labor front this morning, initial jobless claims fell 4,000 last week to 217,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims declined 11,000 to 1.873 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:00:25 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/14/the-producer-price-index-ppi-rose-0.2percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rose 0.2% in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=79d3e762-11bc-4bd7-a3e6-6fe56dcb0a8a' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp; Inflation came in as expected in October but remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2.0% mandate, warning investors that the inflation story is not over. &nbsp;Headline prices rose 0.2% in October (+3.0% annualized) while the twelve-month reading rose for the first time in six months to 2.6%. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth noting that lately inflation has been held down by declining energy prices, which were unchanged in October but are down 4.9% in the last year. &nbsp;Excluding energy, prices are up 3.2% in the last year. Stripping out the often-volatile category as well as food prices (+0.2% in October) to get &ldquo;core&rdquo; prices shows that measure rose 0.3% in October (+3.4% annualized), while the year-ago comparison remained at 3.3%. &nbsp;The main driver of core inflation has been housing rents, which rose 0.4% and have shown little to no sign of slowing. &nbsp;Some analysts &ndash; including those at the Fed &ndash; have argued that housing rents have artificially boosted the inflation picture due to the way it&rsquo;s measured and the lags at which those changes are reflected in the monthly reports. &nbsp;But a subset category of prices the Fed used to tell investors to watch closely but no longer seems to mention &ndash; known as the &ldquo;Supercore&rdquo; &ndash; which excludes food, energy, other goods, and housing rents, rose 0.3% in October and are up 4.4% in the last year, worse than the 3.7% reading in the year ending in October 2023. &nbsp;No matter which way you cut it, inflation is still running above the Fed&rsquo;s 2.0% target, now for the 44th consecutive month. &nbsp;We have said for some time that easing in inflation will come should the Fed have the resolve to let the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy do its work. &nbsp;But the Fed has now cut rates a total of 75bps since September. &nbsp;And yet the embers of inflation continue burning. &nbsp;Since we have yet to see a significant or prolonged slowdown in growth, much less a recession, it remains to be seen whether inflation will reach 2.0% or less on a consistent basis. &nbsp;This month&rsquo;s report did no favors proving that.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:04:28 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/13/the-consumer-price-index-cpi-rose-0.2percent-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>The Fed’s Challenge</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/11/the-feds-challenge</link>\n\n<description><p>The Federal Reserve cut short-term rates by a quarter percentage point last week, like pretty much everyone expected. &nbsp;In addition, the Fed didn&rsquo;t push back hard against market expectations of another quarter-point cut in mid-December, so unless the economic or financial news changes dramatically by then, expect a repeat at the next meeting.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why the Fed has been cutting rates. &nbsp;The consumer price index is up 2.4% in the past year versus a 3.7% gain in the year-ending in September 2023. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the PCE deflator, which the Fed uses for its official 2.0% inflation target, is only up 2.1% in the past year while it was up 3.4% in the year ending in September 2023.</p> <p>However, in spite of getting into the Red Zone versus inflation, the Fed isn&rsquo;t yet in the End Zone, and it looks like progress has recently stalled. &nbsp;According to the Atlanta Fed, the CPI is projected to be up 2.7% in the year ending this November while PCE prices should be up 2.5%.</p> <p>It's also important to recognize that a few years ago the Fed itself devised a measure it called Supercore inflation, which excludes food, energy, all other goods, and housing. &nbsp;That measure of prices is still up 4.3% versus a year ago, which is probably why the Fed has stopped talking about it.</p> <p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that there&rsquo;s a huge gulf between the policy implications of the Fed reaching its 2.0% inflation goal and the public&rsquo;s perception of inflation no longer being a problem. &nbsp;Right or wrong, for now, the public seems to think that for inflation to no longer be a problem prices would have to go back down to where they were pre-COVID.</p> <p>But that&rsquo;s not going to happen. &nbsp;The federal government spent like drunken sailors during COVID and the Fed helped accommodate that spending by allowing the M2 measure of the money supply to soar. &nbsp;M2 is off the peak it hit in early 2022, but it would take a much greater reduction than so far experienced to restore prices as they were almost five years ago.</p> <p>Instead, getting to 2.0% inflation means eventually accepting not only that prices aren&rsquo;t going back to where they were but they&rsquo;re going to keep rising, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p>And remember, even that goal has so far remained elusive. &nbsp;The embers of inflation continue burning. &nbsp;And since we have yet to see a significant or prolonged slowdown in growth, much less a recession, it remains to be seen whether inflation will reach 2.0% or less on a consistent basis.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the Fed&rsquo;s inflation goal remains elusive. &nbsp;In turn, that means don&rsquo;t be surprised if the Fed pauses rate cuts early next year.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to find a nook or cranny of human activity not impacted by government money, taxes and regulations.</p> <p>In the first 219 years of its history the federal government grew from nothing to a budget of $3 trillion. &nbsp;In the 16 years since then, because of the Financial Panic of 2008 and COVID, government spending more than doubled to $6.75 trillion. &nbsp;These were emergencies (and we disagreed with all that spending), but after an emergency you&rsquo;d expect spending to return to pre-emergency levels. &nbsp;But history shows politicians never let a crisis go to waste, and their power and spending just rachets higher. &nbsp;Instead of going toward new innovations, those resources have been building bigger bureaucracies and have pushed hundreds of billions into Green New Deal initiatives.</p> <p>The insanity of spending this much to force the economy in a direction picked by politicians isn&rsquo;t lost on businesses. &nbsp;When Google, Microsoft, and Meta need electricity for their new AI factories, where do they go? &nbsp;Nuclear power, which the government has ignored. &nbsp;Government doesn&rsquo;t treat taxpayer resources well. &nbsp;It never has and it never will. &nbsp;Only when it is their own money do people care how it is spent.</p> <p>And all this spending has created an insatiable desire to tax at the federal, state and local levels. &nbsp;Combine taxes with inflation and no wonder savings rates are so low and 70% of those polled say the economy is not working for them. &nbsp;Hearing President Trump support tax cuts for tips, social security and overtime is music to hard-working-American&rsquo;s ears.</p> <p>Given all this, and the fact that there is a mandate for action, many are wondering what is likely to happen. &nbsp;First, it is clear that if the Trump team goes in with a milquetoast agenda, tweaking spending here, tax rates there, and gets involved with political horse trading, the victory will be wasted. &nbsp;The Trump team needs to take a page from the Javier Milei playbook. &nbsp;Go fast and go big. &nbsp;But it needs to be done with the understanding that some things will pay off quickly and others will take time.</p> <p>The stock market has soared since the election results were finalized, suggesting that investors believe a Trump presidency is good for the economy. &nbsp;However, it could also be that the market is reacting to the fact that the worst policies of a Harris presidency, like taxes on unrealized gains, or interfering with large tech companies and maybe Elon Musk directly, won&rsquo;t happen. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably a little bit of both, and if Trump follows the right policies, he can help the market build on these gains.</p> <p>Below is a list of things we would suggest the Trump team focus on and attempt to legislate. &nbsp;None of this is easy&hellip;but, from our point of view all of it would be positive for America.</p> <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve never met a tax cut we didn&rsquo;t like. &nbsp;The Trump tax cuts from 2017 should be extended permanently and cutting taxes on tips, social security, and overtime all sound like great ideas to us.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close DEI offices in every government agency and office, most importantly the military. &nbsp;Follow the lead of Boeing, the University of North Carolina, the University of Florida, Tractor Supply, and many others who found that DEI goals undermine their institutions. &nbsp;Go woke and go broke. &nbsp;Believe in meritocracy and win. &nbsp;The biggest problem is that failures by government bureaucracies aren&rsquo;t as visible as they are in companies that compete in a market. &nbsp;There is no profit and loss statement for government. &nbsp;But getting rid of DEI will immediately improve these agencies. &nbsp;The military may finally hit its recruitment goals.</p> <p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Put universities and colleges on the hook for 50% of every student loan. &nbsp;If a student can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t repay after getting a degree from an institution of higher learning, it needs to be responsible for at least half of it. &nbsp;Just watch how quickly schools start pushing students toward degrees that are actually valuable in the real world. &nbsp;Student loans pay activist professors to train more activists. &nbsp;What a massive waste of resources it is to train people to play politics.</p> <p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Build a wall. &nbsp;Close the border. &nbsp;Deport criminals. &nbsp;But, also, create a system for making legal immigration easier. &nbsp;Make certain that new immigrants get a job and are not allowed to sign up for welfare, or any government handouts, for five years. &nbsp;In America&rsquo;s great immigration of the late 1800s and early 1900s, we put our arms around people and said, &ldquo;welcome to America, good luck.&rdquo; &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;welcome to America, here&rsquo;s a check.&rdquo;</p> <p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deregulate, deregulate, deregulate. &nbsp;Cut, cut, cut. &nbsp;Evidently Elon Musk may be named the head of DOGE. &nbsp;Department of Government Efficiency. &nbsp;Musk fired 80% of the staff at Twitter when he bought it, and it operates better than ever. &nbsp;Why? Because those people he fired were there to use Twitter as a political weapon, not to build the best news platform in the world. &nbsp;It is highly likely that years of lousy productivity growth in government has created a situation where at least 50% of the three million government employees are unnecessary. &nbsp;Musk shared an idea with Joe Rogan on his podcast that maybe we just send people home and, yet, still pay them. &nbsp;Total government payroll is likely around $300 billion per year. &nbsp;Spending $150 billion (half the payroll) to pay 50% of all bureaucrats to not come to work, and not cause problems for Americans who are just trying to get ahead, would likely increase productivity by way more than $150 billion per year. &nbsp;So, if it becomes hard to slim down bureaucracies because of union work rules, don&rsquo;t fire them, just have them turn in their credentials, computer, and phone. &nbsp;Send them home.</p> <p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asset managers should no longer be able to vote shares in the companies that their clients actually own. &nbsp;Centralized power, in the hands of asset managers, should not be able to be used to bully other companies into behaving in a way that only a few people think is appropriate. &nbsp;Give voting power back to the actual owners of the shares. &nbsp;Decentralize and put the days of ESG behind us.</p> <p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drill, baby, drill.</p> <p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cut spending. &nbsp;Start with Green New Deal subsidies. &nbsp;When companies like Google, Microsoft and Meta choose nuclear, it&rsquo;s a sign. &nbsp;Let all these clean industries compete in a fair and balanced marketplace and see who the winner is. &nbsp;If solar and wind are so fantastic&hellip;prove it by taking away the subsidies. &nbsp;Stop subsidizing primary education from Washington DC. &nbsp;Primary education is a local issue, and funding from DC is used to prop up teachers&rsquo; unions which fought to keep schools closed during COVID and constantly impede attempts to get vouchers. &nbsp;These fund transfers from the federal government to state governments are propping up bankrupt cities and states. &nbsp;These states need to face reality, and not be bailed out.</p> <p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Financial Panic of 2008 and COVID pushed federal spending from 19% of GDP to nearly 24% of GDP. &nbsp;The US has never balanced its federal budget with spending over 18.5% of GDP no matter what tax rates are put in place. &nbsp;Even John Maynard Keynes &ndash; father of deficit spending &ndash; would argue that once the crisis is over, deficit spending needs to stop. &nbsp;The US should make every attempt it can to take spending back to 2007 levels. &nbsp;Not in actual dollar terms (we have experienced a lot of inflation), but in percentage of GDP terms. &nbsp;So, how is that done? One way is what we referred to in Point 8 above, but spending cuts are easily demagogued and are often unpopular&hellip;so let&rsquo;s propose a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; on spending at 2024 overall levels. &nbsp;If the US froze spending for seven years, the budget would be balanced. &nbsp;In other words, the US could put in place a process by which we could actually see surpluses in 2031&hellip;which will be necessary because that is just about the time Social Security starts running red ink.</p> <p>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Federal Reserve has a classic bureaucratic mission creep problem going on. &nbsp;For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has a Community Development Department that highlights &ldquo;childcare&rdquo; and &ldquo;lead water pipes&rdquo; on its website. &nbsp;Economics encompasses every part of life, so the Fed argues all of this is within its purview. &nbsp;It also believes it should be involved in fighting &ldquo;climate change,&rdquo; by saying weather issues could turn into financial, economic, and banking issues. &nbsp;But the Fed has only one job and that is maintaining the sanctity and value of the US dollar, and 40-year highs in inflation are proof that it has failed. &nbsp;The Fed needs to stop the activism. &nbsp;Moreover, the Federal Reserve, because of its move to abundant reserves, is losing about $100 billion dollars per year. &nbsp;So, how does it pay its employees? &nbsp;It appears that it is borrowing money from the Treasury. And to do this it uses an absurd accounting gimmick called a &ldquo;deferred asset&rdquo; &ndash; basically a promise to make profits in the future. &nbsp;We do not believe Congress approved this use of taxpayer funds to pay for Fed employees (especially ones that are behaving more like activists than monetary policy experts). &nbsp;There is a potential court case here using the Loper decision (repeal of Chevron) as its basis. &nbsp;The Treasury should not be paying for Fed losses. &nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the same issue has occurred with the Bank of England, but the UK counts this loss and the resulting spending as part of its deficit. &nbsp;That is the right way to do it, but accounting gimmicks in the US hide this from the public, and Congress.</p> <p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without going into all the details, the Trump Administration should push the Fed to return to a &ldquo;scarce reserve&rdquo; model. &nbsp;The Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet has grown from roughly $800 billion in 2007 to over $7 trillion today, 90% added in just 17 years. &nbsp;Government entities across the board used 2008 and COVID to expand their power, reach, and control in alarming ways. &nbsp;This all needs to be pushed back. &nbsp;Government should never be this big and powerful. &nbsp;The 2008 panic started with about $400 billion in losses on subprime loans. &nbsp;Today, banks have over half a trillion in losses on their books because of the way the Fed responded to those crises. &nbsp;In other words, the Fed has made the system less secure and stable, not more. &nbsp;End Quantitative Easing and roll back the Fed.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tariffs. &nbsp;China is fair game. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t respect intellectual property rights, human rights or fair trade. &nbsp;China is in the developed world category now&hellip;no need to support it with beneficial trade agreements. &nbsp;But, we need to be careful of broad-based tariffs. &nbsp;Yes, we can produce many things in the US, but not overnight. &nbsp;And we can never produce French Bordeaux &hellip; so why make people who like it pay more for it? &nbsp;The division of labor makes everyone more productive, and sometimes that crosses borders.</p> <p>13.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not, for any reason, get rid of the debt ceiling. &nbsp;Congress put it on hold until January 1, 2025 (after the 2024 elections), and the US has been running the most irresponsible government budgets in US history. &nbsp;Government must be made to justify its deficit spending, and voting on the debt ceiling makes it a public event. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a necessary check on out-of-control spending.</p> <p>This is just a partial list of the things that could be done. &nbsp;We could list hundreds of wasteful programs and burdensome rules that hold back productivity, investment, and growth in US standards of living.</p> <p>The government has grown massively. &nbsp;The Fed has grown massively. &nbsp;New technology in recent decades brought incredible potential, yet real GDP growth in the past 20 years has averaged just 2.1% per year. &nbsp;Many economists try to argue that new technologies aren&rsquo;t really productive, or that other flaws in the free markets system are why the economy is growing so slowly.</p> <p>If government spending actually improved the economy, things should be much better. &nbsp;But, they aren&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because big government is an impediment to growth. &nbsp;The bigger it gets, the slower we grow. &nbsp;Just look at Western Europe&hellip;stagnant for decades&hellip;underperforming stock markets&hellip;little entrepreneurship. &nbsp;If we really want to Make America Great Again, the US must Make American People Free From Government Burdens Again. &nbsp;This means &ldquo;going back&rdquo; to a time when government was much smaller. &nbsp;A smaller government means a bigger private sector, and more opportunity for individuals to create, serve and grow.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

Now that cuts have begun, the Fed no longer needs further confidence, but is focused instead on if the incoming data suggests any notable shifts on either inflation or employment as rate changes make their way through the system.</p> <p>Inevitably, questions in the press conference moved towards the election results, and how the Fed will respond to the increased likelihood of tax cuts and higher tariffs which could impact the path of inflation. In short, Powell stated that the election results have no impact on their short-term views. &nbsp;The Fed does not know what &ndash; or when &ndash; policy changes will be implemented under the new administration and has no plans to speculate. When policy changes arrive, the Fed will model for projected impacts, but they are just one piece in a dynamic economy. In the meantime, the Fed plans to move carefully and patiently.</p> <p>While the Fed continues to look at the same inflation metrics that caused it to first miss the rise in inflation following COVID, and then overestimate the pace at which inflation would come back to trend, we believe the money supply remains the single most important indicator on inflation&rsquo;s path forward. The M2 measure of money has been rising at a gradual pace after falling into contraction territory for much of 2022-23, and how M2 growth progresses from here will dictate if the Fed has room for further rate cuts or sees a re-acceleration of inflation as was seen when the Fed declared a premature victory on inflation back in the 1970&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p> <p>If M2 growth remains modest, both inflation and economic growth will slow, but the Fed will have room to continue cuts. If, however, rate cuts lead to a rapid rise in M2 growth, the Fed has shown an active neglect of the warning signs that would have preempted this inflation debacle to begin with. &nbsp;We will continue to watch &ndash; and report &ndash; on the money supply, and the ongoing ramifications it has on the economy as a whole.</p> <p><strong>Brian S.

The good news for workers is that even though inflation is still elevated, &ldquo;real&rdquo; (inflation-adjusted) compensation per hour grew at a 3.0% annualized rate in Q3 and is up 2.8% in the past year. &nbsp;On the manufacturing front, productivity rose at a 1.0% annualized rate in Q3, as both output and hours fell, but hours fell at a faster pace. &nbsp;Even with government subsidies, manufacturing productivity is up 0.7% in the past year and fell 0.2% in the year prior. &nbsp;In other words, government direction of resources harms productivity in the longer term. &nbsp;On the labor front this morning, initial jobless claims rose 3,000 last week to 221,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims increased 39,000 to 1.892 million. &nbsp;These figures are consistent with continued job growth in November, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/7/nonfarm-productivity-increased-at-a-2.2percent-annual-rate-in-q3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:06:26 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/7/nonfarm-productivity-increased-at-a-2.2percent-annual-rate-in-q3</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index Increased to 56.0 in October</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=0e1ace9a-c1af-4a0c-a0d9-a3a225cc6d87' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p><strong>Implications: </strong>&nbsp;Activity in the US service sector accelerated in October as the ISM Services index increased to 56.0, the fastest pace in more than two years. &nbsp;The rise in activity was broad-based, with fourteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth and two reporting contraction. &nbsp;Looking at the details, the increase in the overall index can be attributed to higher readings for the employment index and the supplier deliveries index, which both rose by four or more percentage points. &nbsp;Comments from survey respondents reveal that hurricanes and port strikes boosted the supplier deliveries index, signaling longer lead times. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the employment index rose to the highest level in more than a year to 53.0, although growth was split, with just half (nine) of the major industries reporting an increase in employment and five reporting a decrease. &nbsp;The indexes for business activity and new orders both declined by two percentage points but sit firmly in expansion territory at 57.2 and 57.4, respectively, signaling growth. &nbsp;Finally, inflation remains a problem in the service sector. &nbsp;The prices paid index came in at the highest level for any category in the report at 58.1, with fifteen out of eighteen major industries paying higher prices. &nbsp;While monetary policy is tight (the M2 measure of the money supply is still down 2.3% from its peak in early 2022), it is less tight than it was before the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50bps at its last meeting. &nbsp;Though we expect the Federal Reserve to continue with a 25bps cut at the meeting this week &ndash; the embers of inflation still remain &ndash; and there are serious risks that an overly aggressive path of cuts could bring with them a pickup in the M2 measure of money, and with it a return of inflation.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/EconomicResearch/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> for a PDF version</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:22:50 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/EconBlog/2024/11/5/the-ism-non-manufacturing-index-increased-to-56.0-in-october</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n...\n\n</channel>\n\n...\n\n</rss>\n"

While quarterly earnings estimates provide a view into the expected financial performance of a given company, they are not guarantees, and equity analysts continually adjust their estimates as new information is obtained. That said, from Q3&rsquo;20 through Q3'24 (the 17 quarters in today&rsquo;s chart), the average earnings beat rate for the companies that comprise the Index was 77.6%.</p> <p><strong>As of 11/20/24, the sectors with the highest Q3&rsquo;24 earnings beat rates and their percentages were as follows: Information Technology (87.5%); Health Care (83.3%); Financials (77.5%); and Consumer Staples (77.4%), according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Real Estate had the lowest beat rate at 45.2%, while Materials had the highest earnings miss rate (46.4%) over the quarter.</strong></p> <p><strong>As indicated in today&rsquo;s chart, the percentage of companies in the Index that reported higher than expected earnings in Q3&rsquo;24 (71.7%) stood 5.9 percentage points below the 4-year average of 77.6%.</strong></p> <p>Per the chart, this is not unusual. The Index&rsquo;s earnings beat rate exceeded the average in just seven of the 17 quarters presented. More recently, the Index&rsquo;s beat rate exceeded the average in just two of the past eight consecutive quarters. Keep in mind that the Q3&rsquo;24 data in the chart reflects earnings results for 470 of the 503 companies that comprise the Index and could change in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>FactSet reported that the blended, year-over-year (y-o-y) earnings growth rate for the Index stood at 5.8% as of 11/22/24.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>If the metric remains positive, it will mark the fifth consecutive quarter of y-o-y earnings growth. For comparison, the y-o-y earnings growth rates for Q1&rsquo;24 and Q2&rsquo;24 were 5.8% and 11.2%, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: While earnings beats are generally viewed as positive for the overall market, they represent just one piece of an intricate puzzle. As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, the earnings beat rate for the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index has been below the average in most of the time frames presented (including the most recent quarter). Despite this fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 5,969.34 on 11/22/24, representing an increase of 66.9% on a price only basis from its most recent low of 3,577.03 (10/12/22). From our perspective, persistent earnings growth has been a key catalyst to higher equity valuations. Case-in-point, the Q3&rsquo;24 blended (y-o-y) earnings growth rate for the Index was 5.8% on 11/22/24. While that is below the 5-year and 10-year averages of 10.0% and 8.5%, respectively, it represents the fifth consecutive quarter of y-o-y earnings growth for the Index. Additionally, earnings are estimated to rise substantially over the coming quarters. FactSet reported that analysts estimate the Index&rsquo;s earnings will increase by 12.0%, 12.7%, 12.1%, and 15.3% in Q4&rsquo;24, Q1&rsquo;25, Q2&rsquo;25 and Q3&rsquo;25, respectively.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The practice is so common that 403 of the 503 constituents in the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;the Index&rdquo;) distributed a cash dividend to their equity owners as of 11/14/24. In addition to acting as a conduit for the return of capital, dividend distributions account for a significant portion of the Index&rsquo;s total return. According to data from Bloomberg, dividends contributed to over 37% of the total return of the Index over the 96-year period between December 30, 1927, and December 29, 2023.</p> <ul> <li>Dividend payments from S&amp;P500 Index constituents totaled $70.91 per share (record high) in 2023, up from $67.57 (previous record high) in 2022.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>As of 11/18/24, dividend payments are estimated to total $77.24 and $81.68 per share in 2024 and 2025, up from $74.54 and $79.66 per share in 2024 and 2025, respectively, on 1/31/24.</li> <li>Of the 11 major sectors that comprise the Index, eight of them had yields above the 1.26% generated by the Index over the period captured in the table. Financials, Information Technology, and Health Care contributed the most to the Index's dividend payout at 15.63%, 15.45% and 14.10%, respectively.<br><br></li> <li>The payout ratio for the S&amp;P 500 Index stood at 36.43% on 11/18/24. A dividend payout ratio between 30% and 60% is typically a good sign that a dividend distribution is sustainable, according to Nasdaq.<br><br></li> <li>Many investors view changes in dividend distributions as an indication of strength and or weakness in the underlying company. For that reason, companies will often avoid decreasing or suspending their dividend payout. There were a total of 12 dividend cuts and two suspensions year-to-date through the end of October. For comparison, 22 dividends were cut and four were suspended over the same period last year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Dividend distributions continue to be one of the most efficient methods by which companies can return capital to their shareholders. As such, investors often view consistent dividend payments and dividend increases as indications of strength. In the 96-year period between December 30, 1927, and December 29, 2023, more than 37% of the total return of the Index came from dividends. Remarkably, dividend growth estimates for the Index have increased since the start of the year. The Index&rsquo;s 2024 dividend payments were forecast to total a record $77.24 per share on 11/18/24, up from $74.54 per share on 1/31/24. Furthermore, dividend sustainability appears to have improved since 2023.

As evidenced by recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, as well as the vast market for smartphones, tablets, and wearables, we continue to find creative and innovative ways to integrate semiconductors into our everyday lives.</p> <p><strong>Semiconductor sales appear to lag fluctuations in the valuations of technology stocks.</strong></p> <p>As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, changes in semiconductor sales typically occur after changes in the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index. This phenomenon continues to be true as of today&rsquo;s update to this post. Case in point, the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index increased to its third consecutive quarterly all time high at the end of September 2024. By contrast, prior to the most recent quarter, semiconductor sales hadn&rsquo;t posted a quarterly record since Q4&rsquo;21.</p> <p><strong>Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled a record $166.0 billion in Q3&rsquo;24, an increase of 23.2% from Q3&rsquo;23.</strong></p> <p>Amidst unprecedented demand, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that worldwide semiconductor sales surged by 26.2% to a record $555.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, sales increased to another record &nbsp;($574.1 billion), but had begun to stagnate in the second half of the year. In 2023, worldwide sales of semiconductors declined by 8.2% year-over-year to $526.8 billion. Since then, as evidenced by the third quarter&rsquo;s record, sales of semiconductors increased dramatically. Aggregate semiconductor sales totaled $456.7 billion year-to-date through 9/30/24, putting them within reach of 2022&rsquo;s record tally.</p> <p><strong>The technology sector continues to be a top performing sector compared to its peers.</strong></p> <p>Propelled forward by promising developments in AI and an easing in the global chip shortage, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index increased by 57.84% in 2023. In our view, these factors remain relevant today, and continue to entice investors to the sector. Year-to-date through 11/12/24, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index posted a total return of 36.34%, second only to the S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index which increased by 37.41% on a total return basis over the same time frame. Despite surging valuations, recent cuts to the federal funds rate appear to have made competing sectors more attractive to investors. Tellingly, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index increased by just 1.58% since 7/9/24, the day Jerome Powell testified that the U.S. economy was no longer overheated, making it the worst performing of all 11 subsectors that comprise the broader S&amp;P 500 Index over the period (7/9 thru 11/12).</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: It is nearly impossible to discuss semiconductors and technology stocks without mentioning developments in AI, and rightly so. One forecast suggests the global AI market could grow to nearly $600 billion by 2026 and $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Ryan Issakainen, ETF Strategist at First Trust Portfolios L.P. These estimates, coupled with resilient U.S. consumer spending, and increasing demand for semiconductors have served as potent catalysts to technology stocks over the past several years. Despite record technology sector valuations, global semiconductor sales remain below their all-time yearly high set in 2022. That said, increased demand for AI-related chips resulted in record semiconductor sales in Q3&rsquo;24. Should that trend continue, 2024 could be a record setting year for sales in the space.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

On November 11, 2024, the Index closed at a record 6,001.35, representing an increase of 25.82% on a price-only basis from when it closed at 4,769.83 on December 29, 2023, according to data from Bloomberg. For comparison, from 1928-2023 (96 years) the Index posted an average annual total return of 9.56%. In our post on this topic from October 2023 (<a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2023/10/5/sp-500-index-earnings--revenue-growth-rate-estimates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a>), we wrote that increased revenues could boost earnings and provide the catalyst for higher equity valuations going forward. We believe that the Index&rsquo;s year-to-date price improvement is reflective, in part, of that scenario playing out.</p> <p>The most recent estimates reveal favorable earnings growth expectations.</p> <p>As today&rsquo;s table shows, earnings for the companies that comprise the Index are estimated to increase by a combined 9.7% and 12.8%, respectively, year-over-year (y-o-y) in 2024 and 2025. These figures are mixed from when they stood at 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively, the last time we posted on this topic (<strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/9/12/sp-500-index-earnings--revenue-growth-rate-estimates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></strong>). Keep in mind that estimates for 2024 reflect favorable comparisons to 2023&rsquo;s earnings which declined by 0.9% in 2023 (not in table). In 2024, earnings are now estimated to decline in three of the eleven sectors that comprise the Index (Energy, Industrials, and Materials), up from just two in our last post. The Energy sector&rsquo;s 2024 earnings estimates continued to decline, falling from -12.6% in our last post to -19.0%. From our perspective, the decline in earnings estimates is likely reflective of plummeting oil and gas prices. The price of WTI crude oil stood at $68.04 per barrel on November 11, 2024, down 11.83% y-o-y, according to data from Bloomberg. The price of natural gas stood at $2.92 per million BTUs as of the same date, down 3.73% y-o-y.</p> <p><strong>Revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 and 2025 remain favorable.</strong></p> <p>As of November 8, the estimated revenue growth rate for companies in the Index stood at 5.2% and 5.5%, respectively in 2024 and 2025. These figures are mixed since our last post when they stood at 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025. Nine of the eleven sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index reflect positive y-o-y revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 with five of them estimated to surpass 5.0%. For comparison, ten of the eleven sectors are estimated to see revenue growth in 2025.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: In our view, the Index&rsquo;s year-to-date total return of 25.82% can be explained, in part, by the estimated earnings and revenue growth rates revealed in today&rsquo;s table. Since our last post on this topic, six of the 11 sectors that comprise the Index saw their 2024 earnings and revenue estimates increase. With the U.S. Presidential election behind us, and the Federal Reserve having announced its second rate cut of the year, we believe investors would be well-served to retrain their focus on these two driving forces of equity valuations. Time will ultimately reveal the accuracy of these estimates, but we maintain that higher revenues could be the best catalyst for growing earnings, and in turn, drive equity valuations higher.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

For comparison, the Real Estate, Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Utilities sectors all suffered negative total returns over the same period in 2023. In our view, the Utilities sector stands out among its peers in this regard. After posting a total return of -7.08% (the worst performer) in 2023, the sector has enjoyed a stunning turnaround, notching a total return of 26.72% YTD thru 11/5, making it the third-best performing sector in the broader Index.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\"><strong>Click</strong> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\">here </a>to read our recent commentary on the Utilities space.

As revealed in the chart, when it comes to an investment in infrastructure stocks, water stands out above them all. Water plays a critical role in socio-economic development, the production of food and energy, and crucially, human survival itself. The United Nations reported that 2.2 billion people around the world lacked access to safely managed drinking water, and 3.5 billion did not have access to safely managed sanitation in 2022. We discuss what we believe have been catalysts to growth for the companies involved in water utility, infrastructure, materials, and equipment below.</p> <ul> <li>In the U.S., an estimated 2 million people currently live without running water inside their homes. While most U.S. citizens have access to clean water and sanitation, the infrastructure that provides these services is aging. The pipe that makes up the U.S. water network is 45 years old, on average. Some of the oldest cast iron pipes still in use were put in service more than 100 years ago, according to McKinsey &amp; Company.<br><br></li> <li>The U.S. drinking water infrastructure is comprised of 2.2 million miles of underground pipe, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The ASCE noted that an estimated 6 billion gallons of treated potable water is lost through leaks in this piping infrastructure each day. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expects water-pipe replacement rates to peak in 2035, with somewhere between 16,000 to 20,000 miles of piping being replaced per year.<br><br></li> <li>We&rsquo;ve written about estimated impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the energy grid in previous posts (<strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></strong>), but AI&rsquo;s demand for water cannot be understated. A recent report by J.P. Morgan revealed that large data centers use as much as 5 million gallons of water per day to effectively cool the chipsets that process AI intensive workloads. Notably, the U.S. was home to 5,381 data centers at the end of March 2024. For comparison, Germany, the U.K., and China were home to just 1,484 data centers combined as of the same date.<br><br></li> <li>Funding for updated water infrastructure has accelerated in recent years. In 2021, the U.S. government revealed legislation that designated $55 billion toward water infrastructure improvements. Fifteen billion dollars of that funding was set aside to replace each of the 9.2 million lead service lines still in use, by 2031. In October 2024, the EPA announced $6.2 billion in additional funding to upgrade U.S. water infrastructure.<br><br></li> <li>The cumulative total returns of each of the indices in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows: S&amp;P 500 Index (68.23%), S&amp;P Global Water Index (47.27%), S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index (42.96%), ISE Global Wind Energy Index (21.60%), S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index (-24.08%), and the MAC Global Solar Energy Index (-42.27%).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: From our perspective, the results in today&rsquo;s chart can be explained by the crucial role that access to clean water and proper sanitation play in developed and developing nations around the world. Globally, an estimated $1.37 trillion of additional water infrastructure investments are required to provide clean water to the 2.2 billion people currently in need of it by 2030. In the U.S., our aging water infrastructure is in dire need of repair and replacement, with 6 billion gallons of treated water being lost each day to leaks in the current framework (approximately 14%-18% of U.S. daily water usage). Additionally, data centers are estimated to use an increasing share of available water to cool the chipsets that process AI workloads, which stands to stress these systems even further. Given the critical nature of the water ecosystem in comparison to the other infrastructure investments shown in today&rsquo;s chart, we do not find the sector&rsquo;s outperformance overly surprising. While there is no way to be certain, we expect these companies will continue to benefit from the global construction and domestic modernization of water infrastructure.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Today&rsquo;s post serves as an update to our previous observations. The chart above includes the price-only returns of the largest 100 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index (the S&amp;P 100 Index), the S&amp;P 500 Index, and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index normalized to a factor of 100.</p> <ul> <li>On 7/8/24, prior to Powell&rsquo;s address, the federal funds rate futures market indicated there was a 72.0% chance that the Fed would cut its policy rate at its September meeting. That expectation surged following his remarks, rising to 98.0% on 7/23/24.<br><br></li> <li>As we now know, the Fed cut its policy rate by 50 basis points in September, lowering the federal funds target rate (upper bound) from 5.50% to 5.00%.<br><br></li> <li>Historically, the Fed&rsquo;s policy rate has nearly matched the rate of inflation.<br>&nbsp;<br> <ul> <li>Over the 30-year period ended 9/30/24, the federal funds target rate (upper bound) averaged 2.58% on a monthly basis. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) averaged 2.5% over the same time frame.<br><br></li> <li>The federal funds target rate (upper bound) stood at 5.00% at the end of September, well above September&rsquo;s CPI reading of 2.4%.<br><br></li> </ul> </li> <li>Valuations for small cap stocks appear to be more attractive than their large cap counterparts. In fact, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index currently sits at 16.80 compared to its 10-year average of 24.63 (as of 10/28). For comparison, the P/E ratios of the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500 Indices stood at 26.41 and 24.97, above their 10-year monthly averages of 21.09 and 21.36 as of the same date. Notably, year-over-year earnings for the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index are estimated to decline by 8.53% in 2024 before becoming increasingly favorable the following year. In 2025, earnings are estimated to increase by 16.99% for the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index, compared to 13.38% and 13.62%, respectively, for the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500 Indices.<br><br></li> <li>For reference, the price only returns for the indices in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows (7/10/24 &ndash; 10/25/24): S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index (7.35%), S&amp;P 500 Index (3.09%), S&amp;P 100 Index (1.89%).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: As noted in our previous post on this topic, smaller companies are often more reliant on outside capital than their larger counterparts, who generally operate in a state of going concern. Given that equity valuations can vary based on the cost of raising said capital (internally or externally), we expect further easing in monetary policy to have an outsized impact on small cap valuations relative to other market capitalizations. Another noteworthy point is that the spread between the federal funds target rate (upper bound) and the CPI remains well-above historical norms. We anticipate small cap valuations could benefit from a narrowing of that spread, over time. That said, there are mounting concerns that the Fed&rsquo;s initial cut may have been too deep. Case-in-point: the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that non-farm payrolls increased by 254,000 in September, well above the consensus expected 150,000. In the U.S., real GDP growth was unrevised at 3.0% in Q2&rsquo;24, but Gross Domestic Income, an alternative measure of economic activity, was revised upward from 1.3% to 3.4%. Given the Fed&rsquo;s data-dependency, a strong U.S. economic outlook may prove to be a headwind to small cap valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

For comparison, we included results and estimates from the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;LargeCap Index&rdquo;), the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index (&ldquo;MidCap Index&rdquo;) and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index (&ldquo;SmallCap Index&rdquo;).</p> <p><strong>As anticipated in our previous post on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/3/26/corporate-earnings-estimates-signal-strength-ahead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here to view</a>), each of the Indices in today&rsquo;s charts saw earnings decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in Q1 and Q2 of 2024. That said, the early year contraction is expected to be short-lived, with year-over-year (y-o-y) comparisons reflecting favorably for each of the three Indices in Q1&rsquo;25.</strong></p> <p>SmallCap Index earnings declined by 9.91% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;24 but are estimated to increase by 3.53% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;25. Earnings for the MidCap Index declined by 5.15% y-o-y in Q4&rsquo;23 but are expected to increase by 0.94% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;25.

For today&rsquo;s publication, we wanted to provide an alternative look at the data that informs this thought process, as well as an extended view into the mid and small-cap segments of the market. We believe that corporate earnings drive the direction of stock prices over time, especially when the major indices are trading at or near record highs. As the data shows, EPS are expected to trend higher across each of these indices over the next several quarters, with full year estimates reaching record-highs for the LargeCap and MidCap Indices in 2025. As always, these are estimates and are subject to change (and have changed since our last post). That said, we trust today&rsquo;s publication provides a unique perspective on what we view as a major catalyst of the recent surge in equity valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

For today&rsquo;s post (and the previous posts in this series), we set out to determine if that outperformance also exists during periods of high inflation. To construct the table above, we started in 1990 and selected calendar years where inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by 3.0% or more on a trailing 12-month basis. We chose 3.0% as our baseline because the rate of change in the CPI averaged 3.0% from 1926-2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We then selected three defensive sectors (Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities) and compared their total returns to those of the S&amp;P 500 Index over those periods.</p> <ul> <li><strong>While the CPI remains above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target rate of 2.0%, it has fallen below the target level of 3.0% we use for this post. Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index has been the top performer year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&amp;P 500 Index by 7.12 percentage points through 10/15/24.</strong></li> </ul> <p>One reason for Utilities&rsquo; continued outperformance in 2024 is the rise in global usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The International Energy Agency reported that the global electricity consumed by data centers, which typically house the servers that host AI graphics processing units, is forecast to surge from an estimated 460 terra-watt hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terra-watt hours in 2026. For comparison, this demand is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan. We have posted on this subject recently (<a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/3/the-only-constant-is-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a> to view &ldquo;The Only Constant is Change&rdquo;), but it warrants repeating that U.S. data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from just 3% in 2022.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Of the eleven time frames in the table where inflation increased by 3.0% or more on a trailing 12-month basis, there were only two (2021 and 2023) where the S&amp;P 500 Index outperformed each of the Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities sectors.</strong><br><br></li> <li><strong>From 12/29/89 &ndash; 10/15/24 (period captured in the table above), the average annualized total returns posted by the four equity indices presented were as follows (best to worst): 11.66% (S&amp;P 500 Health Care); 10.64% (S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples); 10.61% (S&amp;P 500 Index); and 8.51% (S&amp;P 500 Utilities), according to data from Bloomberg.</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Despite recent disinflation, the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index continues to lead the broader S&amp;P 500 Index by a significant margin YTD. We think improving earnings estimates, surging demand for electricity resulting from increased AI adoption, and recent economic volatility may account for the sector&rsquo;s outperformance. On 10/11/24 data from Bloomberg revealed that earnings for S&amp;P 500 Utilities companies are estimated to increase by 14.6% and 9.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. For comparison, those same estimates stood at 8.5% and 7.4%, respectively, on 12/29/23. While forecasts vary for the effect of AI on global electricity consumption, the impact is not likely to be subtle. We think the increase in earnings estimates reflect these expectations. Additionally, recent economic data and geopolitical strife may have prompted investors to utilize defensive sectors as a safe haven. In early October, concerns that the Federal Reserve had cut rates too deeply mounted when non-farm payrolls surpassed all expectations, increasing by 254,000 in September. Notably, the news came on the heels of an August report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics which revised payrolls downward by 818,000 over the 12-month period ended March 2024. From our perspective, investor interest in defensive sectors may remain strong in light of geopolitical strife, economic volatility, and the potential for a resurgence in the pace of rising prices.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Apart from Q3&rsquo;22, Q2&rsquo;23, and Q1&rsquo;24, dividend distributions steadily increased over today&rsquo;s set of observations. In contrast, share buybacks continue to account for a larger share of total capital disbursements despite greater variance.</p> <ul> <li>Combined, stock dividends and share buybacks totaled $1.481 trillion (preliminary data) over the trailing 12-month period ended June 2024, up from $1.389 trillion over the same period last year.</li> <li>Dividend distributions totaled $153.4 billion in Q2&rsquo;24, up from $151.6 billion in Q1&rsquo;24. In total, the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) distributed a record $603.3 billion as dividends over the trailing 12-month period ended in June 2024, up from $576.4 billion over the same period last year.</li> <li>Stock buybacks totaled $235.9 billion in Q2&rsquo;24 (preliminary data), down from $236.8 billion in Q1&rsquo;24.

Despite a slight contraction in Q1&rsquo;24, the Index&rsquo;s dividend distributions increased to a record $603.3 billion over the trailing 12-months ended June 2024. Year-to-date through 9/30/24, there were eleven dividend cuts and two suspensions in the Index compared to twenty cuts and four suspensions from January through September of last year. Buybacks declined slightly during the quarter, totaling $235.9 billion. When ranked by total buyback expenditures, the top 20 companies in the Index accounted for 52.3% of all share buybacks in Q2&rsquo;24, up from 50.9% in the previous quarter.

To do so we plotted the price returns of the three best and worst performing sectors between 7/9/24 to 10/8/24. We chose 7/9/24 as our starting point because on that day Federal Reserve (&ldquo;Fed&rdquo;) chair Jerome Powell testified to Congress that the U.S. economy was no longer overheated, and that keeping interest rates too high for too long could jeopardize economic growth. On 9/18/24, just over two months later, the Fed voted to reduce its target rate by 50 basis points, setting the rate at 5.00% (upper bound).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, sector performance underwent a seismic shift in the wake of the Fed&rsquo;s comments and subsequent reduction in the policy rate. The total returns for the six sectors in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows (7/9/24 &ndash; 10/8/24):</strong></p> <ul> <li>S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index: 16.37%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Real Estate Index: 13.64%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Industrials Index: 12.37%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index: 6.07%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index: -0.75%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index: -2.03</li> </ul> <p><strong>For comparison, the total returns for these same sectors between 12/29/23 to 7/9/24 were as follows:</strong></p> <ul> <li>S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index: 34.21 %</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index: 30.42%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index: 10.47%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index: 9.63%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Industrials Index: 6.82%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Real Estate Index: -2.46%</li> </ul> <p><strong>Investor expectations regarding the depth of the Fed&rsquo;s interest rate cuts changed substantially since the end of June.</strong></p> <p>On 6/28/24 the federal funds futures market implied that the federal funds target rate would stand at 4.89% on 12/18/24 (the date of the Fed&rsquo;s final meeting in 2024). As of 10/8/24, that same futures market revealed that investors expect interest rates will decline to 4.33% by the Fed&rsquo;s final meeting of the year and may fall as low as 3.36% by the end of 2025.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: As many investors are aware, the sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) often exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Prior to the Fed&rsquo;s commentary in early July, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology and Communication Services Indices were the top performing sectors in the broader Index in 2024. Notably, those same sectors have been the worst performers in the Index since Powell&rsquo;s speech in July, declining by 2.03% and 0.75%, respectively, between 7/9/24 and 10/8/24. By contrast, Utilities and Real Estate, two of the more interest rate sensitive sectors in the Index, surged by 16.37% and 13.64%, respectively, over the same time frame. From our perspective, this dramatic change in performance can be explained, in part, by increasing expectations (and the eventual reality) of U.S. interest rate cuts. That said, the Fed is admittedly data-dependent when it comes to their policy decisions. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 254,000 in September 2024, well above the projected total of 140,000. Investors will want to keep close watch on U.S. economic data, in our opinion. Should the U.S. economy remain robust, the Fed may decide to adjust the timing of interest rate cuts to avoid reigniting inflation.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Today&rsquo;s blog post is one that we update each quarter to lend context to our responses. Sometimes the answer is more evident than at other times, and sometimes it only makes sense via hindsight. While the above chart does not contain yearly data, only two sectors in the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) have been the top-performer in back-to-back calendar years since 2005. Information Technology was the first, posting the highest total return in 2019 (+50.29%) and 2020 (43.89%). Energy was the second, posting the highest total return in 2021 (54.39%) and 2022 (65.43%), according to data from Bloomberg.</p> <ul> <li>The top-performing sectors and their total returns in Q3&rsquo;24 were as follows: Utilities (19.37%), Real Estate (17.17%), and Industrials (11.55%). The total return for the Index was 5.89% over the period. The other eight sectors generated total returns ranging from 10.66% (Financials) to -2.32% (Energy).<br><br></li> <li>By comparison, the total returns of the top performing sectors in Q3 of last year were as follows: Energy (12.22%), Communication Services (3.07%), and Financials (-1.13%). The worst-performing sectors for the period were: Consumer Staples (-5.97%), Real Estate (-8.90%), and Utilities (-9.25%).<br><br></li> <li>Notably, Information Technology and Communication Services, the two top sectors last quarter, were not among the leaders in the most recent quarter. In fact, with total returns of 1.68% and 1.61%, respectively, the Communication Services and Information Technology sectors were among the worst performing sectors over the time frame. Only Energy fared worse, with a total return of -2.32% over the period.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2023/10/3/the-only-constant-is-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here</a> to access the post featuring the top-performing sectors in Q4&rsquo;22, Q1'23, Q2'23 and Q3&rsquo;23.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: As we observe in today&rsquo;s chart, the top-performing sector often varies from quarter to quarter. Of the eleven sectors that make up the Index, the Information Technology and Communication Services Indices boast the highest total returns on a trailing 12-month basis (52.68% and 42.91%, respectively). That said, the Utilities sector increased by 19.37% (total return) in the most recent quarter and is now the top performing sector in the Index year-to-date, with a total return of 30.63% (thru 9/30). The cash flows provided by utility companies are generally very stable, making them compelling investments in times of volatility, in our opinion. The looming U.S. election, growing economic headwinds, and the sharp rise in geopolitical risk may be among the factors driving increased interest in the sector. Surging earnings expectations may be another. Bloomberg reported that by 2034, global energy consumption by data centers is expected to exceed 1,580 terrawatt-hours, or nearly as much power as all of India. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs. Earnings estimates increased alongside these demand forecasts. On 12/29/23, the 2024 and 2025 earnings growth rate estimates for the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index were 8.5% and 7.4%, respectively. On 9/27/24, those estimates stood at 14.5% (2024) and 9.1% (2025). Will a different sector rise to the top in the fourth quarter of 2024? We look forward to seeing what the data reveals.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Since precious metals tend to be priced in U.S. dollars, we also included a column that tracks the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major currencies.</p> <ul> <li>Precious metals have historically been considered potential inflation hedges by investors. From 1926-2023, the 12-month rate of change on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) averaged 3.0%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It stood at 2.5% at the end of August 2024, down from its most-recent high of 9.1% set in June 2022.<br><br></li> <li>The price of gold has been trending upward. The spot price of one ounce of gold stood at a record $2,670.40 on 9/26/24. It closed at $2,636.10 on 9/30/24, representing an increase of 27.24% year-to-date (YTD), according to data from Bloomberg.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>The spot price of silver also increased over the same time frame. The spot price of one ounce of silver surged by 30.90% YTD thru 9/30/24. That said, unlike gold, the spot price of silver has not recovered to its all-time high. The price of one ounce of silver stood at $31.15 on 9/30/24, below its all-time high of $49.45 set on 1/18/80.<br><br></li> <li>The spot price of the U.S. Dollar Index declined by 0.55% YTD through 9/30/24.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>From 2009 through 2023, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold &amp; Silver Index posted a positive total return in seven of the 15 calendar years. Five of them occurred from 2016 through 2023. It is solidly in positive territory YTD.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: In some ways the data presented today may seem counter intuitive. If the CPI is down 6.6 percentage points from its most-recent high, then why are these traditional inflation hedges trending higher? From our perspective, there are several catalysts at play. First, many investors view the U.S. dollar, gold, silver, and other precious metals as safe havens during times of economic turmoil. In last week&rsquo;s post, we noted that weaker than expected employment data may foreshadow softer U.S. economic activity in the coming quarters. Second, geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing war between Russia/Ukraine and continued escalation in the Middle East pose significant risks to near-term growth. Finally, investors may be utilizing these commodities as a haven against a possible resurgence in inflation. This threat has the potential to build over time should the world&rsquo;s central banks continue to embark on more accommodative policies. We expect the recent surge in the valuations of safe haven assets may continue if these risks remain elevated.</strong><br><br><em>The chart and performance data referenced are for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The decision was highly anticipated and marks the first reduction to the federal funds target rate since March 15, 2020. In today&rsquo;s post, we review the price of the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) during previous rate cut environments and set out to determine what factors may have impacted equity valuations during those time frames. To do so, we charted the price return of the Index alongside the federal funds target rate (upper bound) over the 25-year period ended September 24, 2024.</p> <p><strong>There were three previous cycles where the Fed reduced its policy rate in today&rsquo;s chart (not including the most recent reduction). As the chart reveals, the Index&rsquo;s price declined over each time frame.</strong></p> <p>The Index&rsquo;s total return over the period spanning the first to the last rate cut of each cycle was as follows:&nbsp;</p> <p>Index total return (1/3/01 &ndash; 6/25/03): -24.82%<br>Index total return (9/18/07 &ndash; 12/16/08): -38.16%<br>Index total return (7/31/2019 &ndash; 3/13/20): -7.86%</p> <p>The U.S. economy experienced significant, but unique headwinds throughout each of these reduction cycles. In 2001, the U.S. equity markets, already ailing from the bursting of the dot com bubble, came to a standstill as terrorists attacked on 9/11. In 2007, the &ldquo;Great Recession&rdquo; took root, its genesis found in the collapse of sub-prime mortgages. Then there was the global pandemic, which began in 2019, effectively halting all non-essential economic activity.</p> <p><strong>Notably, earnings for the companies that comprise the Index declined during these three periods.</strong></p> <p>In 2000, actual Index earnings totaled $55.70, according to data from Bloomberg. By 2002, actual earnings had declined to $40.49, and would not increase above $55.70 until 2004. A similar pattern emerged over the next rate cut cycle. Index earnings plummeted from $94.34 in 2007 to $58.25 in 2009. They would not fully recover until 2011. While COVID&rsquo;s impact on the equity markets was short-lived, earnings once again offer a reliable proxy to the Index&rsquo;s return. Actual earnings reported by the companies in the Index totaled $163.57, $142.80, and $198.22 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: We maintain that earnings and revenue growth are fundamental to higher equity valuations (click here to view our recent post on this topic). As of September 20, 2024, Bloomberg&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings growth estimates for the Index stood at 9.34% and 14.34%, respectively. Very healthy, in our opinion. Despite these estimates, economic headwinds have materialized. In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. added 818,000 fewer jobs than originally forecast over the 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024. The news came on the heels of lackluster employment data in July as well. Given that The U.S. derives nearly two-thirds of GDP from consumer spending, an increase in the unemployment rate could threaten economic growth and may be one of the motivations for last week&rsquo;s rate cut. Earnings estimates could be adjusted lower should the economy falter and companies suffer declining revenues. That said, if earnings estimates hold and economic growth continues, we believe equities stand to benefit.</strong></p> <p><em>This table is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that housing starts increased by 9.6% in August 2024, to an annual rate of 1.356 million, compared to the consensus expected annual rate of 1.318 million. New building permits increased as well, rising to an annual rate of 1.475 million (compared to estimates of 1.410 million). That said, the pace of housing starts remains below the levels seen in 2021-2023, according to Brian Wesbury, Chief Economist at First Trust Portfolios, LP.</p> <p><strong>The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Index (Homebuilders Index) increased by 20.36% on a total return basis since the start of the third quarter alone (thru 9/18).&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The surge in the Homebuilders Index occurred despite the continued headwinds to housing starts and building permits we mentioned above. For comparison, the Homebuilders Index increased by 6.27% on a total return basis in the first half of 2024. From our perspective, one catalyst for the increase in valuations has been the increasing likelihood of multiple cuts to the federal funds target rate throughout the remainder of the year.</p> <p><strong>A lower federal funds rate translates to lower mortgage and construction financing rates, which could spur increased investment in housing.</strong></p> <p>As of 9/18/24, the national average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage stood at 6.31% according to Bankrate. This is the lowest the national average has been since February of this year.</p> <p><strong>Housing inventory remains below historical averages.</strong></p> <p>According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, there were only 829,000 vacant housing units for sale in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter. For comparison, there have been 1.395 million vacant homes for sale, on average, on a quarterly basis since the second quarter of 2000. Given current supply constraints as well as the potential for lower interest rates over the near term, we expect demand for the construction of new homes to rise even further.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: The Homebuilders Index has enjoyed a remarkable start to the third quarter, increasing by 20.36% on a total return basis from 6/28 thru 9/18. From our perspective, the Fed&rsquo;s announcement that it was slashing the federal funds target rate by 50 bps, the continued drought in supply, and pent-up demand from potential buyers waiting for lower mortgage rates is likely to lead to further increases in the demand for new homes. In our view, homebuilders could benefit as tailwinds to homebuying continue to develop.</strong></p> <p><em>This table is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Given that consumer spending has historically accounted for roughly two-thirds of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, we think the performance of consumer stocks can offer insight into potential trends in the broader economy.</p> <p><strong>The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Indices increased by 14.07% and 21.92% (total return) over the trailing 12-months ended 9/13.</strong></p> <p>The last time we posted on this topic (click here), consumer staples stocks had lagged consumer discretionary companies by a significant margin over the trailing 12-month period. That is no longer the case. We think the year-to-date (YTD) and 1-year performance margins between the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Indices in the table can be explained, in part, by the increasing possibility of a near term recession. Just after equity markets began digesting July&rsquo;s lackluster manufacturing and employment data, August&rsquo;s report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the U.S. added 818,000 fewer jobs than originally forecast over the 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024, likely paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its meeting this week.</p> <p><strong>Just how healthy is the U.S. consumer?</strong></p> <p>Real consumer discretionary spending stood at $6.51 trillion YTD thru July, an increase of 3.0% from $6.32 trillion over the same period last year. Consumer sentiment remains strong. Preliminary results from the University of Michigan revealed that consumer sentiment increased by 1.8% year-over-year in September and remains nearly 40% higher than its most recent low set in June 2022. While discretionary spending and consumer sentiment are rising, so is U.S. household debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that aggregate household debt balances increased by $109 billion in Q2&rsquo;24, to $17.80 trillion. Delinquencies are rising. The share of credit card balances that were seriously delinquent (90+ days) stood at 10.9% in Q2&rsquo;24, its highest level since Q1&rsquo;12. As a further pressure, savings rates are dwindling. The U.S. personal savings rate stood at 2.9% in July 2024, down from 4.4% in July 2023.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: Many investors view consumer staples stocks as a refuge during periods of heightened volatility. From our perspective, weaker than expected economic data combined with expanding consumer debt balances, rising delinquency rates, and plummeting personal savings rates may explain the widening performance differential between consumer staples and discretionary stocks presented in today&rsquo;s table. That said, investors would be well-served to keep the full picture in mind. The Federal Reserve reported that U.S. household net worth stood at a record $163.8 trillion at the end of Q2&rsquo;24, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, inflation, as measured by the 12-month rate of change in the consumer price index stood at 2.5% in August, down significantly from its most recent high of 9.1% in June 2022. Disinflation has been a welcome relief to many Americans who, stretched thin by rising interest rates, plummeting savings, and elevated credit card debt, are a significant driver of economic growth. Should the consumer remain healthy, the possibility of the U.S. experiencing a notable recession could be diminished.

On September 9, 2024, the Index closed at 5,471.05, representing an increase of 14.70% on a price-only basis from when it closed at 4,769.83 on December 29, 2023, according to data from Bloomberg. For comparison, from 1928-2023 (96 years) the Index posted an average annual total return of 9.56%. In our post on this topic from October 2023 (click here), we wrote that increased revenues could boost earnings and provide the catalyst for higher equity valuations going forward. We believe that the Index&rsquo;s notable surge over the past months is reflective, in part, of that scenario playing out.</p> <p><strong>Current estimates reveal favorable earnings growth expectations.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>As today&rsquo;s table shows, the earnings for the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index are estimated to increase by a combined 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year (y-o-y) basis in 2024 and 2025. These figures are higher than when they stood at 9.4% and 13.8%, respectively, the last time we posted on this topic (<strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/5/21/sp-500-index-earnings--revenue-growth-rate-estimates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></strong>). Keep in mind that estimates for 2024 reflect favorable comparisons to 2023&rsquo;s earnings which declined by 0.9% in 2023 (not in table). In 2024, earnings are estimated to decline in just two of the eleven sectors that comprise the Index (Energy and Materials). The Energy sector&rsquo;s 2024 earnings estimates declined substantially since our last post, falling from -5.4% to -12.6%. From our perspective, the decline in earnings estimates is likely reflective of plummeting oil and gas prices. The price of WTI crude oil stood at $68.71 per barrel on September 9, 2024, down 21.48% on a year-over-year (y-o-y) basis, according to data from Bloomberg. The price of natural gas stood at $2.17 per million BTUs as of the same date, down 16.70% y-o-y.</p> <p><strong>Revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 and 2025 are also favorable.</strong></p> <p>As of September 6, the estimated revenue growth rate for companies in the Index stood at 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025. These figures have increased since our last post (they were 4.5% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025, at that time). Nine of the eleven sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index reflect positive y-o-y revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 with five of them estimated to surpass 5.0%.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: We think the recent surge in the S&amp;P 500 Index, which increased by 15.82% on a total return basis year-to-date through September 9, can be explained, in part, by the expected earnings and revenue growth rates revealed in today&rsquo;s table. Additionally, it appears highly likely that the Federal Reserve will initiate multiple cuts to the federal funds rate before the end of this year. A lower discount rate could translate into higher equity valuations. That said, information flows quickly, and these estimates are subject to constant revision. Time will ultimately reveal their accuracy, but we maintain that higher revenues in the coming years could be the best catalyst for growing earnings, and in turn, lead to higher equity valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

While quarterly earnings estimates provide a view into the expected financial performance of a given company, they are not guarantees, and equity analysts continually adjust their estimates as new information is obtained. That said, from Q3&rsquo;20 through Q3'24 (the 17 quarters in today&rsquo;s chart), the average earnings beat rate for the companies that comprise the Index was 77.6%.</p> <p><strong>As of 11/20/24, the sectors with the highest Q3&rsquo;24 earnings beat rates and their percentages were as follows: Information Technology (87.5%); Health Care (83.3%); Financials (77.5%); and Consumer Staples (77.4%), according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Real Estate had the lowest beat rate at 45.2%, while Materials had the highest earnings miss rate (46.4%) over the quarter.</strong></p> <p><strong>As indicated in today&rsquo;s chart, the percentage of companies in the Index that reported higher than expected earnings in Q3&rsquo;24 (71.7%) stood 5.9 percentage points below the 4-year average of 77.6%.</strong></p> <p>Per the chart, this is not unusual. The Index&rsquo;s earnings beat rate exceeded the average in just seven of the 17 quarters presented. More recently, the Index&rsquo;s beat rate exceeded the average in just two of the past eight consecutive quarters. Keep in mind that the Q3&rsquo;24 data in the chart reflects earnings results for 470 of the 503 companies that comprise the Index and could change in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>FactSet reported that the blended, year-over-year (y-o-y) earnings growth rate for the Index stood at 5.8% as of 11/22/24.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>If the metric remains positive, it will mark the fifth consecutive quarter of y-o-y earnings growth. For comparison, the y-o-y earnings growth rates for Q1&rsquo;24 and Q2&rsquo;24 were 5.8% and 11.2%, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: While earnings beats are generally viewed as positive for the overall market, they represent just one piece of an intricate puzzle. As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, the earnings beat rate for the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index has been below the average in most of the time frames presented (including the most recent quarter). Despite this fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 5,969.34 on 11/22/24, representing an increase of 66.9% on a price only basis from its most recent low of 3,577.03 (10/12/22). From our perspective, persistent earnings growth has been a key catalyst to higher equity valuations. Case-in-point, the Q3&rsquo;24 blended (y-o-y) earnings growth rate for the Index was 5.8% on 11/22/24. While that is below the 5-year and 10-year averages of 10.0% and 8.5%, respectively, it represents the fifth consecutive quarter of y-o-y earnings growth for the Index. Additionally, earnings are estimated to rise substantially over the coming quarters. FactSet reported that analysts estimate the Index&rsquo;s earnings will increase by 12.0%, 12.7%, 12.1%, and 15.3% in Q4&rsquo;24, Q1&rsquo;25, Q2&rsquo;25 and Q3&rsquo;25, respectively.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The practice is so common that 403 of the 503 constituents in the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;the Index&rdquo;) distributed a cash dividend to their equity owners as of 11/14/24. In addition to acting as a conduit for the return of capital, dividend distributions account for a significant portion of the Index&rsquo;s total return. According to data from Bloomberg, dividends contributed to over 37% of the total return of the Index over the 96-year period between December 30, 1927, and December 29, 2023.</p> <ul> <li>Dividend payments from S&amp;P500 Index constituents totaled $70.91 per share (record high) in 2023, up from $67.57 (previous record high) in 2022.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>As of 11/18/24, dividend payments are estimated to total $77.24 and $81.68 per share in 2024 and 2025, up from $74.54 and $79.66 per share in 2024 and 2025, respectively, on 1/31/24.</li> <li>Of the 11 major sectors that comprise the Index, eight of them had yields above the 1.26% generated by the Index over the period captured in the table. Financials, Information Technology, and Health Care contributed the most to the Index's dividend payout at 15.63%, 15.45% and 14.10%, respectively.<br><br></li> <li>The payout ratio for the S&amp;P 500 Index stood at 36.43% on 11/18/24. A dividend payout ratio between 30% and 60% is typically a good sign that a dividend distribution is sustainable, according to Nasdaq.<br><br></li> <li>Many investors view changes in dividend distributions as an indication of strength and or weakness in the underlying company. For that reason, companies will often avoid decreasing or suspending their dividend payout. There were a total of 12 dividend cuts and two suspensions year-to-date through the end of October. For comparison, 22 dividends were cut and four were suspended over the same period last year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Dividend distributions continue to be one of the most efficient methods by which companies can return capital to their shareholders. As such, investors often view consistent dividend payments and dividend increases as indications of strength. In the 96-year period between December 30, 1927, and December 29, 2023, more than 37% of the total return of the Index came from dividends. Remarkably, dividend growth estimates for the Index have increased since the start of the year. The Index&rsquo;s 2024 dividend payments were forecast to total a record $77.24 per share on 11/18/24, up from $74.54 per share on 1/31/24. Furthermore, dividend sustainability appears to have improved since 2023. Just 12 dividends were cut and two were suspended this year (through 10/31), down from 22 cuts and four suspensions through October 2023.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

As evidenced by recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, as well as the vast market for smartphones, tablets, and wearables, we continue to find creative and innovative ways to integrate semiconductors into our everyday lives.</p> <p><strong>Semiconductor sales appear to lag fluctuations in the valuations of technology stocks.</strong></p> <p>As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, changes in semiconductor sales typically occur after changes in the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index. This phenomenon continues to be true as of today&rsquo;s update to this post. Case in point, the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index increased to its third consecutive quarterly all time high at the end of September 2024. By contrast, prior to the most recent quarter, semiconductor sales hadn&rsquo;t posted a quarterly record since Q4&rsquo;21.</p> <p><strong>Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled a record $166.0 billion in Q3&rsquo;24, an increase of 23.2% from Q3&rsquo;23.</strong></p> <p>Amidst unprecedented demand, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that worldwide semiconductor sales surged by 26.2% to a record $555.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, sales increased to another record &nbsp;($574.1 billion), but had begun to stagnate in the second half of the year. In 2023, worldwide sales of semiconductors declined by 8.2% year-over-year to $526.8 billion. Since then, as evidenced by the third quarter&rsquo;s record, sales of semiconductors increased dramatically. Aggregate semiconductor sales totaled $456.7 billion year-to-date through 9/30/24, putting them within reach of 2022&rsquo;s record tally.</p> <p><strong>The technology sector continues to be a top performing sector compared to its peers.</strong></p> <p>Propelled forward by promising developments in AI and an easing in the global chip shortage, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index increased by 57.84% in 2023. In our view, these factors remain relevant today, and continue to entice investors to the sector. Year-to-date through 11/12/24, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index posted a total return of 36.34%, second only to the S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index which increased by 37.41% on a total return basis over the same time frame. Despite surging valuations, recent cuts to the federal funds rate appear to have made competing sectors more attractive to investors. Tellingly, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index increased by just 1.58% since 7/9/24, the day Jerome Powell testified that the U.S. economy was no longer overheated, making it the worst performing of all 11 subsectors that comprise the broader S&amp;P 500 Index over the period (7/9 thru 11/12).</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: It is nearly impossible to discuss semiconductors and technology stocks without mentioning developments in AI, and rightly so. One forecast suggests the global AI market could grow to nearly $600 billion by 2026 and $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Ryan Issakainen, ETF Strategist at First Trust Portfolios L.P. These estimates, coupled with resilient U.S. consumer spending, and increasing demand for semiconductors have served as potent catalysts to technology stocks over the past several years. Despite record technology sector valuations, global semiconductor sales remain below their all-time yearly high set in 2022. That said, increased demand for AI-related chips resulted in record semiconductor sales in Q3&rsquo;24. Should that trend continue, 2024 could be a record setting year for sales in the space.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Keep in mind that estimates for 2024 reflect favorable comparisons to 2023&rsquo;s earnings which declined by 0.9% in 2023 (not in table). In 2024, earnings are now estimated to decline in three of the eleven sectors that comprise the Index (Energy, Industrials, and Materials), up from just two in our last post. The Energy sector&rsquo;s 2024 earnings estimates continued to decline, falling from -12.6% in our last post to -19.0%. From our perspective, the decline in earnings estimates is likely reflective of plummeting oil and gas prices. The price of WTI crude oil stood at $68.04 per barrel on November 11, 2024, down 11.83% y-o-y, according to data from Bloomberg. The price of natural gas stood at $2.92 per million BTUs as of the same date, down 3.73% y-o-y.</p> <p><strong>Revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 and 2025 remain favorable.</strong></p> <p>As of November 8, the estimated revenue growth rate for companies in the Index stood at 5.2% and 5.5%, respectively in 2024 and 2025. These figures are mixed since our last post when they stood at 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025. Nine of the eleven sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index reflect positive y-o-y revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 with five of them estimated to surpass 5.0%. For comparison, ten of the eleven sectors are estimated to see revenue growth in 2025.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: In our view, the Index&rsquo;s year-to-date total return of 25.82% can be explained, in part, by the estimated earnings and revenue growth rates revealed in today&rsquo;s table. Since our last post on this topic, six of the 11 sectors that comprise the Index saw their 2024 earnings and revenue estimates increase. With the U.S. Presidential election behind us, and the Federal Reserve having announced its second rate cut of the year, we believe investors would be well-served to retrain their focus on these two driving forces of equity valuations.

The S&amp;P 500 Index was comprised of 11 sectors and 126 subsectors as of 11/1/24, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The 15 worst-performing subsectors in today&rsquo;s chart posted total returns ranging from -6.64% (Health Care Services) to -61.30% (Drug Retail) over the period. <strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/8/8/worst-performing-sp-500-subsectors-ytd-thru-86\">Click here</a></strong> to view our last post on the worst performing subsectors.</p> <ul> <li>As indicated in the chart above, five of the 15 worst-performing subsectors came from the&nbsp; S&amp;P 500 Index Consumer Discretionary sector, followed by three subsectors from the Consumer Staples sector. Drug Retail, a subsector of the Consumer Staples sector was the worst performer, posting a total return of -61.30% for the period.&nbsp;</li> <li>Each of the 11 sectors that comprise the Index were positive on a year-to-date (YTD) basis through 11/5/24.

For comparison, the Real Estate, Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Utilities sectors all suffered negative total returns over the same period in 2023. In our view, the Utilities sector stands out among its peers in this regard. After posting a total return of -7.08% (the worst performer) in 2023, the sector has enjoyed a stunning turnaround, notching a total return of 26.72% YTD thru 11/5, making it the third-best performing sector in the broader Index.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\"><strong>Click</strong> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\">here </a>to read our recent commentary on the Utilities space.

As revealed in the chart, when it comes to an investment in infrastructure stocks, water stands out above them all. Water plays a critical role in socio-economic development, the production of food and energy, and crucially, human survival itself. The United Nations reported that 2.2 billion people around the world lacked access to safely managed drinking water, and 3.5 billion did not have access to safely managed sanitation in 2022. We discuss what we believe have been catalysts to growth for the companies involved in water utility, infrastructure, materials, and equipment below.</p> <ul> <li>In the U.S., an estimated 2 million people currently live without running water inside their homes. While most U.S. citizens have access to clean water and sanitation, the infrastructure that provides these services is aging. The pipe that makes up the U.S. water network is 45 years old, on average. Some of the oldest cast iron pipes still in use were put in service more than 100 years ago, according to McKinsey &amp; Company.<br><br></li> <li>The U.S. drinking water infrastructure is comprised of 2.2 million miles of underground pipe, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The ASCE noted that an estimated 6 billion gallons of treated potable water is lost through leaks in this piping infrastructure each day. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expects water-pipe replacement rates to peak in 2035, with somewhere between 16,000 to 20,000 miles of piping being replaced per year.<br><br></li> <li>We&rsquo;ve written about estimated impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the energy grid in previous posts (<strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/17/defensive-sectors-and-elevated-inflation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></strong>), but AI&rsquo;s demand for water cannot be understated. A recent report by J.P. Morgan revealed that large data centers use as much as 5 million gallons of water per day to effectively cool the chipsets that process AI intensive workloads. Notably, the U.S. was home to 5,381 data centers at the end of March 2024. For comparison, Germany, the U.K., and China were home to just 1,484 data centers combined as of the same date.<br><br></li> <li>Funding for updated water infrastructure has accelerated in recent years. In 2021, the U.S. government revealed legislation that designated $55 billion toward water infrastructure improvements. Fifteen billion dollars of that funding was set aside to replace each of the 9.2 million lead service lines still in use, by 2031. In October 2024, the EPA announced $6.2 billion in additional funding to upgrade U.S. water infrastructure.<br><br></li> <li>The cumulative total returns of each of the indices in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows: S&amp;P 500 Index (68.23%), S&amp;P Global Water Index (47.27%), S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index (42.96%), ISE Global Wind Energy Index (21.60%), S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index (-24.08%), and the MAC Global Solar Energy Index (-42.27%).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: From our perspective, the results in today&rsquo;s chart can be explained by the crucial role that access to clean water and proper sanitation play in developed and developing nations around the world. Globally, an estimated $1.37 trillion of additional water infrastructure investments are required to provide clean water to the 2.2 billion people currently in need of it by 2030. In the U.S., our aging water infrastructure is in dire need of repair and replacement, with 6 billion gallons of treated water being lost each day to leaks in the current framework (approximately 14%-18% of U.S. daily water usage). Additionally, data centers are estimated to use an increasing share of available water to cool the chipsets that process AI workloads, which stands to stress these systems even further. Given the critical nature of the water ecosystem in comparison to the other infrastructure investments shown in today&rsquo;s chart, we do not find the sector&rsquo;s outperformance overly surprising. While there is no way to be certain, we expect these companies will continue to benefit from the global construction and domestic modernization of water infrastructure.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Today&rsquo;s post serves as an update to our previous observations. The chart above includes the price-only returns of the largest 100 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index (the S&amp;P 100 Index), the S&amp;P 500 Index, and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index normalized to a factor of 100.</p> <ul> <li>On 7/8/24, prior to Powell&rsquo;s address, the federal funds rate futures market indicated there was a 72.0% chance that the Fed would cut its policy rate at its September meeting. That expectation surged following his remarks, rising to 98.0% on 7/23/24.<br><br></li> <li>As we now know, the Fed cut its policy rate by 50 basis points in September, lowering the federal funds target rate (upper bound) from 5.50% to 5.00%.<br><br></li> <li>Historically, the Fed&rsquo;s policy rate has nearly matched the rate of inflation.<br>&nbsp;<br> <ul> <li>Over the 30-year period ended 9/30/24, the federal funds target rate (upper bound) averaged 2.58% on a monthly basis. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) averaged 2.5% over the same time frame.<br><br></li> <li>The federal funds target rate (upper bound) stood at 5.00% at the end of September, well above September&rsquo;s CPI reading of 2.4%.<br><br></li> </ul> </li> <li>Valuations for small cap stocks appear to be more attractive than their large cap counterparts. In fact, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index currently sits at 16.80 compared to its 10-year average of 24.63 (as of 10/28). For comparison, the P/E ratios of the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500 Indices stood at 26.41 and 24.97, above their 10-year monthly averages of 21.09 and 21.36 as of the same date. Notably, year-over-year earnings for the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index are estimated to decline by 8.53% in 2024 before becoming increasingly favorable the following year. In 2025, earnings are estimated to increase by 16.99% for the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index, compared to 13.38% and 13.62%, respectively, for the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500 Indices.<br><br></li> <li>For reference, the price only returns for the indices in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows (7/10/24 &ndash; 10/25/24): S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index (7.35%), S&amp;P 500 Index (3.09%), S&amp;P 100 Index (1.89%).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: As noted in our previous post on this topic, smaller companies are often more reliant on outside capital than their larger counterparts, who generally operate in a state of going concern. Given that equity valuations can vary based on the cost of raising said capital (internally or externally), we expect further easing in monetary policy to have an outsized impact on small cap valuations relative to other market capitalizations. Another noteworthy point is that the spread between the federal funds target rate (upper bound) and the CPI remains well-above historical norms. We anticipate small cap valuations could benefit from a narrowing of that spread, over time. That said, there are mounting concerns that the Fed&rsquo;s initial cut may have been too deep. Case-in-point: the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that non-farm payrolls increased by 254,000 in September, well above the consensus expected 150,000. In the U.S., real GDP growth was unrevised at 3.0% in Q2&rsquo;24, but Gross Domestic Income, an alternative measure of economic activity, was revised upward from 1.3% to 3.4%. Given the Fed&rsquo;s data-dependency, a strong U.S. economic outlook may prove to be a headwind to small cap valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The charts cover the quarterly earnings per share (EPS) for 2023 and the first half of 2024, as well as Bloomberg&rsquo;s estimated EPS for the next several quarters. For comparison, we included results and estimates from the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;LargeCap Index&rdquo;), the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index (&ldquo;MidCap Index&rdquo;) and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index (&ldquo;SmallCap Index&rdquo;).</p> <p><strong>As anticipated in our previous post on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/3/26/corporate-earnings-estimates-signal-strength-ahead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here to view</a>), each of the Indices in today&rsquo;s charts saw earnings decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in Q1 and Q2 of 2024. That said, the early year contraction is expected to be short-lived, with year-over-year (y-o-y) comparisons reflecting favorably for each of the three Indices in Q1&rsquo;25.</strong></p> <p>SmallCap Index earnings declined by 9.91% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;24 but are estimated to increase by 3.53% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;25. Earnings for the MidCap Index declined by 5.15% y-o-y in Q4&rsquo;23 but are expected to increase by 0.94% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;25. For comparison, the broader S&amp;P 500 Index is estimated to see earnings increase by 11.09% y-o-y in Q1&rsquo;25.</p> <p><strong>Yearly EPS estimates for each of the Indices for the 2024 and 2025 calendar years and their respective totals are as follows (not in the charts): S&amp;P 500 Index ($241.35 and $274.53); S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index ($175.23 and $201.61); S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index ($81.86 and $96.25).&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Earnings per share for the LargeCap Index are estimated to increase to record-highs in 2024 and 2025 consecutively, while the MidCap Index is expected to see record EPS in 2025. Full-year EPS estimates for the SmallCap Index total $96.25 in 2025, just below its record high of $97.53 set in 2022.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: In our September post on earnings and revenue growth (click here to view it), we voiced our opinion that the recent surge in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be attributed, in part, to expected earnings growth for the companies that comprise the Index. For today&rsquo;s publication, we wanted to provide an alternative look at the data that informs this thought process, as well as an extended view into the mid and small-cap segments of the market. We believe that corporate earnings drive the direction of stock prices over time, especially when the major indices are trading at or near record highs. As the data shows, EPS are expected to trend higher across each of these indices over the next several quarters, with full year estimates reaching record-highs for the LargeCap and MidCap Indices in 2025. As always, these are estimates and are subject to change (and have changed since our last post). That said, we trust today&rsquo;s publication provides a unique perspective on what we view as a major catalyst of the recent surge in equity valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The top three active categories with net inflows over the past 12 months were Taxable Bonds, Nontraditional Equity, and Alternatives, with inflows of $150.45 billion, $20.94 billion, and $15.36 billion, respectively (see table above). For comparison, the top three passive categories were U.S. Equity, Taxable Bond, and International Equity, with inflows of $407.11 billion, $238.26 billion, and $77.21 billion, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Despite compelling total returns in the broader equity markets, equity mutual funds and ETFs saw much lower inflows than their fixed income counterparts over the trailing 12-month period.</strong></p> <p>Combined, the active and passive equity categories experienced inflows of $6.87 billion for the 12-month period ended 9/30/24. For comparison, the Taxable and Municipal Bond categories reported net inflows totaling $416.19 billion over the same time frame. The S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P MidCap 400, and S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Indices posted total returns of 36.33%, 26.76%, and 25.76%, respectively, for the 12-month period ended 9/30/24, according to data from Bloomberg.

In the table above, we observe that the U.S. Equity category experienced the largest disparity, with active shedding $296.95 billion compared to inflows of $407.11 billion for passive funds. Notably, despite compelling total returns in the broader equity markets, equity funds saw net inflows of just $6.87 billion over the trailing 12-month period. For comparison, fixed income saw combined net inflows of $416.19 billion over the same time frame. We think that continued inflows into fixed income investments are reflective of investor&rsquo;s expectations regarding interest rate policy. Morningstar noted that flows into taxable-bond ETFs totaled a record $93 billion during the third quarter and short-term bond funds saw quarterly inflows for the first time since Q3&rsquo;21.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

For today&rsquo;s post (and the previous posts in this series), we set out to determine if that outperformance also exists during periods of high inflation. To construct the table above, we started in 1990 and selected calendar years where inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by 3.0% or more on a trailing 12-month basis. We chose 3.0% as our baseline because the rate of change in the CPI averaged 3.0% from 1926-2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We then selected three defensive sectors (Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities) and compared their total returns to those of the S&amp;P 500 Index over those periods.</p> <ul> <li><strong>While the CPI remains above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target rate of 2.0%, it has fallen below the target level of 3.0% we use for this post. Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index has been the top performer year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&amp;P 500 Index by 7.12 percentage points through 10/15/24.</strong></li> </ul> <p>One reason for Utilities&rsquo; continued outperformance in 2024 is the rise in global usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The International Energy Agency reported that the global electricity consumed by data centers, which typically house the servers that host AI graphics processing units, is forecast to surge from an estimated 460 terra-watt hours in 2022 to more than 1,000 terra-watt hours in 2026. For comparison, this demand is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan. We have posted on this subject recently (<a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/10/3/the-only-constant-is-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a> to view &ldquo;The Only Constant is Change&rdquo;), but it warrants repeating that U.S. data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from just 3% in 2022.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Of the eleven time frames in the table where inflation increased by 3.0% or more on a trailing 12-month basis, there were only two (2021 and 2023) where the S&amp;P 500 Index outperformed each of the Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities sectors.</strong><br><br></li> <li><strong>From 12/29/89 &ndash; 10/15/24 (period captured in the table above), the average annualized total returns posted by the four equity indices presented were as follows (best to worst): 11.66% (S&amp;P 500 Health Care); 10.64% (S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples); 10.61% (S&amp;P 500 Index); and 8.51% (S&amp;P 500 Utilities), according to data from Bloomberg.</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Despite recent disinflation, the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index continues to lead the broader S&amp;P 500 Index by a significant margin YTD. We think improving earnings estimates, surging demand for electricity resulting from increased AI adoption, and recent economic volatility may account for the sector&rsquo;s outperformance. On 10/11/24 data from Bloomberg revealed that earnings for S&amp;P 500 Utilities companies are estimated to increase by 14.6% and 9.1% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. For comparison, those same estimates stood at 8.5% and 7.4%, respectively, on 12/29/23. While forecasts vary for the effect of AI on global electricity consumption, the impact is not likely to be subtle. We think the increase in earnings estimates reflect these expectations. Additionally, recent economic data and geopolitical strife may have prompted investors to utilize defensive sectors as a safe haven. In early October, concerns that the Federal Reserve had cut rates too deeply mounted when non-farm payrolls surpassed all expectations, increasing by 254,000 in September. Notably, the news came on the heels of an August report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics which revised payrolls downward by 818,000 over the 12-month period ended March 2024. From our perspective, investor interest in defensive sectors may remain strong in light of geopolitical strife, economic volatility, and the potential for a resurgence in the pace of rising prices.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Apart from Q3&rsquo;22, Q2&rsquo;23, and Q1&rsquo;24, dividend distributions steadily increased over today&rsquo;s set of observations. In contrast, share buybacks continue to account for a larger share of total capital disbursements despite greater variance.</p> <ul> <li>Combined, stock dividends and share buybacks totaled $1.481 trillion (preliminary data) over the trailing 12-month period ended June 2024, up from $1.389 trillion over the same period last year.</li> <li>Dividend distributions totaled $153.4 billion in Q2&rsquo;24, up from $151.6 billion in Q1&rsquo;24. In total, the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) distributed a record $603.3 billion as dividends over the trailing 12-month period ended in June 2024, up from $576.4 billion over the same period last year.</li> <li>Stock buybacks totaled $235.9 billion in Q2&rsquo;24 (preliminary data), down from $236.8 billion in Q1&rsquo;24. Stock buybacks totaled $877.5 billion over the trailing 12-month period ended June 2024, up from $812.5 billion over the same period last year.</li> <li>In Q2&rsquo;24, the S&amp;P 500 Index sectors that were most aggressive in repurchasing their stock were as follows (% of all stocks repurchased): Information Technology (29.0%); Financials (19.2%); and Communication Services (14.6%), according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Investors often view dividend increases and initiations as signs of financial strength, while cuts and suspensions can be viewed as signs of weakness. Despite a slight contraction in Q1&rsquo;24, the Index&rsquo;s dividend distributions increased to a record $603.3 billion over the trailing 12-months ended June 2024. Year-to-date through 9/30/24, there were eleven dividend cuts and two suspensions in the Index compared to twenty cuts and four suspensions from January through September of last year. Buybacks declined slightly during the quarter, totaling $235.9 billion. When ranked by total buyback expenditures, the top 20 companies in the Index accounted for 52.3% of all share buybacks in Q2&rsquo;24, up from 50.9% in the previous quarter. For comparison, the historical average for the metric is 47.5%.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

To do so we plotted the price returns of the three best and worst performing sectors between 7/9/24 to 10/8/24. We chose 7/9/24 as our starting point because on that day Federal Reserve (&ldquo;Fed&rdquo;) chair Jerome Powell testified to Congress that the U.S. economy was no longer overheated, and that keeping interest rates too high for too long could jeopardize economic growth. On 9/18/24, just over two months later, the Fed voted to reduce its target rate by 50 basis points, setting the rate at 5.00% (upper bound).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>As today&rsquo;s chart reveals, sector performance underwent a seismic shift in the wake of the Fed&rsquo;s comments and subsequent reduction in the policy rate. The total returns for the six sectors in today&rsquo;s chart were as follows (7/9/24 &ndash; 10/8/24):</strong></p> <ul> <li>S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index: 16.37%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Real Estate Index: 13.64%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Industrials Index: 12.37%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index: 6.07%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index: -0.75%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index: -2.03</li> </ul> <p><strong>For comparison, the total returns for these same sectors between 12/29/23 to 7/9/24 were as follows:</strong></p> <ul> <li>S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index: 34.21 %</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Communication Services Index: 30.42%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index: 10.47%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples Index: 9.63%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Industrials Index: 6.82%</li> <li>S&amp;P 500 Real Estate Index: -2.46%</li> </ul> <p><strong>Investor expectations regarding the depth of the Fed&rsquo;s interest rate cuts changed substantially since the end of June.</strong></p> <p>On 6/28/24 the federal funds futures market implied that the federal funds target rate would stand at 4.89% on 12/18/24 (the date of the Fed&rsquo;s final meeting in 2024). As of 10/8/24, that same futures market revealed that investors expect interest rates will decline to 4.33% by the Fed&rsquo;s final meeting of the year and may fall as low as 3.36% by the end of 2025.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: As many investors are aware, the sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) often exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Prior to the Fed&rsquo;s commentary in early July, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology and Communication Services Indices were the top performing sectors in the broader Index in 2024. Notably, those same sectors have been the worst performers in the Index since Powell&rsquo;s speech in July, declining by 2.03% and 0.75%, respectively, between 7/9/24 and 10/8/24. By contrast, Utilities and Real Estate, two of the more interest rate sensitive sectors in the Index, surged by 16.37% and 13.64%, respectively, over the same time frame. From our perspective, this dramatic change in performance can be explained, in part, by increasing expectations (and the eventual reality) of U.S. interest rate cuts. That said, the Fed is admittedly data-dependent when it comes to their policy decisions. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 254,000 in September 2024, well above the projected total of 140,000. Investors will want to keep close watch on U.S. economic data, in our opinion. Should the U.S. economy remain robust, the Fed may decide to adjust the timing of interest rate cuts to avoid reigniting inflation.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Two of the more extreme cases in 2023 were the Communication Services and Technology sectors.

By comparison, those sectors represented 9.2% and 2.6% of the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index, and 11.8% and 2.0% of the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index, respectively, as of the same date.<br><br></li> <li>As of the close on 10/7/24, the trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of the three indices in today&rsquo;s table were as follows: S&amp;P 500 Index P/E: 24.58; S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index P/E: 17.42; S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index P/E: 16.94.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: Both the broader S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P MidCap 400 Indices increased to new all-time highs in September 2024, while the record high for the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index occurred nearly three years ago on 11/8/21.

Today&rsquo;s blog post is one that we update each quarter to lend context to our responses. Sometimes the answer is more evident than at other times, and sometimes it only makes sense via hindsight. While the above chart does not contain yearly data, only two sectors in the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) have been the top-performer in back-to-back calendar years since 2005. Information Technology was the first, posting the highest total return in 2019 (+50.29%) and 2020 (43.89%).

The other eight sectors generated total returns ranging from 10.66% (Financials) to -2.32% (Energy).<br><br></li> <li>By comparison, the total returns of the top performing sectors in Q3 of last year were as follows: Energy (12.22%), Communication Services (3.07%), and Financials (-1.13%). The worst-performing sectors for the period were: Consumer Staples (-5.97%), Real Estate (-8.90%), and Utilities (-9.25%).<br><br></li> <li>Notably, Information Technology and Communication Services, the two top sectors last quarter, were not among the leaders in the most recent quarter. In fact, with total returns of 1.68% and 1.61%, respectively, the Communication Services and Information Technology sectors were among the worst performing sectors over the time frame. Only Energy fared worse, with a total return of -2.32% over the period.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2023/10/3/the-only-constant-is-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here</a> to access the post featuring the top-performing sectors in Q4&rsquo;22, Q1'23, Q2'23 and Q3&rsquo;23.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: As we observe in today&rsquo;s chart, the top-performing sector often varies from quarter to quarter. Of the eleven sectors that make up the Index, the Information Technology and Communication Services Indices boast the highest total returns on a trailing 12-month basis (52.68% and 42.91%, respectively). That said, the Utilities sector increased by 19.37% (total return) in the most recent quarter and is now the top performing sector in the Index year-to-date, with a total return of 30.63% (thru 9/30). The cash flows provided by utility companies are generally very stable, making them compelling investments in times of volatility, in our opinion. The looming U.S. election, growing economic headwinds, and the sharp rise in geopolitical risk may be among the factors driving increased interest in the sector. Surging earnings expectations may be another. Bloomberg reported that by 2034, global energy consumption by data centers is expected to exceed 1,580 terrawatt-hours, or nearly as much power as all of India. In the U.S., data centers are projected to use 8% of total power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs. Earnings estimates increased alongside these demand forecasts. On 12/29/23, the 2024 and 2025 earnings growth rate estimates for the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index were 8.5% and 7.4%, respectively. On 9/27/24, those estimates stood at 14.5% (2024) and 9.1% (2025). Will a different sector rise to the top in the fourth quarter of 2024? We look forward to seeing what the data reveals.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Since precious metals tend to be priced in U.S. dollars, we also included a column that tracks the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major currencies.</p> <ul> <li>Precious metals have historically been considered potential inflation hedges by investors. From 1926-2023, the 12-month rate of change on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) averaged 3.0%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It stood at 2.5% at the end of August 2024, down from its most-recent high of 9.1% set in June 2022.<br><br></li> <li>The price of gold has been trending upward. The spot price of one ounce of gold stood at a record $2,670.40 on 9/26/24. It closed at $2,636.10 on 9/30/24, representing an increase of 27.24% year-to-date (YTD), according to data from Bloomberg.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>The spot price of silver also increased over the same time frame. The spot price of one ounce of silver surged by 30.90% YTD thru 9/30/24. That said, unlike gold, the spot price of silver has not recovered to its all-time high. The price of one ounce of silver stood at $31.15 on 9/30/24, below its all-time high of $49.45 set on 1/18/80.<br><br></li> <li>The spot price of the U.S. Dollar Index declined by 0.55% YTD through 9/30/24.&nbsp;<br><br></li> <li>From 2009 through 2023, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold &amp; Silver Index posted a positive total return in seven of the 15 calendar years. Five of them occurred from 2016 through 2023. It is solidly in positive territory YTD.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Takeaway: In some ways the data presented today may seem counter intuitive. If the CPI is down 6.6 percentage points from its most-recent high, then why are these traditional inflation hedges trending higher? From our perspective, there are several catalysts at play. First, many investors view the U.S. dollar, gold, silver, and other precious metals as safe havens during times of economic turmoil. In last week&rsquo;s post, we noted that weaker than expected employment data may foreshadow softer U.S. economic activity in the coming quarters. Second, geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing war between Russia/Ukraine and continued escalation in the Middle East pose significant risks to near-term growth. Finally, investors may be utilizing these commodities as a haven against a possible resurgence in inflation. This threat has the potential to build over time should the world&rsquo;s central banks continue to embark on more accommodative policies. We expect the recent surge in the valuations of safe haven assets may continue if these risks remain elevated.</strong><br><br><em>The chart and performance data referenced are for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

The decision was highly anticipated and marks the first reduction to the federal funds target rate since March 15, 2020. In today&rsquo;s post, we review the price of the S&amp;P 500 Index (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) during previous rate cut environments and set out to determine what factors may have impacted equity valuations during those time frames. To do so, we charted the price return of the Index alongside the federal funds target rate (upper bound) over the 25-year period ended September 24, 2024.</p> <p><strong>There were three previous cycles where the Fed reduced its policy rate in today&rsquo;s chart (not including the most recent reduction). As the chart reveals, the Index&rsquo;s price declined over each time frame.</strong></p> <p>The Index&rsquo;s total return over the period spanning the first to the last rate cut of each cycle was as follows:&nbsp;</p> <p>Index total return (1/3/01 &ndash; 6/25/03): -24.82%<br>Index total return (9/18/07 &ndash; 12/16/08): -38.16%<br>Index total return (7/31/2019 &ndash; 3/13/20): -7.86%</p> <p>The U.S. economy experienced significant, but unique headwinds throughout each of these reduction cycles. In 2001, the U.S. equity markets, already ailing from the bursting of the dot com bubble, came to a standstill as terrorists attacked on 9/11. In 2007, the &ldquo;Great Recession&rdquo; took root, its genesis found in the collapse of sub-prime mortgages. Then there was the global pandemic, which began in 2019, effectively halting all non-essential economic activity.</p> <p><strong>Notably, earnings for the companies that comprise the Index declined during these three periods.</strong></p> <p>In 2000, actual Index earnings totaled $55.70, according to data from Bloomberg. By 2002, actual earnings had declined to $40.49, and would not increase above $55.70 until 2004. A similar pattern emerged over the next rate cut cycle. Index earnings plummeted from $94.34 in 2007 to $58.25 in 2009. They would not fully recover until 2011. While COVID&rsquo;s impact on the equity markets was short-lived, earnings once again offer a reliable proxy to the Index&rsquo;s return. Actual earnings reported by the companies in the Index totaled $163.57, $142.80, and $198.22 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: We maintain that earnings and revenue growth are fundamental to higher equity valuations (click here to view our recent post on this topic). As of September 20, 2024, Bloomberg&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings growth estimates for the Index stood at 9.34% and 14.34%, respectively. Very healthy, in our opinion. Despite these estimates, economic headwinds have materialized. In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. added 818,000 fewer jobs than originally forecast over the 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024. The news came on the heels of lackluster employment data in July as well. Given that The U.S. derives nearly two-thirds of GDP from consumer spending, an increase in the unemployment rate could threaten economic growth and may be one of the motivations for last week&rsquo;s rate cut. Earnings estimates could be adjusted lower should the economy falter and companies suffer declining revenues. That said, if earnings estimates hold and economic growth continues, we believe equities stand to benefit.</strong></p> <p><em>This table is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that housing starts increased by 9.6% in August 2024, to an annual rate of 1.356 million, compared to the consensus expected annual rate of 1.318 million. New building permits increased as well, rising to an annual rate of 1.475 million (compared to estimates of 1.410 million). That said, the pace of housing starts remains below the levels seen in 2021-2023, according to Brian Wesbury, Chief Economist at First Trust Portfolios, LP.</p> <p><strong>The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Index (Homebuilders Index) increased by 20.36% on a total return basis since the start of the third quarter alone (thru 9/18).&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The surge in the Homebuilders Index occurred despite the continued headwinds to housing starts and building permits we mentioned above. For comparison, the Homebuilders Index increased by 6.27% on a total return basis in the first half of 2024. From our perspective, one catalyst for the increase in valuations has been the increasing likelihood of multiple cuts to the federal funds target rate throughout the remainder of the year.</p> <p><strong>A lower federal funds rate translates to lower mortgage and construction financing rates, which could spur increased investment in housing.</strong></p> <p>As of 9/18/24, the national average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage stood at 6.31% according to Bankrate. This is the lowest the national average has been since February of this year.</p> <p><strong>Housing inventory remains below historical averages.</strong></p> <p>According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, there were only 829,000 vacant housing units for sale in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter. For comparison, there have been 1.395 million vacant homes for sale, on average, on a quarterly basis since the second quarter of 2000. Given current supply constraints as well as the potential for lower interest rates over the near term, we expect demand for the construction of new homes to rise even further.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: The Homebuilders Index has enjoyed a remarkable start to the third quarter, increasing by 20.36% on a total return basis from 6/28 thru 9/18. From our perspective, the Fed&rsquo;s announcement that it was slashing the federal funds target rate by 50 bps, the continued drought in supply, and pent-up demand from potential buyers waiting for lower mortgage rates is likely to lead to further increases in the demand for new homes. In our view, homebuilders could benefit as tailwinds to homebuying continue to develop.</strong></p> <p><em>This table is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Given that consumer spending has historically accounted for roughly two-thirds of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, we think the performance of consumer stocks can offer insight into potential trends in the broader economy.</p> <p><strong>The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Indices increased by 14.07% and 21.92% (total return) over the trailing 12-months ended 9/13.</strong></p> <p>The last time we posted on this topic (click here), consumer staples stocks had lagged consumer discretionary companies by a significant margin over the trailing 12-month period. That is no longer the case. We think the year-to-date (YTD) and 1-year performance margins between the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Indices in the table can be explained, in part, by the increasing possibility of a near term recession. Just after equity markets began digesting July&rsquo;s lackluster manufacturing and employment data, August&rsquo;s report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the U.S. added 818,000 fewer jobs than originally forecast over the 12-month period from April 2023 to March 2024, likely paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its meeting this week.</p> <p><strong>Just how healthy is the U.S. consumer?</strong></p> <p>Real consumer discretionary spending stood at $6.51 trillion YTD thru July, an increase of 3.0% from $6.32 trillion over the same period last year. Consumer sentiment remains strong. Preliminary results from the University of Michigan revealed that consumer sentiment increased by 1.8% year-over-year in September and remains nearly 40% higher than its most recent low set in June 2022. While discretionary spending and consumer sentiment are rising, so is U.S. household debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that aggregate household debt balances increased by $109 billion in Q2&rsquo;24, to $17.80 trillion. Delinquencies are rising. The share of credit card balances that were seriously delinquent (90+ days) stood at 10.9% in Q2&rsquo;24, its highest level since Q1&rsquo;12. As a further pressure, savings rates are dwindling. The U.S. personal savings rate stood at 2.9% in July 2024, down from 4.4% in July 2023.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: Many investors view consumer staples stocks as a refuge during periods of heightened volatility. From our perspective, weaker than expected economic data combined with expanding consumer debt balances, rising delinquency rates, and plummeting personal savings rates may explain the widening performance differential between consumer staples and discretionary stocks presented in today&rsquo;s table. That said, investors would be well-served to keep the full picture in mind. The Federal Reserve reported that U.S. household net worth stood at a record $163.8 trillion at the end of Q2&rsquo;24, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, inflation, as measured by the 12-month rate of change in the consumer price index stood at 2.5% in August, down significantly from its most recent high of 9.1% in June 2022. Disinflation has been a welcome relief to many Americans who, stretched thin by rising interest rates, plummeting savings, and elevated credit card debt, are a significant driver of economic growth. Should the consumer remain healthy, the possibility of the U.S. experiencing a notable recession could be diminished.

On September 9, 2024, the Index closed at 5,471.05, representing an increase of 14.70% on a price-only basis from when it closed at 4,769.83 on December 29, 2023, according to data from Bloomberg. For comparison, from 1928-2023 (96 years) the Index posted an average annual total return of 9.56%. In our post on this topic from October 2023 (click here), we wrote that increased revenues could boost earnings and provide the catalyst for higher equity valuations going forward. We believe that the Index&rsquo;s notable surge over the past months is reflective, in part, of that scenario playing out.</p> <p><strong>Current estimates reveal favorable earnings growth expectations.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>As today&rsquo;s table shows, the earnings for the companies that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index are estimated to increase by a combined 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year (y-o-y) basis in 2024 and 2025. These figures are higher than when they stood at 9.4% and 13.8%, respectively, the last time we posted on this topic (<strong><a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Blogs/MarketBlog/2024/5/21/sp-500-index-earnings--revenue-growth-rate-estimates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></strong>). Keep in mind that estimates for 2024 reflect favorable comparisons to 2023&rsquo;s earnings which declined by 0.9% in 2023 (not in table). In 2024, earnings are estimated to decline in just two of the eleven sectors that comprise the Index (Energy and Materials). The Energy sector&rsquo;s 2024 earnings estimates declined substantially since our last post, falling from -5.4% to -12.6%. From our perspective, the decline in earnings estimates is likely reflective of plummeting oil and gas prices. The price of WTI crude oil stood at $68.71 per barrel on September 9, 2024, down 21.48% on a year-over-year (y-o-y) basis, according to data from Bloomberg. The price of natural gas stood at $2.17 per million BTUs as of the same date, down 16.70% y-o-y.</p> <p><strong>Revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 and 2025 are also favorable.</strong></p> <p>As of September 6, the estimated revenue growth rate for companies in the Index stood at 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025. These figures have increased since our last post (they were 4.5% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2024 and 2025, at that time). Nine of the eleven sectors that comprise the S&amp;P 500 Index reflect positive y-o-y revenue growth rate estimates for 2024 with five of them estimated to surpass 5.0%.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway: We think the recent surge in the S&amp;P 500 Index, which increased by 15.82% on a total return basis year-to-date through September 9, can be explained, in part, by the expected earnings and revenue growth rates revealed in today&rsquo;s table. Additionally, it appears highly likely that the Federal Reserve will initiate multiple cuts to the federal funds rate before the end of this year. A lower discount rate could translate into higher equity valuations. That said, information flows quickly, and these estimates are subject to constant revision. Time will ultimately reveal their accuracy, but we maintain that higher revenues in the coming years could be the best catalyst for growing earnings, and in turn, lead to higher equity valuations.</strong></p> <p><em>This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment.

Over the next several decades, an aging global population will support massive demand for cures and treatments for a variety of diseases, especially those associated with old age. At the same time, innovation is flourishing for biotechnology companies racing to meet these needs, supported by new technologies such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, which enables researchers to analyze massive amounts of data more efficiently, or cloud-based infrastructure, which provides virtually unlimited computing power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over much of the past few years, biotechnology stocks have struggled with a hangover from COVID-19, higher costs of capital, and political pressure related to drug pricing.

Since June 30, 2024, FBT has posted an 11.1% total return, compared to a 6.8% gain for the Nasdaq Biotechnology&trade; Index and a 2.7% gain for the S&amp;P 500&reg; Index (as of 8/20/24). We discuss a few potential catalysts that may continue to benefit biotechnology stocks in the months ahead, in our opinion, including falling interest rates, increased mergers and acquisitions (&ldquo;M&amp;A&rdquo;) activity, and rising demand for defensive sectors if the economy slows.</p> <p>To continue reading, <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/Insights/2024/8/22/a-potential-cure-for-economic-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p> Thu, 22 Aug 2024 19:45:26 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/22/a-potential-cure-for-economic-uncertainty Bob Stein - Updated Odds and Scenarios for a Reset Presidential Race https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race <a href='/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race'><img border='0' alt='Click here to link to video post' src='/common/images/play_button.png'></a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p>Bob Stein joins the podcast to discusses how the nomination of Kamala Harris will impact the upcoming presidential election, his thoughts on each candidate&rsquo;s choice of running mate, and how elections results may impact the economy in the years ahead.</p> Mon, 12 Aug 2024 19:22:55 GMT First Trust Advisors First Trust Advisors https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race Market Minute - August 2024 https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/market-minute---august-2024 <p>The presidential race for the White House has already had tremendous drama and we are still 96 days from Election Day!

While small- and mid-capitalization (&ldquo;cap&rdquo;) U.S. industrial stocks have performed relatively well recently, we view U.S. reindustrialization as a largely untapped secular growth opportunity that may continue to flourish over the next decade. Below, we unpack several key drivers for the return of American manufacturing, followed by a brief discussion of why we believe the First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance&reg; ETF (AIRR) is well-positioned to benefit.</p> <p>To continue reading, <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/Insights/2024/10/14/investing-in-the-return-of-american-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 13:48:04 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/10/14/investing-in-the-return-of-american-industry</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>ETF Data Watch: Asset Flows Monitor October 2024 Edition</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/10/7/etf-data-watch-asset-flows-monitor-october-2024-edition</link>\n\n<description><img src='https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=c50929e6-0114-4741-badc-1bfcc14643d2' border='0'><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><ul> <li>Net inflows for US-listed ETFs totaled $87.3 billion in September, bringing total ETF assets under management to $9.83 trillion.<br><br></li> <li>Equity ETFs had net inflows totaling $52.7 billion in September, bringing trailing 12-months (TTM) net inflows to $637.2 billion.

Over the next several decades, an aging global population will support massive demand for cures and treatments for a variety of diseases, especially those associated with old age. At the same time, innovation is flourishing for biotechnology companies racing to meet these needs, supported by new technologies such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, which enables researchers to analyze massive amounts of data more efficiently, or cloud-based infrastructure, which provides virtually unlimited computing power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over much of the past few years, biotechnology stocks have struggled with a hangover from COVID-19, higher costs of capital, and political pressure related to drug pricing. For the three-year period ending on June 30, 2024, the <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FBT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>First Trust NYSE&reg; Arca&reg; Biotechnology Index Fund (FBT)</strong></a> produced a cumulative loss of 10.9%, compared to a 33.1% gain for the S&amp;P 500&reg; Index. However, over the past several weeks, momentum has begun to shift in favor of the biotechnology industry. Since June 30, 2024, FBT has posted an 11.1% total return, compared to a 6.8% gain for the Nasdaq Biotechnology&trade; Index and a 2.7% gain for the S&amp;P 500&reg; Index (as of 8/20/24). We discuss a few potential catalysts that may continue to benefit biotechnology stocks in the months ahead, in our opinion, including falling interest rates, increased mergers and acquisitions (&ldquo;M&amp;A&rdquo;) activity, and rising demand for defensive sectors if the economy slows.</p> <p>To continue reading, <a href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/Commentary/Insights/2024/8/22/a-potential-cure-for-economic-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 19:45:26 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/22/a-potential-cure-for-economic-uncertainty</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Bob Stein - Updated Odds and Scenarios for a Reset Presidential Race</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race</link>\n\n<description><a href='/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race'><img border='0' alt='Click here to link to video post' src='/common/images/play_button.png'></a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p>Bob Stein joins the podcast to discusses how the nomination of Kamala Harris will impact the upcoming presidential election, his thoughts on each candidate&rsquo;s choice of running mate, and how elections results may impact the economy in the years ahead.</p></description>\n\n<pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 19:22:55 GMT</pubDate>\n\n<category>First Trust Advisors</category>\n\n<dc:creator>First Trust Advisors</dc:creator>\n\n<guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/bob-steinupdated-odds-and-scenarios-for-a-reset-presidential-race</guid>\n\n...\n\n</item>\n\n<item>\n\n<title>Market Minute - August 2024</title>\n\n<link>https://www.ftportfolios.com/blogs/InvestBlog/2024/8/12/market-minute---august-2024</link>\n\n<description><p>The presidential race for the White House has already had tremendous drama and we are still 96 days from Election Day! Who knows what may transpire next? Many investors attempt to tactically &ldquo;play&rdquo; the expected result of the presidential election prior to the actual vote.&nbsp;</p> <p>In our view, positioning portfolios based on a candidate&rsquo;s policy views and an expectation of that candidate&rsquo;s victory are misguided.

While growing electricity demand from electric vehicles (&ldquo;EVs&rdquo;) has emerged over the past several years, the scale of potential demand from other new innovations, especially artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and cryptocurrency, is often overlooked.
