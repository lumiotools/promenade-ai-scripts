The paper, titled [“Nemvaleukin alfa as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors: the phase 1/2, non-randomized ARTISTRY-1 trial,”](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GC3U7sXr0MLUJ55h1W_XefgFjOeokWvmfkmrA0FPder_3K_FtSXjU829iyL8wP9f40rxnzElv1eD-dtEBJNYVAT0UPZ0ueAEyHfXmf19hRdd90aEzQBs_9DWoyYFthnVPPQzouUrrcqKcqyN4uQFjzc9AxMzCCG5H3r6z5MfppF7EnW89LLFSSmGkmPVhCE4ELWW3wofQxWbluWIBRujlKZBkttf0Li0uZ8VurC_K0UocJWQkDtLMn091xFfF_HLKUt5cioP9UyQegEcpJqVD9UqavsT_BuvRbBTx-eopzU=) was published in the _Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer_(JITC).\n\n“While immunotherapies have marked a paradigm shift in the treatment of some types of cancers, many patients still face challenges, including lack of response, tolerability issues, or resistance to therapy, and there remains a great deal of unmet clinical need. In the ARTISTRY-1 study, notable antitumor activity of nemvaleukin was observed in both monotherapy and combination therapy. What was most striking were the durable and complete responses in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which does not usually respond to immunotherapy. These clinical data provide a solid foundation for Mural’s ongoing late-stage trials,” said Ulka Vaishampayan, MD, Professor, Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Michigan and the paper’s lead author.\n\nNemvaleukin is a novel, engineered fusion protein designed to leverage the antitumor effects of the IL-2 pathway while mitigating aldesleukin’s toxicity. ARTISTRY-1 was a three-part, open-label, phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of both nemvaleukin monotherapy and combination therapy with pembrolizumab. The study was conducted at 32 sites in seven countries, with 286 patients with advanced solid tumors enrolled and treated from July 2016 to March 2023.\n\nARTISTRY-1 is the foundation of Mural’s two ongoing potentially registrational trials, with data readouts expected in late Q1/early Q2 2025 for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) and Q2 2025 for mucosal melanoma.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\nAs previously reported, nemvaleukin was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising antitumor activity alone and in combination with pembrolizumab across heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors. Robust expansion of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with minimal expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cells were observed following treatment, thus supporting the design hypothesis of nemvaleukin.\n\n**Monotherapy:**\n\n  * **10% overall response rate (ORR) with nemvaleukin monotherapy** (7/68; 95% CI 4 to 20), with all seven confirmed partial responses (melanoma, n=4; renal cell carcinoma, n=3).\n  * **33.3% ORR in patients with mucosal melanoma** , with two partial responses (one confirmed, one unconfirmed) in six evaluable patients. All responders had been on prior CPI therapy and progressed.\n\n\n\n**Combination therapy:**\n\n  * **13% ORR** **with nemvaleukin and pembrolizumab** (19/144; 95% CI 8 to 20), with five confirmed complete responses and 14 confirmed partial responses. Six responses were in PD-(L)1 inhibitor-approved and five in PD-(L)1 inhibitor-unapproved tumor types.\n  * **21% ORR in patients with PROC:** Notably, there were three confirmed responses (two complete, one partial) in 14 evaluable patients with PROC, which does not normally respond to immunotherapy and for which there are no approved immunotherapies. Additionally, there was one unconfirmed partial response.\n  * **Durable, stable disease for greater than 6 months** was observed in patients with cervical cancer, bladder cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, PROC, and endometrial cancer.\n\n\n\n**Safety and Tolerability:**\n\n  * Nemvaleukin was administered in an outpatient setting throughout treatment and had a manageable safety profile, with a low rate (4%) of discontinuation due to adverse events.\n  * Most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TREAs) were neutropenia and anemia.\n\n\n\n**About Mural Oncology**\n\nMural Oncology is leveraging its novel protein engineering platform to develop cytokine-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Nemvaleukin selectively binds to the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and is sterically occluded from binding to the high-affinity IL-2R. Because of this molecular design, nemvaleukin treatment leads to preferential expansion of antitumor CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, with minimal expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Nemvaleukin is currently being evaluated in two potentially registrational late-stage trials.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With our deep expertise of protein engineering and cancer biology, we are working to address key limitations with cytokine therapies and unleash their full potential. We are now focused on clinical execution, with major readouts of our two potentially registrational studies of nemvaleukin in the first half of next year, and commercial readiness. We are also deepening our pipeline with candidate nominations for our IL-18 and IL-12 programs expected by the end of this year,” said Caroline Loew, Ph.D., CEO of Mural Oncology.\n\n**Clinical Progress & Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\nMural’s late-stage trials of nemvaleukin alfa (nemvaleukin), an engineered fusion protein designed to leverage Interleukin-2’s (IL-2) antitumor effects while mitigating its hallmark toxicities, remain on track. The company shared new information related to study design, statistical assumptions, and study execution at a virtual Investor Day in September 2024, including:\n\n  * Completion of enrollment in **ARTISTRY-7** , the company’s potentially registrational phase 3 trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), with a total of 456 patients enrolled. The study is comparing the combination of nemvaleukin and pembrolizumab versus investigator’s choice single agent chemotherapy. Mural expects to report interim overall survival (OS) results in late Q1 or early Q2 based on an analysis performed at approximately 75% of OS events. If the hazard ratio meets the bar for success (0.727, or a 27.3% reduction in the risk of death assuming exactly 215 OS events), the company plans to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2025 subject to discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company expects to report final results in the second quarter of 2026.\n  * Completion of enrollment in **ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 2,** the company’s potentially registrational phase 2 study of single agent nemvaleukin in patients with unresectable or metastatic mucosal melanoma, with 92 patients enrolled. Mural anticipates reporting top-line results from cohort 2 of ARTISTRY-6 in Q2 of 2025. The target response rate is 25%. Mural believes that in this rare and highly aggressive tumor with poor outcomes even in the first line setting, demonstrating durable responses with a response rate of 20-25% would be meaningful for patients, and would support a discussion with the FDA regarding a BLA submission and potential accelerated approval.\n\n\n\nFor the full updates from Mural’s Investor Day, please visit [the webcast](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AJWPXp4GWyOMIYMZE15wxDzhVADzQ6nGUmMlzGromZUwX9MswaYw0AXq8fjYlz9gSVXz_-N9u872wXxrOfy32mnEslIV_EooR2W8_FD2x24js95Q-azmlpDslPNKdn1nImLZoVAK7ByTf-dRRtwpxQ==) on our [Events & Presentations page](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ec_PqFEHIPnyg7a1JKyhQCVZ4qOfoMAFt3VImoxGYfwjlOFkIAm3EorH-YZNh4Cw-CNI4Ffx7s6jIw90gLuRjFelBdZhY6-YcxWjjCk468nM33hihq6-4oCQNLpwn6hjcRJoUS5_2bXDFuf06yRXtA==).\n\nMural is also evaluating a less-frequent intravenous (LFIV) dose of nemvaleukin in patients with cutaneous melanoma in **ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 3** (monotherapy) **and Cohort 4** (combination with pembrolizumab). The company continues to expect preliminary data readouts in the monotherapy cohort in the first half of 2025, and in the combination cohort in the second half of 2025.\n\n**Preclinical Program Updates:**\n\nMural plans to nominate development candidates for its IL-18 and IL-12 programs by the end of 2024. The company expects to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for its IL-18 program to the FDA in Q4 2025.\n\n**Other Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\nIn September, Mural announced the appointment of Sachiyo Minegishi to its board of directors and chair of the Audit Committee. Ms. Minegishi brings over two decades of biopharma experience, with a focus on corporate strategy, finance, development, and commercialization. She is currently the Chief Operating Officer at Rectify Pharmaceuticals, driving corporate and financing strategy to advance its lead program from discovery to clinical stage. Prior to Rectify, she was Chief Financial Officer at Akouos, Inc., where she led corporate finance and business development strategy and played a key role in the acquisition of the company by Eli Lilly.\n\nIn October, Mural continued to prepare for potential launch readiness by creating a new commercial division in the company. Brandon Kotaniemi, SVP of Commercial, will drive Mural’s commercial strategy as the company prepares for the potential BLA submission and launch of nemvaleukin. He will also partner closely with Mural’s development team as the company looks to move its IL-18 program into the clinic.\n\nIn November, Mural presented clinical and preclinical data at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). The three poster presentations included tumor microenvironment pharmacodynamic data from the phase 1/2 ARTISTRY-3 study of nemvaleukin as well as data from Mural’s two preclinical research programs in IL-18 and IL-12.\n\n**Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $175.5 million.\n\n**R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses were $27.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $40.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to different team composition compared to the personnel previously allocated to us by Alkermes plc (Alkermes), our former parent prior to the separation, as well as decreased spend on the ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials as activities related to these trials wound down in 2023, and decreased spend on the ARTISTRY-7 trial due to the timing of patient enrollment.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative expenses were $6.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $6.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to costs associated with operating as a standalone company after the separation. This includes professional fees as well as differences in costs of insurance and taxes compared to amounts previously allocated to us by Alkermes prior to the separation.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $31.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $51.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Financial Guidance:** The company reaffirms guidance that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 are expected to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nAs noted previously, management forecasts lower operating expenses in 2025 versus 2024 due to the timing of clinical trial expenses.\n\n**About Mural Oncology**\n\nMural Oncology is leveraging its novel protein engineering platform to develop cytokine-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Nemvaleukin selectively binds to the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and is sterically occluded from binding to the high-affinity IL-2R. Because of this molecular design, nemvaleukin treatment leads to preferential expansion of antitumor CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, with minimal expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Nemvaleukin is currently being evaluated in two potentially registrational late-stage trials.\n\n**About Mural Oncology’s IL-18 Program**\n\nIL-18 is a potent immune-stimulating cytokine, but its efficacy is blunted by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a high affinity decoy receptor that binds to, and neutralizes, IL-18, thereby rendering it ineffective. Native IL-18’s potency is also limited by its short half-life. Mural Oncology’s novel approach to protein engineering is designed to mitigate these issues. First, Mural introduced mutations to IL-18 that eliminate binding to IL-18BP while minimally impacting the native IL-18 structure. Second, it fused IL-18 to protein scaffolds which extend the half-life and increase IL-18’s exposure. Together, these have demonstrated more durable immunological effect in preclinical studies. Mural intends to nominate a development candidate for its IL-18 program by the end of this year and file an IND submission in Q4 2025.\n\n**About Mural Oncology’s IL-12 Program**\n\nNative IL-12 is a highly potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, but because of its very narrow therapeutic index, it can also be toxic with systemic exposure. To mitigate this hallmark toxicity, Mural, through its novel approach to protein engineering, split the IL-12p70 heterodimer into two inactive monomers: IL12p35 and IL-12p40. These individual subunits are then separately fused to antibody fragments and sequentially injected, which deliver and concentrate IL-12 specifically in the tumor microenvironment to limit systemic exposure. In preclinical studies, Mural’s engineered IL-12 achieved the desired reduction in serum while maintaining tumor concentrations providing the potential to reduce systemic toxicities. Mural intends to nominate a development candidate for its IL-12 program by the end of this year.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
