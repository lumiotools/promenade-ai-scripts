CTBI is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers for their source of deposits. As of September 30, 2024, no one customer accounted for more than 3% of our $5.1 billion in deposits. Only two customer relationships accounted for more than 1% each. \n\nShareholders’ equity at $760.8 million increased $41.4 million, or an annualized 22.9%, during the quarter and $107.7 million, or 16.5%, from September 30, 2023. Net unrealized losses on securities, net of deferred taxes, were $80.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $107.1 million at June 30, 2024 and $141.4 million at September 30, 2023.

Accruing loans 30-89 days past due at $20.6 million decreased $3.5 million from prior quarter but increased $8.5 million from September 30, 2023. Our loan portfolio management processes focus on the immediate identification, management, and resolution of problem loans to maximize recovery and minimize loss. \n\nWe had net loan charge-offs of $1.5 million, or an annualized 0.14% of average loans, for the third quarter 2024 compared to $1.4 million, or an annualized 0.13% of average loans, for the second quarter 2024 and $1.2 million, or an annualized 0.12% of average loans, for the third quarter 2023. Of the net charge-offs for the quarter, $1.2 million were in indirect consumer loans, $0.2 million were in direct consumer loans, and $0.1 million were in residential loans. Year-to-date net loan charge-offs of an annualized 0.14% of average loans are in line with management’s expectations. \n\n**Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nOur provision for credit losses at $2.7 million for the quarter decreased $0.2 million from prior quarter but increased $0.9 million from prior year same quarter. Of the provision for the quarter, $1.1 million was allotted to fund loan growth. Year-to-date provision for credit losses increased $3.4 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Accounting Policies\nIn the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (which consist of normal recurring\nadjustments) necessary, to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of operations, other comprehensive\nincome (loss), and the changes in shareholders’ equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the cash flows for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for\ninterim financial information, these statements do not include certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete annual financial\nstatements. The results of operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and the changes in shareholders’ equity for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial\nstatements of Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. (“CTBI”) for that period. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes\nthereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our annual report on Form 10-K.\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CTBI and its separate and distinct,\nwholly owned subsidiaries Community Trust Bank, Inc. (“CTB”) and Community Trust and Investment Company. All significant intercompany transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\nNew Accounting Standards –\n➢ Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting – In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,\nwhich extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. The amendments in ASU No. 2022-06 are effective for all\nentities upon issuance. In 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform\non Financial Reporting, which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on\nfinancial reporting. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide relief during the temporary transition period, so the FASB included a sunset\nprovision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) would cease being published. The amendments in\nASU No. 2020-04 provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate\nreform on financial reporting and provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions\naffected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This ASU applies only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another\nreference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract\nmodifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. In 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority delayed the\nintended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June 30, 2023. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant\nnumber of modifications may take place, ASU No. 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which\nentities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\n7\nOn January 27, 2023, CTBI received notice from the trustee of the trust subsidiary, that based on their review of the junior subordinated debentures\nand the related trust preferred securities (the “TRUPS Documents”), after application of the LIBOR Act (as implemented by the Final Regulations (defined\nbelow), the “LIBOR Act”) and the final regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued on December 16, 2022 implementing the\nLIBOR Act (the “Final Regulations”), the TRUPS Documents issued by the trust subsidiary do not provide a replacement rate for Applicable LIBOR (a\n“Replacement Rate”) or include other fallback provisions which would apply on the first London banking day after June 30, 2023 (the “LIBOR Replacement\nDate”). Absent an amendment to the TRUPS Documents, some other change in applicable law, rule, regulation, or some other development, the LIBOR Act as\nimplemented by the Final Regulations provides that (i) on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date, 3-month CME Term SOFR or 6-month CME Term SOFR\n(as defined in the Final Regulations) as adjusted by the relevant spread adjustment, which is 0.26161 percent or 0.42826 percent, shall be the benchmark\nreplacement for the Applicable LIBOR in the TRUPS Documents and (ii) all applicable benchmark replacement conforming changes (as specified in the Final\nRegulations) will become an integral part of the TRUPS Documents, without any action by any party.\n➢ Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions – In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03,\nFair Value Measurement Topic 820: Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The FASB issued this ASU to (1)\nclarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit\nthe sale of an equity security, (2) amend a related illustrative example, and (3) introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual\nsale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of\nan equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments\nalso clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this ASU also require\nthe following disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions: (1) the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions\nreflected in the balance sheet; (2) the nature and remaining duration of the restriction(s); and (3) the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s).\nFor public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those\nfiscal years. The adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements.\n➢ FASB Improves the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures – The FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments—Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method, which is intended to\nimprove the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures. This ASU is a consensus of the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”).\nThis ASU allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the\nprogram giving rise to the related income tax credits. This ASU responds to stakeholder feedback that the proportional amortization method provides investors\nand other allocators of capital with a better understanding of the returns from investments that are made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits. Reporting entities were previously permitted to apply the proportional amortization method only to qualifying tax equity\ninvestments in low-income housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) structures. In recent years, stakeholders asked the FASB to extend the application of the proportional\namortization method to qualifying tax equity investments that generate tax credits through other programs, which resulted in the EITF addressing this issue.\nFor public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal\nyears.\n8\nAs a result of the implementation of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative effect impact that reduced retained earnings by $2.0 million during the first\nquarter 2024. Additionally, we had a decrease in amortization expense, recognized in other direct expenses, that totaled $0.7 million for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The amortization expense included in income tax expense was $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.4\nmillion year-to-date. The amount of income tax credits and other tax benefits recognized was $1.1 million during the third quarter 2024 and $3.2 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. The amortization, income tax credits, and other tax benefits recognized were included in income tax expense on the\nstatement of income and in net income on the statement of cash flows. We had $16.8 million in tax investments at September 30, 2024 included in other assets\non the balance sheet. There were no non-income tax related activities or other returns received that were recognized outside of income tax expense and the\nstatement of income and the statement of cash flows. There were also no significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of the\ninvestment or change in the relationship with the underlying projects. No investment income or loss was included in pre-tax income, and no impairment was\nrecognized during the quarter or year to date resulting from the forfeiture or ineligibility of income tax credits or other circumstances. At September 30, 2024,\nthere was $5.0 million in unfunded commitments. Of the amount outstanding, the contribution schedule is as follows:\n(in thousands) Unfunded\nAmount due in: Commitments\n2024 $ 1,835\n2025 2,000\n2026 315\n2027 146\n2028 146\nAfter 508\n➢ FASB Issues Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures – In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 provide for new disclosures which: (1) require that a public\nentity disclose on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and\nincluded within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (2) require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other\nsegment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition; (3) require that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods; (4) allows more than one measure of segment profit or loss used by the\nCODM when assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to be disclosed; (5) require disclosure of title and position of CODM and\nexplain how the CODM uses the disclosed reported measures to assess segment performance; and (6) require that a public entity that has a single reportable\nsegment provide all the disclosures required by the amended Topic 280. The amendments in this update are effective for CTBI for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update\nare required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and\namounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories and the amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be\nbased on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. CTBI’s financial condition, results of operations, and\ncash flows will not be impacted by this guidance; however, CTBI will begin to provide disclosures of a single reportable segment at the respective\nimplementation dates.\n➢ FASB Issues Standard that Enhance Income Tax Disclosures – In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which addresses requests for improved income tax disclosures from investors, lenders, creditors, and other\nallocators of capital that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. The new update is effective for public business entities for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for\nissuance. The ASU is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of\ninformation in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments intended to improve\nthe effectiveness of income tax disclosures. CTBI does not intend to early adopt. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n9\nSignificant Accounting Policies –\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies,\nmany of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements\nand related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such\ndifferences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are\nconstantly reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found our application of accounting\npolicies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates.\nWe have identified the following significant accounting policies:\nInvestments – Management determines the classification of securities at purchase. We classify debt securities into held-to-maturity, trading, or\navailable-for-sale categories. Held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities are those which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported\nat amortized cost. In accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt Securities, investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity shall be classified in one of the following categories and measured at fair value in the statement of financial position:\na. Trading securities. Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term (thus held for only a short\nperiod of time) shall be classified as trading securities. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling, and trading securities are\ngenerally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price.\nb. Available-for-sale securities. Investments not classified as trading securities (nor as HTM securities) shall be classified as available-for-sale\n(“AFS”) securities.\nWe do not have any securities that are classified as trading securities. AFS securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses\nincluded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. If declines in fair value are other than temporary, the carrying value of the securities is\nwritten down to fair value as a realized loss with a charge to income for the portion attributable to credit losses and a charge to other comprehensive income for\nthe portion that is not credit related.\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we evaluate the securities to determine whether the decline in the fair value below the\namortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related factors or non-credit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for AFS debt\nsecurities on the consolidated balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to\nearnings. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL for AFS debt securities and the\nadjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if we intend to sell an impaired AFS debt security or more likely than not will be\nrequired to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding\nadjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL for AFS debt securities\nin this situation.\n10\nIn evaluating AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such securities,\nwe consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether\ndowngrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, among other factors. There were no credit\nrelated factors underlying unrealized losses on AFS debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, therefore, no ACL for AFS securities was\nrecorded.\nChanges in the ACL for AFS debt securities are recorded as expense. Losses are charged against the ACL for AFS debt securities when management\nbelieves the uncollectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nGains or losses on disposition of debt securities are computed by specific identification for those securities. Interest and dividend income, adjusted by\namortization of purchase premium or discount, is included in earnings.\nHTM securities are subject to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses, determined by adjusting historical loss information for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The forward-looking evaluation of lifetime expected losses will be performed on a pooled basis for debt\nsecurities that share similar risk characteristics. These allowances for expected losses must be made by the holder of the HTM debt security when the security\nis purchased. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, CTBI held no securities designated as HTM.\nCTBI accounts for equity securities in accordance with ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities. ASC 321 requires equity investments (except those\naccounted for under the equity method and those that result in the consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair values\nrecognized in net income.\nEquity securities with a readily determinable fair value are required to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nEquity securities without a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost, less any impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable\nprice changes for identical or similar investments. As permitted by ASC 321-10-35-2, CTBI can make an irrevocable election to subsequently measure an\nequity security without a readily determinable fair value, and all identical or similar investments of the same issuer, including future purchases of identical or\nsimilar investments of the same issuer, at fair value. CTBI has made this election for our Visa Class B equity securities. The fair value of these securities was\ndetermined by a third party service provider using Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, and changes in fair value are recognized in\nincome.\nLoans – Loans with the ability and the intent to be held until maturity and/or payoff are reported at the carrying value of unpaid principal reduced by\nunearned interest, an ACL, and unamortized deferred fees or costs and premiums. Income is recorded on the level yield basis. Interest accrual is discontinued\nwhen management believes, after considering economic and business conditions, collateral value, and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition\nis such that collection of interest is doubtful. Any loan greater than 90 days past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing\ninterest. Cash payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied against principal, and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is\nreasonably assured. Loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments remain current for a period of time, generally six months, and\nfuture payments appear reasonably certain. Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount\namortized over the estimated life of the related loans, or commitments as a yield adjustment.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – CTBI accounts for the ACL under ASC 326. CTBI measures expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective\n(pool) basis using the discounted cash flow method when the financial assets share similar risk characteristics. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are\nevaluated on an individual basis. Regardless of an initial measurement method, once it is determined that foreclosure is probable, the ACL is measured based\non the fair value of the collateral as of the measurement date. As a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral may be used for a loan when determining\nthe ACL for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The fair value shall be adjusted for selling costs when foreclosure is probable. For collateral-dependent financial assets, the credit loss\nexpected may be zero if the fair value less costs to sell exceed the amortized cost of the loan. Loans shall not be included in both collective assessments and\nindividual assessments.\n11\nIn the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, CTBI has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, CTBI\nelected ASU 2019-04 which allows that accrued interest would continue to be presented separately and not part of the amortized cost of the loan. The\nmethodology used by CTBI is developed using the current loan balance, which is then compared to amortized cost balances to analyze the impact. The\ndifference in amortized cost basis versus consideration of loan balances impacts the ACL calculation by one basis point and is considered immaterial.\nWe maintain an ACL at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans, as well as estimated credit losses\ninherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ACL.\nWe utilize an internal risk grading system for commercial credits. Those credits that meet the following criteria are subject to individual evaluation:\nthe loan has an outstanding bank share balance of $1 million or greater and meets one of the following criteria: (i) has a criticized risk rating, (ii) is in\nnonaccrual status, (iii) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty with significant payment delay, or (iv) is 90 days or more past due. The borrower’s\ncash flow, adequacy of collateral coverage, and other options available to CTBI, including legal remedies, are evaluated. We evaluate the collectability of both\nprincipal and interest when assessing the need for loss provision. Historical loss rates are analyzed and applied to other commercial loan segments not subject\nto individual evaluation.\nHomogenous loans, such as consumer installment, residential mortgages, and home equity lines are not individually risk graded. The associated ACL\nfor these loans is measured in pools with similar risk characteristics under ASC 326.\nWhen any secured commercial loan is considered uncollectable, whether past due or not, a current assessment of the value of the underlying collateral\nis made. If the balance of the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral, the loan is placed on nonaccrual and the loan is charged down to the value of the\ncollateral less estimated cost to sell. For commercial loans greater than $1 million that are categorized as individually evaluated based on the criteria listed\nabove, a specific reserve is established if a loss is determined to be possible and then charged-off once it is probable. When the foreclosed collateral has been\nlegally assigned to CTBI, the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is then transferred to other real estate owned or other repossessed assets, and\na charge-off is taken for any remaining balance. When any unsecured commercial loan is considered uncollectable the loan is charged off no later than at 90\ndays past due.\nAll closed-end consumer loans (excluding conventional 1-4 family residential loans and installment and revolving loans secured by real estate) are\ncharged off no later than 120 days (five monthly payments) delinquent. If a loan is considered uncollectable, it is charged off earlier than 120 days delinquent.\nFor conventional 1-4 family residential loans and installment and revolving loans secured by real estate, when a loan is 90 days past due, a current assessment\nof the value of the real estate is made. If the balance of the loan exceeds the fair value of the property, the loan is placed on nonaccrual. Foreclosure\nproceedings are normally initiated after 120 days. When the foreclosed property has been legally assigned to CTBI, the fair value less estimated costs to sell is\ntransferred to other real estate owned and the remaining balance is taken as a charge-off.\nCTBI utilizes third party software and discounted cash flow loss rate methodologies for all loan segments. Within the discount cash flow calculation,\nan effective yield of the instrument is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument expected cash flows. The expected cash\nflows were modeled considering probability of default and segment-specific loss given default (“LGD”) risk factors, utilizing the software’s proprietary\ndatabase of financial institutions’ filings, evaluated first by geography and asset size and then with the utilization of standard deviations, to assure relevance to\nCTBI’s loan segments along with CTBI’s own loss history. Cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present\nvalue (“NPV”) of expected cash flows. An ACL is established for the difference between the instrument’s NPV and amortized cost basis. Any changes in NPV\nbetween periods is recorded as provision for credit losses. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on\nhistorical internal data and adjusted, if necessary, based on the reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions. Management incorporates\nqualitative factors to loss estimates used to derive CTBI’s total ACL including delinquency trends, current economic conditions and trends, strength of\nsupervision and administration of the loan portfolio, levels of underperforming loans, underwriting exceptions, and industry concentrations. Forecast factors\ninclude gross domestic product, retail and food service sales, and S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. Management continually reevaluates the\nother subjective factors included in our ACL analysis.\n12\nGoodwill and Core Deposit Intangible – We evaluate total goodwill and core deposit intangible for impairment, based upon ASC 350, Intangibles-\nGoodwill and Other, using fair value techniques including multiples of price/equity. Goodwill and core deposit intangible are evaluated for impairment on an\nannual basis or as other events may warrant.\nThe balance of goodwill, at $65.5 million, has not changed since January 1, 2015.\nIncome Taxes – Income tax expense is based on the taxes due on the consolidated tax return plus deferred taxes based on the expected future tax\nbenefits and consequences of temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates. Any interest and\npenalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, CTBI has not recognized a significant amount of interest expense or penalties in connection with income\ntaxes.\nEstimated Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures Recognized as Other Liabilities – CTBI estimates expected credit losses over\nthe contractual period in which it has exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable\nby CTBI. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures recognized in other liabilities, is adjusted as an expense in other non-interest expense. The estimate\nincludes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their\nestimated lives. Estimating credit losses on unfunded commitments requires CTBI to consider the following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposure:\nunfunded commitments to extend credit, unfunded lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Each of these unfunded commitments is then analyzed for a\nprobability of funding to calculate a probable funding amount. The life of loan loss factor by related portfolio segment from the loan ACL calculation is then\napplied to the probable funding amount to calculate the estimated credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures recognized as other liabilities.\nNote 2 – Stock-Based Compensation\nRestricted stock expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $293 thousand and $364 thousand, respectively, including $41\nthousand and $45 thousand, respectively, in dividends paid for those periods. Restricted stock expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, including $121 thousand and $133 thousand, respectively, in dividends paid for those periods. As of September\n30, 2024, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock grants that will be recognized as expense as the\nawards vest over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. There were no shares of restricted stock granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. There were 15,000 and 52,865 shares of restricted stock granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nrestricted stock was issued pursuant to the terms of CTBI’s 2015 Stock Ownership Incentive Plan. The restrictions on the restricted stock will lapse ratably over\nfour years, subject to such employee’s continued employment. However, in the event of certain participant employee termination events occurring within 24\nmonths of a change in control of CTBI or the death of the participant, the restrictions will lapse, and in the event of the participant’s disability, the restrictions\nwill lapse on a pro rata basis. The Compensation Committee will have discretion to review and revise restrictions applicable to a participant’s restricted stock in\nthe event of the participant’s retirement. There were no shares forfeited during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were 2,437 and\n790 shares of restricted stock forfeited during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n13\nThere was no compensation expense related to stock option grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30,\n2024, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards, as all stock option awards have fully vested. There were no\nstock options granted in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023.\nNote 3 – Securities\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:\nAvailable-for-Sale\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 361,391 $ 106 $ (17,297) $ 344,200\nState and political subdivisions 306,163 124 (40,416) 265,871\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities 488,382 283 (49,916) 438,749\nAsset-backed securities 49,353 11 (108) 49,256\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 1,205,289 $ 524 $ (107,737) $ 1,098,076\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:\nAvailable-for-Sale\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 381,268 $ 121 $ (26,572) $ 354,817\nState and political subdivisions 313,147 88 (48,290) 264,945\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities 518,836 36 (62,136) 456,736\nAsset-backed securities 87,993 0 (767) 87,226\nTotal available-for-sale securities $ 1,301,244 $ 245 $ (137,765) $ 1,163,724\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity are shown below.

Equity securities at fair value as of September\n30, 2024 were $3.3 million, as a result of a $212 thousand increase in the fair value in the third quarter 2024. The fair value of equity securities increased $355\nthousand in the third quarter 2023. No equity securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe amortized cost of securities pledged as collateral, to secure public deposits and for other purposes, was $640.8 million at September 30, 2024 and\n$761.5 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe amortized cost of securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to $328.4 million at September 30, 2024 and $333.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n15\nCTBI evaluates its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for impairment. The analysis performed as of September 30, 2024 indicates that all\nimpairment is considered temporary, market and interest rate driven, and not credit-related. The percentage of total debt securities with unrealized losses as\nof September 30, 2024 was 94.3% compared to 97.3% as of December 31, 2023.

The contractual terms of those investments do\nnot permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than par which will equal amortized cost at maturity. CTBI does not intend to sell the investments\nand it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost.\nState and Political Subdivisions\nThe unrealized losses in securities of state and political subdivisions were caused by interest rate changes. The contractual terms of those investments\ndo not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than par which will equal amortized cost at maturity.

CTBI expects to\nrecover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. CTBI does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be\nrequired to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost.\n17\nAsset-Backed Securities\nThe unrealized losses in asset-backed securities were caused by interest rate changes.

Unearned fees included above totaled $0.4 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2023, while the unamortized premiums on the indirect lending portfolio totaled $30.9 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $31.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCTBI has segregated and evaluates our loan portfolio through nine portfolio segments with similar risk characteristics. CTBI serves customers in\nsmall and mid-sized communities in eastern, northeastern, central, and south central Kentucky, southern West Virginia, and northeastern Tennessee. Therefore,\nCTBI’s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in these communities.\nHotel/motel loans are a significant concentration for CTBI, representing approximately 10.4% of total loans. This industry has unique risk\ncharacteristics as it is highly susceptible to changes in the domestic and global economic environments, which can cause the industry to experience substantial\nvolatility. Additionally, any hotel/motel construction loans would be included in this segment as CTBI’s construction loans are primarily completed as one loan\ngoing from construction to permanent financing. These loans are originated based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt and secondarily based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial real estate residential loans are commercial purpose construction and permanent financed loans for commercial purpose 1-4 family/multi-\nfamily properties. These loans are originated based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt and secondarily based on the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral.\n18\nCommercial real estate nonresidential loans are secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, farmland, and other commercial real estate. These\nloans are originated based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt and secondarily based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Construction for\ncommercial real estate nonresidential loans are also included in this segment as these loans are generally one loan for construction to permanent financing.\nDealer floorplans consist of loans to dealerships to finance inventory and are collateralized under a blanket security agreement and without specific\nliens on individual units. This risk is mitigated by the use of periodic inventory audits. These audits are performed monthly and follow up is required on any\nout of compliance items identified. These audits are subject to increasing frequency when fact patterns suggest more scrutiny is required.\nCommercial other loans consist of agricultural loans, receivable financing, loans to financial institutions, loans for purchasing or carrying securities,\nand other commercial purpose loans. Commercial loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to service debt from the business’s underlying cash\nflows. As a general practice, we obtain collateral such as equipment, or other assets, although such loans may be uncollateralized but guaranteed.\nResidential real estate loans are a mixture of fixed rate and adjustable rate first and second lien residential mortgage loans and also include real estate\nconstruction loans which are typically for owner-occupied properties. The terms of the real estate construction loans are generally short-term with permanent\nfinancing upon completion. As a policy, CTBI holds adjustable rate loans and sells the majority of our fixed rate first lien mortgage loans into the secondary\nmarket. Changes in interest rates or market conditions may impact a borrower’s ability to meet contractual principal and interest payments. Residential real\nestate loans are secured by real property.\nHome equity lines are primarily revolving adjustable rate credit lines secured by real property.\nConsumer direct loans are a mixture of fixed rate and adjustable rate products comprised of unsecured loans, consumer revolving credit lines, deposit\nsecured loans, and all other consumer purpose loans.\nIndirect loans are primarily fixed rate consumer loans secured by automobiles, trucks, vans, and recreational vehicles originated at the selling\ndealership underwritten and purchased by CTBI’s indirect lending department. Both new and used products are financed. Only dealers who have executed\ndealer agreements with CTBI participate in the indirect lending program.\nNot included in the loan balances above were loans held for sale in the amount of $0.1 million at September 30, 2024 and $0.2 million at December\n31, 2023.\n19\nThe following tables present the balance in the ACL for the periods ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nProvision\nBeginning Charged to Losses Ending\n(in thousands) Balance Expense Charged Off Recoveries Balance\nACL\nHotel/motel $ 4,447 $ 581 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,028\nCommercial real estate residential 4,349 139 0 5 4,493\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 8,706 388 0 6 9,100\nDealer floorplans 561 78 0 0 639\nCommercial other 3,385 53 (278) 228 3,388\nReal estate mortgage 11,840 651 (37) 6 12,460\nHome equity 1,318 63 (40) 5 1,346\nConsumer direct 3,604 65 (249) 43 3,463\nConsumer indirect 13,938 718 (2,132) 919 13,443\nTotal $ 52,148 $ 2,736 $ (2,736) $ 1,212 $ 53,360\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nProvision\nBeginning Charged to Losses Ending\n(in thousands) Balance Expense Charged Off Recoveries Balance\nACL\nHotel/motel $ 4,592 $ 436 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,028\nCommercial real estate residential 4,285 189 0 19 4,493\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 7,560 1,481 0 59 9,100\nDealer floorplans 659 (20) 0 0 639\nCommercial other 3,760 316 (1,124) 436 3,388\nReal estate mortgage 10,197 2,327 (88) 24 12,460\nHome equity 1,367 6 (40) 13 1,346\nConsumer direct 3,261 999 (971) 174 3,463\nConsumer indirect 13,862 2,630 (6,016) 2,967 13,443\nTotal $ 49,543 $ 8,364 $ (8,239) $ 3,692 $ 53,360\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nProvision\nBeginning Charged to Losses Ending\n(in thousands) Balance Expense Charged Off Recoveries Balance\nACL\nHotel/motel $ 5,171 $ (579) $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,592\nCommercial real estate residential 4,894 (706) (28) 125 4,285\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 9,419 (2,252) (294) 687 7,560\nDealer floorplans 1,776 (1,117) 0 0 659\nCommercial other 5,285 (91) (1,900) 466 3,760\nReal estate mortgage 7,932 2,364 (140) 41 10,197\nHome equity 1,106 278 (23) 6 1,367\nConsumer direct 1,694 1,804 (541) 304 3,261\nConsumer indirect 8,704 7,110 (5,333) 3,381 13,862\nTotal $ 45,981 $ 6,811 $ (8,259) $ 5,010 $ 49,543\n20\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nProvision\nBeginning Charged to Losses Ending\n(in thousands) Balance Expense Charged Off Recoveries Balance\nACL\nHotel/motel $ 5,192 $ 611 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,803\nCommercial real estate residential 3,749 66 0 9 3,824\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 7,797 181 0 39 8,017\nDealer floorplans 1,157 (314) 0 0 843\nCommercial other 6,176 (595) (195) 159 5,545\nReal estate mortgage 7,884 439 (4) 17 8,336\nHome equity 1,108 59 (10) 1 1,158\nConsumer direct 2,563 157 (148) 41 2,613\nConsumer indirect 12,392 1,267 (1,655) 576 12,580\nTotal $ 48,018 $ 1,871 $ (2,012) $ 842 $ 48,719\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nProvision\nBeginning Charged to Losses Ending\n(in thousands) Balance Expense Charged Off Recoveries Balance\nACL\nHotel/motel $ 5,171 $ 632 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,803\nCommercial real estate residential 4,894 (1,132) (28) 90 3,824\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 9,419 (1,765) (9) 372 8,017\nDealer floorplans 1,776 (933) 0 0 843\nCommercial other 5,285 1,376 (1,455) 339 5,545\nReal estate mortgage 7,932 470 (99) 33 8,336\nHome equity 1,106 71 (23) 4 1,158\nConsumer direct 1,694 1,069 (386) 236 2,613\nConsumer indirect 8,704 5,208 (3,730) 2,398 12,580\nTotal $ 45,981 $ 4,996 $ (5,730) $ 3,472 $ 48,719\nUsing the ACL software, forecasts include gross domestic product (GDP), retail sales and housing price index considerations. CTBI leverages\neconomic projections from the Federal Open Market Committee to obtain various forecasts for unemployment rate and gross domestic product, the PNC\nforecast for the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, and the Wells Fargo forecast for the Advanced Retail Sales. CTBI has elected to forecast the first four\nquarters of the credit loss estimate and revert to a long-run average of each considered economic factor, as permitted in ASC 326-20-30-9, over four quarters.\nAll periods during the reasonable and supportable forecast period are utilizing a forecasted probability of default. Loss driver analysis was performed\nduring which regression models were built relating default rates of the various segments to the economic factors noted above. Historical loss data for both\nCTBI and segment-specific selected peers was incorporated from Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council call report data. For loss given default,\nthe Frye-Jacobs LGD estimation technique was utilized in the ACL software, providing a risk curve that most approximates the asset class under consideration.\nManagement elected to evaluate internal prepayment experience over a trailing timeframe to determine the appropriate prepayment and curtailment rates to be\nused in the credit loss estimate.\n21\nCTBI uses management judgement for qualitative loss factors such as delinquency trends, supervision and administration, quality control exceptions,\ncollateral values, and industry concentrations. The ACL software allows management to approve a “worst case” scenario or a maximum loss rate for each\nsegment. Qualitative dollars available for allocation then become the difference between the worst case and the ACL quantitative reserve estimate. Each factor\nis then given a risk weighting that is applied to determine a basis point allocation. The qualitative loss factors are as follows:\n• Changes in delinquency trends by loan segment\n• Changes in international, national, regional, and local conditions\n• The effect of other external factors (i.e. competition, legal and regulatory requirements) on the level of estimated credit losses\n• The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the levels of such concentrations\n• A supervision and administration allocation based on CTBI’s loan review process\n• Exceptions in lending policies and procedures as measured by quarterly loan portfolio exceptions reports\n• Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans\nRefer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our nonaccrual policy.

Cash payments received on nonaccrual\nloans generally are applied against principal, and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is reasonably assured. Any loans greater than 90\ndays past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest.

This industry has unique risk\ncharacteristics as it is highly susceptible to changes in the domestic and global economic environments, which can cause the industry to experience substantial\nvolatility. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Hotel/motel lending typically involves higher\nloan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business\nconducted on the property securing the loan. Management monitors and evaluates all commercial real estate loans based on collateral and risk grade criteria.\nCommercial construction loans generally are made to customers for the purpose of building income-producing properties, and any hotel/motel construction\nloan would be included in this segment. Personal guarantees of the principals are generally required. Such loans are made on a projected cash flow basis and\nare secured by the project being constructed. Construction loan draw procedures are included in each specific loan agreement, including required\ndocumentation items and inspection requirements. Construction loans may convert to term loans at the end of the construction period, or may be repaid by the\ntake-out commitment from another financing source. If the loan is to convert to a term loan, the repayment ability is based on the borrower’s projected cash\nflow. Risk is mitigated during the construction phase by requiring proper documentation and inspections whenever a draw is requested.\nCommercial real estate residential loans are commercial purpose construction and permanent financed loans for commercial purpose 1-4 family/multi-\nfamily properties. All commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Management\nmonitors and evaluates all commercial real estate loans based on collateral and risk grade criteria. Commercial residential construction loans generally are\nmade to customers for the purpose of building income-producing properties. Personal guarantees of the principals are generally required. Such loans are made\non a projected cash flow basis and are secured by the project being constructed. Construction loan draw procedures are included in each specific loan\nagreement, including required documentation items and inspection requirements. Construction loans may convert to term loans at the end of the construction\nperiod, or may be repaid by the take-out commitment from another financing source. If the loan is to convert to a term loan, the repayment ability is based on\nthe borrower’s projected cash flow. Risk is mitigated during the construction phase by requiring proper documentation and inspections whenever a draw is\nrequested.\n24\nCommercial real estate nonresidential loans are secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, farmland, and other commercial real estate.\nConstruction for commercial real estate nonresidential loans are also included in this segment as these loans are generally one loan for construction to\npermanent financing. All commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Management\nmonitors and evaluates all commercial real estate loans based on collateral and risk grade criteria. Commercial nonresidential construction loans generally are\nmade to customers for the purpose of building income-producing properties. Personal guarantees of the principals are generally required. Such loans are made\non a projected cash flow basis and are secured by the project being constructed. Construction loan draw procedures are included in each specific loan\nagreement, including required documentation items and inspection requirements. Construction loans may convert to term loans at the end of the construction\nperiod, or may be repaid by the take-out commitment from another financing source. If the loan is to convert to a term loan, the repayment ability is based on\nthe borrower’s projected cash flow. Risk is mitigated during the construction phase by requiring proper documentation and inspections whenever a draw is\nrequested.\nDealer floorplans are segmented separately as they are a unique product with unique risk factors. CTBI maintains strict processing procedures over\nour floorplan product with any exceptions requested by a loan officer approved by the appropriate loan committee and the floorplan manager.\nCommercial other loans are primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the\nborrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial\nloans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee;\nhowever, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the\nrepayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from our customers. As we underwrite our\nequipment lease financing in a manner similar to our commercial loan portfolio described below, the risk characteristics for this portfolio mirror that of the\ncommercial loan portfolio.\nWith respect to residential loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner occupied, CTBI generally establishes a maximum\nloan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4\nfamily residences. Residential construction loans are handled through the home mortgage area of the bank. The repayment ability of the borrower and the\nmaximum loan-to-value ratio are calculated using the normal mortgage lending criteria. Draws are processed based on percentage of completion stages\nincluding normal inspection procedures. Such loans generally convert to term loans after the completion of construction.\nConsumer loans are secured by consumer assets such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer loans are unsecured such as small\ninstallment loans and certain lines of credit. Our determination of a borrower’s ability to repay these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and\ncredit rating of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Risk is mitigated by the fact\nthat the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.\nThe indirect lending area of the bank is generally responsible for purchasing/funding consumer contracts with new and used automobile dealers.\nDealer loan applications are forwarded to the indirect loan processing area for approval or denial. Loan approvals or denials are based on the creditworthiness\nand repayment ability of the borrowers, and on the collateral value. Upon a dealer being funded on an approved loan application and assignment of the retail\ninstallment contract to CTB, CTB will have limited recourse with the dealer, as set forth in the CTB dealer agreement. On occasion, the dealer will execute a\nseparate, full recourse agreement with CTB to obtain customer financing.\n25\nCredit Quality Indicators:\nCTBI categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial\ninformation, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. CTBI also considers\nthe fair value of the underlying collateral and the strength and willingness of the guarantor(s). CTBI analyzes commercial loans individually by classifying the\nloans as to credit risk. Loans classified as loss, doubtful, substandard, or special mention are reviewed quarterly by CTBI for further deterioration or\nimprovement to determine if appropriately classified and valued if deemed impaired. All other commercial loan reviews are completed every 12 to 18 months.\nIn addition, during the renewal process of any loan, as well as if a loan becomes past due or if other information becomes available, CTBI will evaluate the\nloan grade. CTBI uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\n➢ Pass grades include investment grade, low risk, moderate risk, and acceptable risk loans. The loans range from loans that have no chance of resulting\nin a loss to loans that have a limited chance of resulting in a loss. Customers in this grade have excellent to fair credit ratings. The cash flows are\nadequate to meet required debt repayments.\n➢ Watch graded loans are loans that warrant extra management attention but are not currently criticized. Loans on the watch list may be potential\ntroubled credits or may warrant “watch” status for a reason not directly related to the asset quality of the credit. The watch grade is a management\ntool to identify credits which may be candidates for future classification or may temporarily warrant extra management monitoring.\n➢ Other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) reflects loans that are currently protected but are potentially weak. These loans constitute an undue and\nunwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an\nunwarranted risk in light of circumstances surrounding a specific asset. Loans in this grade display potential weaknesses which may, if unchecked or\nuncorrected, inadequately protect CTBI’s credit position at some future date. The loans may be adversely affected by economic or market conditions.\n➢ Substandard grading indicates that the loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral\npledged. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt with the distinct possibility that\nCTBI will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n➢ Doubtful graded loans have the weaknesses inherent in the substandard grading with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or\nliquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is\nextremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to CTBI’s advantage or strengthen the\nasset(s), its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger,\nacquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.\n26\nThe following tables present

their accrual status at the time of their modification. As a result, if a loan is on nonaccrual at the time it is modified, it stays as\nnonaccrual, and if a loan is on accrual at the time of the modification, it generally stays on accrual. Commercial and consumer loans modified due to a\nborrower’s financial difficulty are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default. If a loan to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty subsequently defaults, CTBI evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. The table below represents the payment status of modified\nloans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the past 12 months as of September 30, 2024.\nPast Due Status (Amortized Cost Basis)\n(in thousands) Current 30-89 Days 90+ Days Nonaccrual\nHotel/motel $ 1,954 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0\nCommercial real estate residential 119 219 237 0\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 47 0 0 0\nDealer floorplans 0 0 0 0\nCommercial other 5,215 335 0 64\nReal estate mortgage 8,865 245 819 715\nHome equity lines 162 0 0 0\nConsumer direct 104 0 0 0\nConsumer indirect 280 64 0 0\nTotal $ 16,746 $ 863 $ 1,056 $ 779\n42\nThe table below represents the payment status of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the past 12 months as of September 30, 2023:\nPast Due Status (Amortized Cost Basis)\n(in thousands) Current 30-89 Days 90+ Days Nonaccrual\nHotel/motel $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0\nCommercial real estate residential 2,122 44 0 0\nCommercial real estate nonresidential 9,813 0 26 0\nDealer floorplans 0 0 0 0\nCommercial other 1,060 320 345 264\nReal estate mortgage 3,935 1,442 139 349\nHome equity lines 519 100 0 22\nConsumer direct 207 3 0 0\nConsumer indirect 366 29 0 0\nTotal $ 18,022 $ 1,938 $ 510 $ 635\nThe allowance for credit losses may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to\nfurther write-down the carrying value of the loan. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were five loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty that subsequently defaulted. CTBI considers a loan in default when it is 90 days or more past due or transferred to nonaccrual. Presented below,\nsegregated by loan segment, are loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default during the periods indicated and\nsuch default was within twelve months of the loan modification.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Number of Loans Recorded Balance\nReal estate mortgage 5 $ 467\nTotal loans experiencing financial difficulty 5 $ 467\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Number of Loans Recorded Balance\nCommercial real estate residential 1 $ 237\nCommercial other 4 316\nReal estate mortgage 8 1,263\nTotal loans experiencing financial difficulty 13 $ 1,816\nFinancial instrument credit losses apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. A\nliability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet exposures is recognized if the entity has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the\nobligation is not unconditionally cancellable by the entity. Changes in this allowance are reflected in other operating expenses within the non-interest expense\ncategory. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total unfunded commitment off-balance sheet credit exposure was $1.5 million.\n43\nNote 5 – Other Real Estate Owned\nActivity for other real estate owned was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance of other real estate owned $ 1,626 $ 2,047 $ 1,616 $ 3,671\nNew assets acquired 14 325 488 500\nCapitalized costs 0 7 13 46\nFair value adjustments 0 (124) (49) (230)\nSale of assets (296) (80) (724) (1,812)\nEnding balance of other real estate owned $ 1,344 $ 2,175 $ 1,344 $ 2,175\nCarrying costs and fair value adjustments associated with foreclosed properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $13\nthousand and $0.2 million, respectively.

The primary risk with our repurchase agreements is market risk associated with the securities securing the transactions, as we may be\nrequired to provide additional collateral based on fair value changes of the underlying securities. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements\nare maintained with our safekeeping agents. The carrying value of investment securities available-for-sale pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements\ntotaled $297.7 million and $296.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n44\nThe remaining contractual maturity of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase by class of collateral pledged included in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is presented in the following tables:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRemaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements\nOvernight Greater\nand Up to Than\n(in thousands) Continuous 30 days 30-90 days 90 days Total\nRepurchase agreements and repurchase-to-maturity\ntransactions:\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 21,644 $ 0 $ 21 $ 29,911 $ 51,576\nState and political subdivisions 105,022 0 1,897 9,485 116,404\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities 17,124 0 542 44,190 61,856\nAsset-backed securities 3,488 0 0 0 3,488\nTotal $ 147,278 $ 0 $ 2,460 $ 83,586 $ 233,324\nDecember 31, 2023\nRemaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements\nOvernight Greater\nand Up to Than\n(in thousands) Continuous 30 days 30-90 days 90 days Total\nRepurchase agreements and repurchase-to-maturity\ntransactions:\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 21,156 $ 19 $ 1,817 $ 23,640 $ 46,632\nState and political subdivisions 98,053 481 5,962 3,219 107,715\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities 17,538 0 41,521 9,269 68,328\nAsset-backed securities 2,570 0 0 0 2,570\nTotal $ 139,317 $ 500 $ 49,300 $ 36,128 $ 225,245\nNote 7 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair\nvalue measurements. ASC 820 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use\nof fair value in any new circumstances. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In\nthis standard, the FASB clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the exit price when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle,\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Inputs – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might\ninclude quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as\ninterest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n45\nLevel 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in determining an exit price for the assets or liabilities.\nRecurring Measurements\nThe following tables present the fair value measurements of assets recognized in the accompanying balance sheets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques.\nFair Value Measurements at\nSeptember 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets measured – recurring basis\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 344,200 $ 329,996 $ 14,204 $ 0\nState and political subdivisions 265,871 0 265,871 0\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities 438,749 0 438,749 0\nAsset-backed securities 49,256 0 49,256 0\nEquity securities at fair value 3,266 0 0 3,266\nMortgage servicing rights 7,091 0 0 7,091\nFair Value Measurements at\nDecember 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets measured – recurring basis\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 354,817 $ 336,285 $ 18,532 $ 0\nState and political subdivisions 264,945 0 264,945 0\nU.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities 456,736 0 456,736 0\nAsset-backed securities 87,226 0 87,226 0\nEquity securities at fair value 3,158 0 0 3,158\nMortgage servicing rights 7,665 0 0 7,665\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the\naccompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. These valuation methodologies were\napplied to all of CTBI’s financial assets carried at fair value. CTBI had no liabilities measured and recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For assets classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.\n46\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nSecurities classified as AFS are reported at fair value on a recurring basis. U.S. Treasury and government agencies are classified as Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy where quoted market prices are available in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, CTBI obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service, such as Interactive Data, which\nutilizes pricing models to determine fair value measurement. CTBI reviews the pricing quarterly to verify the reasonableness of the pricing. The fair value\nmeasurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade\nexecution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the bond’s terms and conditions, among other factors. U.S. Treasury and\ngovernment agencies, state and political subdivisions, U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities are\nclassified as Level 2 inputs.\nIn certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Fair value determinations\nfor Level 3 measurements are estimated on a quarterly basis where assumptions used are reviewed to ensure the estimated fair value complies with accounting\nstandards generally accepted in the United States.\nEquity Securities at Fair Value\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the only securities owned by CTBI that were valued using Level 3 criteria are Visa Class B Stock\n(included in equity securities at fair value). Fair value for Visa Class B Stock is determined by an independent third party utilizing assumptions about factors\nsuch as quarterly common stock dividend payments, the conversion of the securities to the relevant Class A Stock shares subject to the prevailing conversion\nrate, and conversion date. We have concluded the third party assumptions, processes, and conclusions to be reasonable and appropriate in determining the fair\nvalue of this asset. See the tables below for inputs and valuation techniques used for Level 3 equity securities.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. CTBI reports MSRs at fair value on a\nrecurring basis with subsequent remeasurement of MSRs based on change in fair value.\nIn determining fair value, CTBI utilizes the expertise of an independent third party. Accordingly, fair value is determined by the independent third\nparty by utilizing assumptions about factors such as mortgage interest rates, discount rates, mortgage loan prepayment speeds, market trends, and industry\ndemand. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Fair value determinations for Level 3 measurements of\nMSRs are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis where assumptions used are reviewed to ensure the estimated fair value complies with GAAP.

For assets classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.\nCollateral Dependent Loans\nThe estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. Collateral-\ndependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCTBI considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the\nenvironment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral-dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined to be\ncollateral-dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Chief Credit Officer. Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and consistency by the Chief\nCredit Officer. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to\nconsider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and\nestimates are developed by the Chief Credit Officer by comparison to historical results.\nLoans considered collateral dependent are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the\ncollateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty in accordance with ASC 326-20-35-5. There were no fair value adjustments on collateral-\ndependent loans disclosed above for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Fair value adjustments were $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. There were no collateral dependent loans as of September 30, 2023, while losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $0.3 million.\n49\nOther Real Estate Owned\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, other real estate owned (“OREO”) is carried at the lower of fair value\nat acquisition date or current estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell when the real estate is acquired. Estimated fair value of OREO is based on\nappraisals or evaluations. OREO is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Long-lived assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to\nreflect subsequent partial write-downs that are based on the observable market price or current appraised value of the collateral. There were no fair value\nadjustments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The fair value adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on OREO disclosed above\nwere $6 thousand. Losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $0.1 million.\nOur policy for determining the frequency of periodic reviews is based upon consideration of the specific properties and the known or perceived market\nfluctuations in a particular market and is typically between 12 and 18 months but generally not more than 24 months. Appraisers are selected from the list of\napproved appraisers maintained by management.\nUnobservable (Level 3) Inputs\nThe following tables present quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in recurring and nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value at Range\nSeptember 30, Valuation (Weighted\n(in thousands) 2024 Technique(s) Unobservable Input Average)\nDiscount cash flows, computer pricing 8.0% - 12.0%\nEquity securities at fair value $ 3,266 model Discount rate (10.0%)\nDec 2025 - Dec 2029\nConversion date (Dec 2027)\nDiscount cash flows, computer pricing 0.0% - 26.0%\nMortgage servicing rights $ 7,091 model Constant prepayment rate (6.9%)\n0.0% - 100%\nProbability of default (0.9%)\n9.8% - 12.0%\nDiscount rate (10.0%)\n11.5% - 18.9%\nCollateral dependent loans $ 8,318 Market comparable properties Marketability discount (12.6%)\n37.2% - 58.5%\nOther real estate owned $ 471 Market comparable properties Comparability adjustments (51.1%)\n50\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value at Range\nDecember 31, Valuation (Weighted\n(in thousands) 2023 Technique(s) Unobservable Input Average)\nDiscount cash flows, computer pricing 15.0% - 25.0%\nEquity securities at fair value $ 3,158 model Discount rate (20.0%)\nDec 2028 - Dec 2032\nConversion date (Dec 2030)\nDiscount cash flows, computer pricing 0.0% - 77.6%\nMortgage servicing rights $ 7,665 model Constant prepayment rate (7.5%)\n0.0% - 66.7%\nProbability of default (1.0%)\n9.5% - 12.0%\nDiscount rate (10.0%)\nMarket comparable properties Marketability discount 10.9% - 19.6%\nCollateral dependent loans $ 8,397 (12.2%)\n10.0% - 23.9%\nOther real estate owned $ 205 Market comparable properties Comparability adjustments (17.5%)\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements\nThe following is a discussion of the uncertainty of fair value measurements, the interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs\nused in recurring fair value measurement, and how those inputs might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair\nvalue measurement.\nEquity Securities at Fair Value\nFair value for equity securities is derived based on unobservable inputs, such as the discount rate, quarterly dividends payable to the Visa Class B\ncommon stock, and the prevailing conversion rate at the conversion date. The most recent conversion rate of 1.5875 and the most recent dividend rate of 0.8255\nwere used to derive the fair value estimate. Significant increases (decreases) in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for discount rate is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the fair value\nestimate.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nFair value for MSRs is derived based on unobservable inputs, such as prepayment speeds of the underlying loans generated using the Andrew\nDavidson Prepayment Model, FHLMC/FNMA guidelines, the weighted average life of the loan, the discount rate, the weighted average coupon, and the\nweighted average default rate. Significant increases (decreases) in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value\nmeasurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for prepayment speeds is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the assumption for\ninterest rates.\n51\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents estimated fair value of CTBI’s financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and indicates the level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy of the valuation techniques. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the fair values as of September 30, 2024 were measured using\nan exit price notion.\nFair Value Measurements\nat September 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Amount (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 240,940 $ 240,940 $ 0 $ 0\nCertificates of deposit in other banks 245 0 245 0\nDebt securities available-for-sale 1,098,076 329,996 768,080 0\nEquity securities at fair value 3,266 0 0 3,266\nLoans held for sale 115 118 0 0\nLoans, net 4,297,114 0 0 4,127,547\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 5,173 0 5,173 0\nFederal Reserve Bank stock 4,887 0 4,887 0\nAccrued interest receivable 23,770 0 23,770 0\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 4,838,262 $ 988,350 $ 3,508,210 $ 0\nRepurchase agreements 233,324 0 0 233,228\nFederal funds purchased 500 0 500 0\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 319 0 328 0\nLong-term debt 64,074 0 0 47,887\nAccrued interest payable 16,304 0 16,304 0\nUnrecognized financial instruments:\nLetters of credit $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0\nCommitments to extend credit 0 0 0 0\nForward sale commitments 0 0 0 0\n52\nThe following table presents estimated fair value of CTBI’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and indicates the level within the fair value\nhierarchy of the valuation techniques.\nFair Value Measurements\nat December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Amount (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 271,400 $ 271,400 $ 0 $ 0\nCertificates of deposit in other banks 245 0 245 0\nDebt securities available-for-sale 1,163,724 336,285 827,439 0\nEquity securities at fair value 3,158 0 0 3,158\nLoans held for sale 152 154 0 0\nLoans, net 4,001,363 0 0 3,745,477\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 4,712 0 4,712 0\nFederal Reserve Bank stock 4,887 0 4,887 0\nAccrued interest receivable 23,575 0 23,575 0\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 4,724,622 $ 1,260,690 $ 3,480,806 $ 0\nRepurchase agreements 225,245 0 0 225,187\nFederal funds purchased 500 0 500 0\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank 334 0 349 0\nLong-term debt 64,241 0 0 50,326\nAccrued interest payable 7,389 0 7,389 0\nUnrecognized financial instruments:\nLetters of credit $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0\nCommitments to extend credit 0 0 0 0\nForward sale commitments 0 0 0 0\nNote 8 – Revenue Recognition\nCTBI’s primary source of revenue is interest income generated from loans and investment securities. Interest income is recognized according to the\nterms of the financial instrument agreement over the life of the loan or investment security unless it is determined that the counterparty is unable to continue\nmaking interest payments. Interest income also includes prepaid interest fees from commercial customers, which approximates the interest foregone on the\nbalance of the loan prepaid.\nCTBI’s additional source of income, also referred to as noninterest income, includes service charges on deposit accounts, gains on sales of loans, trust\nand wealth management income, loan related fees, brokerage revenue, and other miscellaneous income and is largely based on contracts with customers. In\nthese cases, CTBI recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. CTBI\nconsiders a customer to be any party to which we will provide goods or services that are an output of CTBI’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration.\nThere is little seasonality with regards to revenue from contracts with customers and all inter-company revenue is eliminated when CTBI’s financial statements\nare consolidated.\nGenerally, CTBI enters into contracts with customers that are short-term in nature where the performance obligations are fulfilled and payment is\nprocessed at the same time. Such examples include revenue related to merchant fees, interchange fees, and investment services income. In addition, revenue\ngenerated from existing customer relationships such as deposit accounts are also considered short-term in nature, because the relationship may be terminated at\nany time and payment is processed at the time performance obligations are fulfilled. As a result, CTBI does not have contract assets, contract liabilities, or\nrelated receivable accounts for contracts with customers. In cases where collectability is a concern, CTBI does not record revenue.\n53\nGenerally, the pricing of transactions between CTBI and each customer is either (i) established within a legally enforceable contract between the two\nparties, as is the case with loan sales, or (ii) disclosed to the customer at a specific point in time, as is the case when a deposit account is opened or before a new\nloan is underwritten. Fees are usually fixed at a specific amount or as a percentage of a transaction amount. No judgment or estimates by management are\nrequired to record revenue related to these transactions and pricing is clearly identified within these contracts.\nCTBI primarily operates in Kentucky and contiguous areas. Therefore, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of CTBI as one\noperating segment.\nWe disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by contract-type and timing of revenue recognition, as we believe it best depicts how the\nnature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Noninterest income not generated from customers\nduring CTBI’s ordinary activities primarily relates to MSRs, gains/losses on the sale of investment securities, gains/losses on the sale of OREO, gains/losses on\nthe sale of property, plant and equipment, and income from bank owned life insurance.\nFor more information related to our components of noninterest income, see the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive\nIncome above.\nNote 9 – Earnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n(in thousands except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 22,142 $ 20,628 $ 60,320 $ 59,345\nDenominator:\nBasic earnings per share:\nWeighted average shares 17,962 17,893 17,942 17,882\nDiluted earnings per share:\nEffect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock grants 29 11 23 10\nAdjusted weighted average shares 17,991 17,904 17,965 17,892\nEarnings per share:\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.23 $ 1.15 $ 3.36 $ 3.32\nDiluted earnings per share 1.23 1.15 3.36 3.32\nThere were no options to purchase common shares that were excluded from the diluted calculations above for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.

Accruing loans 90+ days past due at $19.1 million increased $4.4 million from prior quarter and $9.2 million from December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual\nloans at $6.0 million increased $0.9 million from prior quarter and $1.9 million from December 31, 2023. Accruing loans 30-89 days past due at $20.6 million\ndecreased $3.5 million from prior quarter but increased $5.2 million from December 31, 2023. Our loan portfolio management processes focus on the\nimmediate identification, management, and resolution of problem loans to maximize recovery and minimize loss. Our loan portfolio risk management\nprocesses include weekly delinquent loan review meetings at the market levels and monthly delinquent loan review meetings involving senior corporate\nmanagement to review all nonaccrual loans and loans 30 days or more past due. Any activity regarding a criticized/classified loan (i.e. problem loan) must be\napproved by CTB’s Watch List Asset Committee (i.e. Problem Loan Committee). CTB’s Watch List Asset Committee also meets on a quarterly basis and\nreviews every criticized/classified loan of $100,000 or greater. CTB’s Loan Portfolio Risk Management Committee also meets quarterly focusing on the\noverall asset quality and risk metrics of the loan portfolio. We also have a Loan Review Department that reviews every market within CTB annually and\nperforms extensive testing of the loan portfolio to assure the accuracy of loan grades and classifications for delinquency, if a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty with significant payment delay, nonaccrual status, and adequate loan loss reserves. The Loan Review Department has annually reviewed, on average,\n97% of the outstanding commercial loan portfolio for the past three years. The average annual review percentage of the consumer and residential loan portfolio\nfor the past three years was 81% based on the loan production during the number of months included in the review scope. The review scope is generally four\nto six months of production. CTBI generally does not offer high risk loans such as option ARM products, high loan to value ratio mortgages, interest-only\nloans, loans with initial teaser rates, or loans with negative amortizations, and therefore, CTBI would have no significant exposure to these products.\nFor further information regarding nonperforming loans, see Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nWe had net loan charge-offs of $1.5 million, or 0.14% of average loans annualized, for the third quarter 2024 compared to $1.4 million, or 0.13% of\naverage loans annualized, for the second quarter 2024 and $1.2 million, or 0.12% of average loans annualized, for the third quarter 2023. Of the net charge-\noffs for the quarter, $1.2 million were in indirect consumer loans, $0.2 million were in direct consumer loans, and $0.1 million were in residential loans. Net\ncharge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $4.5 million, or 0.14% of average loans annualized, compared to $2.3 million, or 0.08% of\naverage loans annualized, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Year-to-date net loan charge-offs are in line with management’s expectations.\nDividends\nThe following schedule shows the quarterly cash dividends paid for the past six quarters:\nPay Date Record Date Amount Per Share\nOctober 1, 2024 September 15, 2024 $ 0.47\nJuly 1, 2024 June 15, 2024 $ 0.46\nApril 1, 2024 March 15, 2024 $ 0.46\nJanuary 1, 2024 December 15, 2023 $ 0.46\nOctober 1, 2023 September 15, 2023 $ 0.46\nJuly 1, 2023 June 15, 2023 $ 0.44\n63\nLiquidity and Market Risk\nThe objective of CTBI’s Asset/Liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within our policy limits. This\nobjective is accomplished through management of our consolidated balance sheet composition, liquidity, and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing\neconomic conditions, interest rates, and customer preferences. The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and\nlease demand or deposit withdrawals. This is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities,\nsufficient unused borrowing capacity, and growth in core deposits. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $240.9 million in cash and cash\nequivalents and approximately $186.0 million in unpledged securities valued at estimated fair value designated as available-for-sale and available to meet\nliquidity needs on a continuing basis compared to $271.4 million and $157.5 million at December 31, 2023. Additional asset-driven liquidity is provided by\nthe remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans. In addition to core deposit funding, we also have a variety of other short-term and long-\nterm funding sources available. We also rely on Federal Home Loan Bank advances for both liquidity and management of our asset/liability position. Federal\nHome Loan Bank advances were $0.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had a $517.1 million available\nborrowing position with the Federal Home Loan Bank, compared to $476.2 million at December 31, 2023. We generally rely upon net inflows of cash from\nfinancing activities, supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities, to provide cash for our investing activities. As is typical of many financial\ninstitutions, significant financing activities include deposit gathering, use of short-term borrowing facilities such as repurchase agreements and federal funds\npurchased, and issuance of long-term debt. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $50 million in lines of credit with various correspondent\nbanks available to meet any future cash needs. Our primary investing activities include purchases of securities and loan originations. We do not rely on any\none source of liquidity and manage availability in response to changing consolidated balance sheet needs. Included in our cash and cash equivalents at\nSeptember 30, 2024 were deposits with the Federal Reserve of $146.3 million, compared to $207.6 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, we project\ncash flows from our investment portfolio to generate additional liquidity over the next 90 days.\nThe investment portfolio consists of investment grade short-term issues suitable for bank investments. The majority of the investment portfolio is in\nU.S. government and government sponsored agency issuances. At September 30, 2024, available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities comprised all of the total\ninvestment portfolio, and the AFS portfolio was approximately 144% of equity capital. Eighty-four percent of the pledge-eligible portfolio was pledged.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe consider interest rate risk one of our most significant market risks. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due\nto changes in interest rates. Consistency of our net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. We employ a\nvariety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our interest rate risk, including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest\nincome sensitivity to changing interest rates. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off-balance sheet instruments\nand incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. Assumptions\nbased on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions\nare inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates\non net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in\nmarket conditions and management strategies.\nCTBI’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which includes executive and senior management representatives and reports to the Board\nof Directors, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board-approved policy limits. Our current exposure to interest rate risks is determined by\nmeasuring the anticipated change in net interest income spread evenly over the twelve-month period.\nCapital Resources\nWe continue to offer a dividend to our shareholders, providing an annualized dividend yield for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of 3.79%. Our\nprimary source of capital growth is the retention of earnings. Cash dividends were $1.39 per share and $1.34 per share for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We retained 58.6% of our earnings for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 59.6% for the first nine months of 2023.\n64\nInsured depository institutions are required to meet certain capital level requirements. On October 29, 2019, federal banking regulators adopted a final\nrule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible community banks and holding companies that opt-in to the community bank leverage ratio\nframework (the “CBLR framework”), as required by Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Under the final rule,\nwhich became effective as of January 1, 2020, community banks and holding companies (which includes CTB and CTBI) that satisfy certain qualifying\ncriteria, including having less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets and a leverage ratio (referred to as the “community bank leverage ratio”) of\ngreater than 9%, were eligible to opt-in to the CBLR framework. The community bank leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to\nits average total consolidated assets, both as reported on the banking organization’s applicable regulatory filings. Accordingly, a qualifying community banking\norganization that has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9% will be considered to have met: (i) the risk-based and leverage capital requirements of\nthe generally applicable capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements in order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action\nframework; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements.\nIn April 2020, as directed by Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the regulatory agencies introduced temporary\nchanges to the CBLR. These changes, which subsequently were adopted as a final rule, temporarily reduced the CBLR requirement to 8% through the end of\ncalendar year 2020. Beginning in calendar year 2021, the CBLR requirement increased to 8.5% for the calendar year before returning to 9% in calendar year\n2022. Management elected to use the CBLR framework for CTBI and CTB. CTBI’s CBLR ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 13.99%. CTB’s CBLR ratio\nas of September 30, 2024 was 13.51%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we are not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which, if they were to be\nimplemented, would have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material adverse impact on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations.\nImpact of Inflation, Changing Prices, and Economic Conditions\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Therefore, CTBI differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that\nhave significant investment in nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of\nassets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets\nratio. Inflation also affects other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation.\nWe believe one of the most significant impacts on financial and operating results is our ability to react to changes in interest rates. We seek to\nmaintain an essentially balanced position between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate\nfluctuations.\nStock Repurchase Program\nCTBI’s stock repurchase program began in December 1998 with the authorization to acquire up to 500,000 shares and was increased by an additional\n1,000,000 shares in each of July 2000, May 2003, and March 2020. CTBI repurchased 32,664 shares of its common stock during the first quarter 2020, leaving\n1,034,706 shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 2,465,294 shares have been repurchased through\nthis program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”) requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events\nand their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined\nwith certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are\nconstantly reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found our application of accounting\npolicies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates.\n65\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. We have identified the following\ncritical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Credit Losses – CTBI accounts for the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments in accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and its related subsequent amendments, commonly known as\nCECL.\nWe disaggregate our portfolio loans into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ACL. Our loan portfolio segments include commercial,\nresidential mortgage, and consumer. We further disaggregate our portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based\non certain risk characteristics. For an analysis of CTBI’s ACL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 4 to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contained herein.\nCTBI maintains the ACL to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related\nloans. Effective January 1, 2023, CTBI implemented ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures, an amendment to ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables—\nTroubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty along with requiring that disclosures be added by year of origination for gross charge-off information for financing\nreceivables. Accrued interest receivable on loans is presented in the consolidated financial statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is\ndeemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest income is reversed. In the event that collection of principal becomes\nuncertain, CTBI has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, CTBI elected ASU 2019-04 which allows that accrued interest\nwould continue to be presented separately and not part of the amortized cost of the loan. For additional information on CTBI’s accounting policies related to\nnonaccrual loans, refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein.\nCredit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ACL. The ACL is maintained at a level CTBI considers to be adequate and is based on\nongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans, including historical credit loss experience, current and forecasted market and\neconomic conditions, and consideration of various qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration in estimating expected credit\nlosses. Provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the ACL to CTBI’s current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio\nloans. CTBI’s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and\nconservative underwriting, documentation, and collection standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry, and customer\nlevel, regular credit examinations, and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.\nCTBI’s methodology for determining the ACL requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a\ncollective basis for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans which are individually evaluated.\n66\nLarger commercial loans with balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses and (i) have a criticized risk rating,\n(ii) are on nonaccrual status, (iii) have a borrower experiencing financial difficulty with significant payment delay, or (iv) are 90 days or more past due, are\nindividually evaluated for an ACL. CTBI considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor’s liquidity and willingness to\ncooperate, the loan structure and other factors when determining the amount of the ACL. Other factors may include the borrower’s susceptibility to risks\npresented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment, the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash\nflow and leverage of the borrower, and our evaluation of the borrower’s management. Significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of\nthese factors are most relevant in individual circumstances, and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors. When loans are\nindividually evaluated, allowances are determined based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of\ncollateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to CTBI. Allowances for individually evaluated loans that are\ncollateral-dependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less expected costs to sell where applicable. For collateral-\ndependent financial assets, the credit loss expected may be zero if the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the amortized cost of the loan. Loans shall not be\nincluded in both collective assessments and individual assessments. Individually evaluated loans that are not collateral-dependent are measured based on the\npresent value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. Specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans,\nincluding loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral\nconditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. Regardless of an initial measurement method, once it is determined that foreclosure is probable, the\nACL is measured based on the fair value of the collateral as of the measurement date. As a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral may be used for a\nloan when determining the ACL for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The fair value shall be adjusted for selling costs when foreclosure is probable.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans that are not individually evaluated. These include commercial loans that do not\nmeet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments. CTBI uses a third party\nACL software to calculate reserve estimates. Discounted cash flow (“DCF”) modeling was used for all loan segments. The primary reasons that contributed to\nthis decision were: DCF models allow for the effective incorporation of a reasonable and supportable forecast in a directionally consistent and objective\nmanner; the analysis aligns well with other calculations outside of the ACL estimation which will mitigate model risk in other areas; and peer data is available\nfor certain inputs if first party data is not available or meaningful. Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans that are not individually\nevaluated. These include commercial loans that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and\nconsumer portfolio segments. See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for information on CTBI’s risk rating system.\nCTBI’s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, peer data, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted\nchanges in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, CTBI considers our forecasts to be\nreasonable and supportable for a period of up to one year from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period,\nexpected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information. CTBI evaluates the length of our reasonable and supportable forecast period,\nour reversion period, and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances.\nOther qualitative factors are used by CTBI in determining the ACL. These considerations inherently require significant management judgment to\ndetermine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the ACL estimate. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in\nthe portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within CTBI’s expected credit loss models. These include adjustments for\nchanges in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, lending and risk management personnel, and results of internal audit and quality\ncontrol reviews. These may also include adjustments, when deemed necessary, for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events, natural disasters and\ntheir effects on regional borrowers, and changes in product structures. Qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key\ninputs and assumptions within CTBI’s expected credit loss models, such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period, changes to historical loss\ninformation, or changes to the reversion period or methodology. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is also given to regional\ngeographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on CTBI’s customers.\n67\nOverall, the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into\nthe models, as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments. CTBI’s forecasts of market\nand economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss\nmodels that require significant management judgment. These inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting ACL.\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses\nrelated to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is\nbased upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments, taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated\nexposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the\ndetermination of the adequacy of CTBI’s ACL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other\nnoninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nGoodwill – Business combinations entered into by CTBI typically include the recognition of goodwill. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for\nimpairment on an annual basis, which for CTBI is October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to\nNote 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for a discussion on the methodology used by CTBI to assess goodwill for\nimpairment.\nImpairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP\npermits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. In this\nqualitative assessment, CTBI evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking\nindustry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of CTBI, and the performance of CTBI’s common stock, to determine if it is not more likely\nthan not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is\nelected, CTBI performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing its fair value with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds\nits fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill recorded. A recognized impairment\nloss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.\nThe fair value of CTBI is the price that would be received to sell the company as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The determination of the fair value is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash\nflows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. CTBI employs an income-based approach, utilizing forecasted cash flows and the\nestimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of the forecasted cash flows surrounding\nexpectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations, and actual results may differ from forecasted results.\nFair Value Measurements – As a financial services company, the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the\napplication of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, such as available-for-sale investment securities. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not\nmeasured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established. Given the inherent volatility, the use of fair\nvalue measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities or result in material changes to the consolidated financial\nstatements from period to period. Detailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements contained herein.\n68\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within Board-approved policy limits. CTBI uses an\nearnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. Given a 200 basis point increase to the yield curve used in\nthe simulation model, it is estimated net interest income for CTBI would increase by 1.11% over one year and 2.08% over two years. A 200 basis point\ndecrease in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated 2.57% over one year and 5.65% over two years. For further discussion of\nCTBI’s market risk, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Market Risk included in\nthe annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nCTBI’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e)\nand 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
