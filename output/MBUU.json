Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\nLOUDON, Tenn., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Malibu Boats, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBUU) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**First****Quarter Fiscal****2025****Highlights Compared to****First****Quarter Fiscal****2024****:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 32.9% to $171.6 million\n  * Unit volume decreased 39.7% to 1,024 units\n  * Gross profit decreased 50.3% to $28.2 million\n  * GAAP net income decreased 124.8% to a net loss of $5.1 million\n  * GAAP net income available to Class A Common Stock per share (diluted) decreased 125.5% to a net loss of $0.25 per share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 74.6% to $9.9 million\n  * Adjusted fully distributed net income per share decreased 92.9% to $0.08 per share on a fully distributed weighted-average share count of 20.6 million shares of Class A Common Stock\n\n\n\n\"During the first fiscal quarter, we continued to navigate a challenging retail environment. While we see some encouraging signs from a macro perspective, our team remains focused on managing the factors within our control, particularly through disciplined inventory management and executing our strategic initiatives,\" commented Steve Menneto, Chief Executive Officer of Malibu Boats, Inc. \"As we enter the boat show season, we are excited to display our 2025 lineup, which has already received strong initial reactions. This season presents an important opportunity to connect with customers and demonstrate the cutting-edge innovation and quality that sets us apart. Looking ahead, we are also pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day during calendar year 2025, during which we will provide further insights into our long-term vision to drive Malibu into its next chapter of growth.\"\n\n“As expected, our financial performance this quarter reflects sequential improvements across revenues and margins as we scaled back promotional activity and continued showcasing our operating efficiencies. We are pleased with our execution in reducing our channel inventories and we anticipate wholesale shipments to improve as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year,\" commented Bruce Beckman, Chief Financial Officer of Malibu Boats, Inc. \"Additionally, we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, repurchasing an additional $10 million of our common stock over the quarter, underscoring our confidence in the business. With a solid foundation, we are well positioned to respond quickly to dynamic market conditions and continue positioning ourselves to deliver value to our shareholders.\"\n\n**First****Quarter Fiscal****2025****Results (Unaudited)**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n(Dollars In Thousands)  \nNet Sales| $| 171,580| $| 255,830  \nGross Profit| $| 28,209| $| 56,794  \nGross Profit Margin| 16.4| %| 22.2| %  \nNet (Loss) Income| $| (5,147| )| $| 20,770  \nNet (Loss) Income Margin| (3.0)%| 8.1| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 9,895| $| 38,988  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 5.8| %| 15.2| %  \n  \nNet sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $84.3 million, or 32.9%, to $171.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased unit volumes across all segments resulting primarily from decreased wholesale shipments, partially offset by a favorable model mix in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Unit volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 674 units, or 39.7%, to 1,024 units as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our unit volume decreased primarily due to lower wholesale shipments across all segments driven by lower retail activity and our dealers' desire to hold less inventory.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Malibu segment decreased $49.0 million, or 46.7%, to $56.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu segment decreased 420 units for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and our dealers' desire to hold less inventory. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased $27.9 million, or 30.1%, to $64.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased 191 units for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and our dealers' desire to hold less inventory. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases and a favorable model mix.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Cobalt segment decreased $7.4 million, or 12.7%, to $50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to Cobalt decreased 63 units for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and our dealers' desire to hold less inventory. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a decrease in units, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nOverall consolidated net sales per unit increased 11.2% to $167,559 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in overall consolidated net sales per unit was driven primarily by favorable model mix in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Net sales per unit for our Malibu segment increased 11.7% to $145,883 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by favorable model mix, inflation-driven year-over-year price increases and non-boat related customer service parts sales. Net sales per unit for our Saltwater Fishing segment increased 14.4% to $215,837 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 driven by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer incentive costs. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment increased 3.5% to $149,441 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $55.7 million, or 28.0%, to $143.4 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 32.9% decrease in net sales due to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher per unit material and labor costs of $5.3 million, $6.8 million and $2.6 million for the Malibu, Saltwater Fishing, and Cobalt segments, respectively. The increase in per unit material and labor costs was primarily driven by increased prices due to fixed cost deleverage, a model mix that corresponds to higher cost per unit in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments and inflationary pressures.\n\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $28.6 million, or 50.3%, to $28.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by lower net sales partially offset by decreased cost of sales for the reasons noted above. Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 580 basis points from 22.2% to 16.4% driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage due to lower sales and an increased mix of the Saltwater Fishing segment.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $0.9 million, or 15.4% to $4.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in certain personnel expenses and marketing events. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses increased 60 basis points to 2.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $6.5 million, or 31.6%, to $27.2 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven primarily by a $3.5 million legal settlement along with other related legal fees and increased stock compensation expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased 780 basis points to 15.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense remained flat at $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nOperating (loss) income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 decreased to an operating loss of $5.6 million from an operating income $28.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Net (loss) income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 decreased 124.8% to a net loss of $(5.1) million from net income of $20.8 million and net (loss) income margin decreased to (3.0)% from 8.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 decreased 74.6% to $9.9 million from $39.0 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 5.8% from 15.2% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Guidance**\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Malibu anticipates net sales increase percentage in the low single digits year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA margin ranging from 10%-12%.\n\nThe Company has not provided reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA margin, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include costs related to the Company’s vertical integration initiatives that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss first quarter of fiscal year 2025 results on Thursday, October 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Investors and analysts can participate on the conference call by dialing (844) 695-5523 or (412) 317-0699 and requesting Malibu Boats. Alternatively, interested parties can listen to a live webcast of the conference call by logging on to the Investor Relations section on the Company’s website at <https://malibuboatsinc.com/investor-information/events-presentations>. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on the Company’s website for twelve months.\n\n**About Malibu Boats, Inc.**\n\nBased in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc.

These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an indicator of our liquidity. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees, litigation settlements and non-cash compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net (loss) income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assist in highlighting trends in our operating results without regard to our financing methods, capital structure, and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity.\n\nCertain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\n\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax (benefit) expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the \"LLC\"), and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax (benefit) expense on fully distributed net income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc., before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net (loss) income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of our net (loss) income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and the numerator and denominator for our net (loss) income available to Class A Common Stock per share to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income per share of Class A Common Stock is provided under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes statements in this press release regarding our expectations for our financial performance for fiscal year 2025, our reaction to our 2025 lineup of boats, our expectations regarding wholesale shipments in the remainder of the fiscal year, our positioning to react to dynamic market conditions, and our ability to continue to deliver value for our stockholders.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: our large fixed cost base; our ability to execute our manufacturing strategy; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products; increases in the cost of, or unavailability of, raw materials, component parts and transportation costs; disruptions in our suppliers’ operations; our reliance on third-party suppliers for raw materials and components; our reliance on certain suppliers for our engines and outboard motors; climate events in areas where we operate; our ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs; our dependence on key management employees; our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and integrate such acquisitions to fully realize their expected benefits; our growth strategy which may require us to secure significant additional capital; our ability to enhance existing products and develop and market new or enhanced products; our ability to protect our intellectual property; compromises or disruptions to our network and information systems; risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions; general economic conditions; the continued strength and positive perception of our brands; the sale of boats previously held in inventory by our former dealer, Tommy's Boats; increased consumer preference for used boats, alternative fuel-powered boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand; the seasonality of our business; competition within our industry and with other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time; changes in currency exchange rates; inflation and heightened interest rates; our reliance on our network of independent dealers and increasing competition for dealers; the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing; our obligation to repurchase inventory of certain dealers; our exposure to risks associated with litigation, investigation and regulatory proceedings; an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets; any failure to comply with laws and regulations including environmental, workplace safety and other regulatory requirements; covenants in our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility which may limit our operating flexibility; our obligation to make certain payments under a tax receivable agreement; any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls or procedures; and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.

Having the industry and the boating world show such appreciation for an entire model – not to mention continued recognition for several years in a row – is very inspiring to our craftsmen and craftswomen who build these fantastic boats.\n\nAnderson continued, \"The 23 LSV is the best-selling watersports boat of all time because it fits the needs of so many families. This award just punctuates its market dominance. I have no doubt the 23 LSV’s versatility, performance, luxury, and style were the reasons it came out on top for the fifth year in a row.”\n\nThe Malibu Wakesetter 23 LSV combines sleek, traditional bow lines with groundbreaking technology and world-class watersports performance, all wrapped up in a stylish package. At 23 feet, the 23 LSV’s just-right size is a huge factor in its unprecedented popularity. With spacious seating for 16, the 23 LSV allows passengers to spread out in the luxurious wraparound lounge, and yet its mid-size hull remains manageable for mid-size tow vehicles. Malibu’s Wake Plus™ Hull creates pro-level wakes and waves with 23 feet of running surface, while maintaining exceptional nimbleness and maneuverability.\n\nVersatility is a key theme for the 23 LSV. Buyers can choose between two unique running surfaces:\n\n  * **Wake Plus™ Hull:** Ideal for wakeboarding and wakesurfing.\n  * **Malibu Diamond Hull™** : Perfect for families who enjoy mixing skiing into their watersports experience.\n\n\n\nThe 23 LSV’s game-changing wake-shaping devices can adjust its wakes and waves from beginner to pro levels with the touch of a button on the primary [Malibu Command Center™](https://www.malibuboats.com/news/2024-news/discover-malibu/only-malibu/truth-in-command-center) 12-inch touch screen.

With capacity for 16 people or 2,256 pounds, a total ballast of 4,102 pounds, including Power Wedge III™, and a 74-gallon fuel capacity, the M230 is perfectly equipped to power even the most action-packed day on the water.\n\n**Interior Features:****The Bow - Sophisticated and Flexible**\n\nThe M230 boasts an interior specifically designed for comfort and luxury, ensuring that everyone onboard has the best seat in the house.\n\nStarting in the bow, the M230 features a walkthrough bow seating area offering Malibu’s famously plush seating for two adults. The M230’s high freeboard ensures that passengers in its signature bow sit low in the boat where they will enjoy a spray-free ride, protected from the elements even in rough water. Should more seating be needed in the bow, Malibu’s patented, storable Natalie Seat back and filler cushion can be quickly installed to provide additional space. The Natalie Seat also doubles as a handy windbreak for the lounge and cockpit.\n\nThe upholstery throughout the M230 features the signature M-Series diamond stitching on the vinyl accent panels, adding a premium flourish to the ultra-plush seating onboard. Meanwhile, multiple built-in cup holders and wireless charging docks can be found throughout the boat, ensuring that your crew’s drinks are always nearby, and their phones are ready to capture the action.\n\n**The Lounge: Luxurious Comfort**\n\nMoving into the lounge, the observer seat boasts Malibu’s new Raise-&-Laze Armrest™. At the push of a button, a plush upholstered armrest raises up from the seat edge to make the observer seat even more comfortable.\n\nFor the ultimate in social versatility, the optional MaxPivot™ seat converts the wraparound lounge seating from a standard bench seat, into a dining table. It’s the perfect space for an on the water lunch with friends. When the table is not needed, the MaxPivot seat can instantly convert into either a sunbed or a rear-facing seat, ensuring that everybody can take in the action behind the boat.\n\n**The Transom: A Unique Social Area**\n\nThe M230’s transom boasts the E-Z Stash Board Locker™, a full-width rear storage tray system. Here, the sun pad effortlessly flips up in three sections (two gull wings and the central walkway section) all supported on gas spring-assisted hinges, to reveal a spacious wet storage area specifically designed for boards, wet lifejackets, and plenty of other watersports gear.\n\nWhen it’s time to relax at the sand bar or enjoy some time out from the action, the Max-Relax Sundeck Loungers™ adds two versatile backrests that can be set facing either toward the cockpit - for onboard socializing - or out over the stern, creating a unique, relaxing social hub at the transom. Built-in cup holders, optional transom misters, and remote stereo hub further add to the comfort and convenience offered by this area of the boat.\n\nStaying at the stern, easily removable filler cushion at the transom can be quickly lifted to reveal a triple-layer soft grip decking passage underneath. This creates an unbroken path of soft grip leading from the bow of the boat all the way to the swim platform, ensuring that nobody needs to step on the upholstery or vinyl while moving through the entire boat.\n\n**The 2025 Malibu Command Center**\n\nAll 2025 Malibu models, including the M230, proudly feature Malibu’s industry-leading Malibu Command Center™. Set to define the next generation of Malibu user experiences, the all-new Malibu Command Center is housed in a completely redesigned, sleek, dashboard design built to Malibu’s demanding standards.

The all-new mOS features customizable graphics themes with driver and rider profiles that deliver a new, more immersive experience for everyone on board. mOS ensures that all the boat’s key information is always easily visible while control of crucial systems is as simple as a few finger taps.\n\nIn addition to putting complete control over Malibu’s legendary Surf Gate® Fusion and Power Wedge® III systems at your fingertips, mOS includes pre-loaded model-specific, customizable watersports presets that can be accessed, instantly ready to generate world-class wakes and waves, ensuring memorable adventures for any skill level.\n\nAnd to ensure that every day out on the water ends where it began, navigation is now included in the Command Center as standard. Meanwhile, the convenient Go Home button automatically drains the ballast tanks, disengages cruise control, and stows Surf Gate Fusion and Power Wedge III, while you enjoy a relaxing ride back to the dock.\n\n**The Helm**\n\nThe M230’s helm is engineered for total comfort, ease-of-use and convenience, from the helm seat to the controls and the steering wheel, every detail has been carefully thought through to ensure the driving experience is both accessible and thrilling.\n\nA freshly introduced steering wheel takes center stage in front of the driver.

At the press of a button, the seat raises or lowers to ensure that every driver is as comfortable as possible.\n\n**G10+ Tower: Entertainment & Convenience**\n\nFirst introduced on 2024 models, the G10+ Tower is packed with an exciting array of technology and features designed to make both the rider and everyone’s experience on board unforgettable. Built-in RGB lighting can be controlled from the helm to create a personalized mood on board, while overhead lights illuminate the lounge as you stow your gear at the end of the day. Optional tower misters ensure everyone is cooled down even on the hottest days. The G10+ boasts Malibu’s fully electric Power Tower feature, ensuring that it can be quickly folded down with the turn of a dial, allowing the boat to effortlessly pass under bridges or stow in a boathouse or garage.\n\nAll-new for 2025, Malibu now offers Wet Sounds Rev 12 Tower Speakers with multi-sync RGB lighting, bringing unprecedented volume and sound quality to your on-water experience. Buyers can also select from a comprehensive non-metallic color selection on the speaker and tower, ensuring a customizable tower design that matches their boat exterior.\n\n**Below the Water: Engine and Surf Systems**\n\nThe Malibu M230’s surf experience is of course shaped by Malibu’s world-famous Surf Systems, including Surf Gate® Fusion and Power Wedge® III. In combination with Malibu’s in-house-built Monsoon M6Di engine or optional 607 HP, supercharged LT4 engine and the six hard-tank ballast system on board, riders of every level can enjoy an unforgettable surf experience tailored to their specific needs.\n\nOffering unmatched performance, fuel economy, reliability, and sound reduction, the Malibu M6Di engine offers accessible maintenance, a quieter ride, and improved stability, alongside power and torque levels that ensure the perfect wave for every rider, every time, no problem.\n\nMalibu’s Surf Gate® Fusion is the world’s first fully integrated surf system, creating the perfect wave at the simple touch of a button. Riders can choose to control their wave in real-time with Malibu’s Surf Band wearable controller as well. Power Wedge® III works in perfect harmony with Surf Gate Fusion, allowing for even further control and customization of the wake or wave for a perfect riding session.\n\nThe M230 includes six hard ballast tanks for a total ballast of 2,302 lbs. Controlled by the Malibu Command Center, the Hard Tank Ballast system ensures a consistently powerful and customizable surf wake, without the need for shifting passengers, belongings, or ballast bags around.\n\n**Industry-First: AIS Ballast Flush System**\n\nIn another industry first, Malibu Boats is now the only wakeboat company to offer an advanced, convenient Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) ballast flush system upgrade option on all 2025 Malibu models. The user simply connects a freshwater line to a single flush connection located at the transom and, at the press of a button on the Command Center, the AIS system automatically flushes every part of the hard tank ballast system, from seacock to thru-hull, ensuring a complete flush of the system every time, with minimal user effort.\n\nAn optional AIS/Salt Rinse Kit is also now available with every new Malibu trailer, further simplifying the Malibu boat ownership experience.\n\n**All-New Hi-Def Boat Builder**\n\nAlongside the rollout of these masterful innovations and technologies, Malibu Boats announces the launch of its new online consumer boat builder tool. This advanced new tool has been built from the ground up as a showcase of the vast customizability of Malibu Boats, brilliantly empowering users to build the boat of their dreams.

The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period, increased promotional costs and elevated dealer channel inventory levels. Unit volume for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 1,505 units, or 59.0%, to 1,045 units compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Our unit volume decreased primarily due to lower wholesale shipments across all segments. The decrease in wholesale shipments were driven by our efforts to address elevated channel inventory resulting from weakening retail demand experienced throughout the fiscal year.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Malibu segment decreased $122.8 million, or 76.6%, to $37.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu segment decreased 934 units, or 74.5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity and elevated dealer channel inventory levels during the period and increased promotional costs, partially offset by lower dealer flooring program costs.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased $57.7 million, or 44.9%, to $71.0 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Unit volumes decreased 370 units, or 51.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Cobalt segment decreased $33.1 million, or 39.7%, to $50.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to Cobalt decreased 201 units, or 35.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nOverall consolidated net sales per unit increased 4.0% to $151,878 per unit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. Net sales per unit for our Malibu segment decreased 8.0% to $117,690 per unit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by increased promotional costs and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Net sales per unit for our Saltwater Fishing segment increased 12.5% to $199,331 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased promotional costs and dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment decreased 7.0% to $135,695 per unit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by an unfavorable model mix, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $123.6 million, or 45.8%, to $146.2 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 59.0% decrease in volumes and partially offset by increasingly normalized inflationary pressures. In the Malibu segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $8.4 million driven by increased prices due to inflationary pressures, offset by a decrease in volume. In the Saltwater Fishing segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $8.2 million driven by increased prices due to inflationary pressures and an increased mix of larger models that corresponded with higher net sales per unit, offset by a decrease in volume. In the Cobalt segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $1.8 million driven by increased prices due to inflationary pressures, partially offset by an increased mix of smaller models that correspond to a lower net sales per unit.\n\nGross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $90.0 million, or 87.8%, to $12.5 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by lower sales revenue. Gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 1,960 basis points from 27.5% to 7.9%, driven by increased promotional costs across all segments, decreased mix of Malibu and Axis models that carry a higher gross margin and fixed-cost deleveraging.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $0.6 million, or 10.6%, to $4.9 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in compensation and boat show and related events for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses increased 160 basis points to 3.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased $96.4 million, or 81.7%, to $21.6 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by the settlement of product liability cases for $100.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023, partially offset by an increase in compensation and personnel-related expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased 1,810 basis points to 13.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, almost entirely due to the settlement of product liability cases discussed above. Amortization expense remained flat at $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nOperating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased to $24.4 million from an operating loss of $22.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased 8.6% to a net loss of $19.6 million from a net loss of $18.0 million and net loss margin increased to (12.3)% from (4.9)% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 104.5% to $(4.1) million from $90.1 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to (2.6)% from 24.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Comparison of the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023**\n\nNet sales for fiscal year 2024 decreased $559.3 million, or 40.3%, to $829.0 million, compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased unit volumes across all segments resulting primarily from decreased wholesale shipments and increased promotional costs across all segments resulting from elevated channel inventory levels and increased flooring costs for the Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt segments, partially offset by a favorable model mix in our Saltwater Fishing segment and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Unit volume for fiscal year 2024 decreased 4,478 units, or 45.4%, to 5,385 units compared to fiscal year 2023. Our unit volume decreased primarily due to lower wholesale shipments across all segments. The decrease in wholesale shipments were driven by our efforts to address elevated channel inventory resulting from weakening retail demand experienced throughout the fiscal year.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Malibu segment decreased $357.1 million, or 56.1%, to $279.1 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu segment decreased 2,946 units for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period, increased promotional costs and elevated dealer channel inventory levels.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased $121.6 million, or 27.1%, to $327.5 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Unit volumes decreased 952 units for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Cobalt segment decreased $80.6 million, or 26.6%, to $222.4 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Unit volumes attributable to Cobalt decreased 580 units for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a decrease in units, increased dealer flooring program costs and unfavorable model mix, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nOverall consolidated net sales per unit increased 9.4% to $153,953 per unit for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Net sales per unit for our Malibu segment increased 3.1% to $127,983 per unit for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, driven by an increased mix of higher optioned boats and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased promotional costs and increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Saltwater Fishing segment increased 15.4% to $200,577 per unit for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, driven by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased promotional activities and increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment increased 0.5% to $141,542 per unit for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, driven by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased promotional activities, unfavorable model mix, and increased dealer flooring program costs.\n\nCost of sales for fiscal year 2024 decreased $355.1 million, or 34.2%, to $681.9 million compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 45.4% decrease in volumes and partially offset by increasingly normalized inflationary pressures. In the Malibu segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $24.3 million driven by an increased mix of larger models that corresponded with higher net sales per unit, fixed-cost deleveraging due to lower volumes and increased prices due to inflationary pressures. In the Saltwater Fishing segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $31.7 million driven by an increased mix of larger models that corresponded with higher net sales per unit, fixed-cost deleveraging due to lower volumes and increased prices due to inflationary pressures. In the Cobalt segment, per unit material and labor costs increased $5.8 million driven by fixed-cost deleveraging due to lower volumes and increased prices due to inflationary pressures.\n\nGross profit for fiscal year 2024 decreased $204.2 million, or 58.1%, compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by lower sales revenue along with fixed-cost deleveraging. Gross margin for fiscal year 2024 decreased 760 basis points from 25.3% to 17.7% driven primarily by an increased mix of the Saltwater Fishing segment and increased dealer flooring program costs.\n\nSelling and marketing expense for fiscal year 2024 decreased $1.2 million, or 5.1% to $22.8 million compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease related to boat show and related events. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expense increased 100 basis points to 2.7% for fiscal year 2024 compared to 1.7% for fiscal year 2023. General and administrative expense for fiscal year 2024 decreased $99.4 million, or 56.6%, to $76.3 million compared to fiscal year 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the $100.0 million settlement of product liability cases in June 2023. Additionally, there was a decrease in compensation and personnel-related expenses partially offset by increases in legal and professional fees, licenses and permits, and IT infrastructure expenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 9.2% for fiscal year 2024 compared to 12.7% for fiscal year 2023. Amortization expense for fiscal year 2024 remained flat at $6.8 million.\n\nOperating (loss) income for fiscal year 2024 decreased to a loss of $55.9 million from $144.8 million for fiscal year 2023. Net (loss) income for fiscal year 2024 decreased 152.3% to a loss of $56.4 million from $107.9 million and net (loss) income margin decreased to (6.8)% for fiscal year 2024 from 7.8% for fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024 decreased 71.0% to $82.2 million from $284.0 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 9.9% for fiscal year 2024 from 20.5% for fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Guidance**\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Malibu anticipates net sales increase percentage in the low single digits year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA margin ranging from 10%-12%.\n\nThe Company has not provided reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA margin, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include acquisition and integration related expenses, costs related to the Company’s vertical integration initiatives and litigation expenses that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** The Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results on Thursday, August 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an indicator of our liquidity. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense, abandonment of construction in process, litigation settlements, certain professional fees, non-cash compensation expense and adjustments to our tax receivable agreement liability. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assist in highlighting trends in our operating results without regard to our financing methods, capital structure and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.\n\nCertain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\n\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income as net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income (benefit) tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the \"LLC\"), and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax (benefit) expense on fully distributed net (loss) income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc., before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and the numerator and denominator for our net income available to Class A Common Stock per share to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income per share of Class A Common Stock is provided under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).

Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation (and we expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or supplement any forward-looking statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events, whether because of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Comparison of results for current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\n\n**Investor Contacts**\n\n**Malibu Boats, Inc.** Bruce BeckmanChief Financial Officer(865) 458-5478InvestorRelations@MalibuBoats.com\n\n**MALIBU BOATS, INC.

Boasting stunning new aesthetics, the new hull is deeper, making space for more ballast and under-seat storage, while allowing passengers to sit deeper in the boat. In combination with the 25 LSV’s elegant, classic bow up front, passengers are shielded from spray during windy, choppy conditions, ensuring an overall smoother, more comfortable ride. And the comfort doesn’t end there.\n\nThe boat’s 25-foot deck features ample comfortable lounge seating, offering expansive seating capacity for up to eighteen people. In the bow, Malibu’s innovative optional Natalie Seat™ creates a third seat with a comfortable backrest, ensuring that three adults can be comfortably accommodated in the bow while also acting as a wind dam for the cockpit.\n\nThe seating on the 25 LSV doubles up as storage, with conveniently hinged seats revealing large deep storage areas below for boards and other gear.\n\nWhen it’s time to take a break from the surf action, the 25 LSV becomes the perfect floating social platform. With plenty of seating for everyone onboard, there’s space for everyone to soak up the sun in comfort, and thanks to Malibu’s newest seating innovations, on-water parties are taken to a whole new level of relaxation. A special highlight is Malibu’s optional Max-Relax Sundeck Loungers™. Located at the transom, these loungers create a premium social zone, where they double as backrests for the rear seats or transform into plush lounge seats when flipped up towards the interior lounge. Cup holders are always within arm’s reach of these and all of the other seats on board.\n\nMalibu’s innovations continue with the optional Max Pivot Seat™. To create the ultimate social atmosphere, the Max Pivot Seat transforms in seconds, converting the wraparound lounge from a standard bench seat to a picnic table, or into a rear-facing seat with a backrest, or even into a sun bed. It’s even possible to quickly and easily remove the filler cushion when not needed, to create an unobstructed Soft Grip path between the swim platform and the lounge. This way nobody has to step on the upholstery or vinyl.\n\nThe new 25 LSV is designed to ensure an unforgettable rider experience and that begins with Malibu’s industry-leading optional G10+ Tower®. First introduced on 2024 models, the G10+ Tower is packed with an exciting array of technology and features designed to make both the rider and everyone’s experience on board unforgettable. Built-in RGB lighting can be controlled from the helm to create a personalized mood on board, while overhead lights illuminate the lounge as you stow your gear at the end of the day. Tower misters are also included, ensuring everyone is cooled down even on the hottest days. The G10+ boasts Malibu’s fully electric Power Tower feature, ensuring that it can be quickly folded down with the turn of a dial, allowing the boat to effortlessly pass under bridges and other obstacles.\n\nWakes and waves are crisp, clean, and reliable even in challenging water conditions thanks to model-specific ballast placement and a proven running surface. Wakes and waves are also customizable with Power Wedge® III to be anything from gradual and forgiving for beginners to steep and aggressive for advanced riders. Waves can be customized from the Malibu Command Center™ or from the rider's wrist while they surf with Surf Band®. Malibu's revolutionary Surf Gate® produces a wave on either side of the boat at the touch of a button while keeping the boat evenly weighted, and can switch from side to side quickly enough to allow the surfer to transfer from one side to the other without stopping the boat.\n\nThe all-new Malibu Wakesetter 25 LSV combines next-level style, luxury, and technology, setting a new benchmark in the watersports industry. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer, the 2025 25 LSV offers an unrivaled on-water experience, making it the ultimate choice for watersports enthusiasts.\n\n**2025 Malibu Command Center™**\n\nThe helm of all 2025 Malibu models will now feature the all-new Malibu Command Center™ that is set to define the next generation of Malibu user experience. Housed in an entirely new, sleeker dashboard design, the new Command Center boasts an ultra-high-pixel-density, low-profile touchscreen display that is brighter and more detailed than our previous design, offering ideal visibility in direct sunlight or in the lowest of light. The ultra-wide touchscreen display now spans 15.8”, delivering immersive viewing without compromising the captain’s forward line of sight. The secondary 8” touchscreen display houses deeper functionality to customize the lounge of your Malibu including music, lighting, and settings.\n\nBoth screens deliver visually stunning new animated graphics thanks to a new, faster processor. Both have been engineered for the demanding marine environment, benefitting from the security and reliability of IP67-rated waterproofing. But the innovations don’t stop there.\n\n**New Operating System**\n\nEvery boat in the 2025 Malibu Boats model line-up will also feature Malibu’s brand-new Operating System that is faster, more robust, and easier to use than ever before. The all-new mOS features customizable graphics themes with driver and rider profiles that deliver a new, more immersive experience for everyone on board. The Operating System’s best-in-class graphics crisply display all of the boat’s key information, with unmatched functionality allowing the user to easily control everything from interior lighting and instrument gauges to Malibu’s legendary Surf Gate® and Power Wedge® III systems. With the simple press of a button, pre-loaded model-specific, customizable watersports presets can be accessed, instantly ready to generate world-class wakes and waves, ensuring memorable adventures for any skill level. And to ensure that every day out on the water ends where it began, navigation is now included in the Command Center as standard.\n\n**New Dashboard**\n\nThe new Command Center is equally as impressive. A freshly introduced steering wheel takes center stage in front of the Command Center. Sleek and newly contoured, the steering wheel has been ergonomically designed to ensure that the captain can drive the boat in total comfort and style, all day long. The redesigned phone holder boasts dual-coil ultra-fast wireless charging and single-handed operation, ensuring that your phone is easily accessible and ready to capture all of the action onboard.\n\n**New Rev 12 Tower Speakers**\n\nAll-new for 2025, Malibu now offers Wet Sounds Rev 12 Tower Speakers with multi-sync RGB lighting, bringing unprecedented volume and sound quality to your on-water experience. Buyers can also select from a comprehensive non-metallic color selection on the speaker and tower, ensuring a customizable tower design that matches their boat exterior.\n\n**AIS Ballast Flush System**\n\nIntroducing another industry first, Malibu Boats is now the only wakeboat company to offer an advanced, convenient Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) ballast flush system upgrade option on all 2025 Malibu models. The user simply connects a fresh water line to a single flush connection located at the transom and, at the press of a button on the Command Center, the AIS system automatically flushes every part of the hard tank ballast system, from seacock to thru-hull, ensuring a complete flush of the system every time, with minimal user effort.\n\nAn optional AIS/Salt Rinse Kit is also now available with every new Malibu trailer, further simplifying the Malibu boat ownership experience.\n\n**All-New Hi-Def Boat Builder**\n\nAlongside the rollout of these masterful innovations and technologies, Malibu Boats announces the launch of its new online consumer boat builder tool. This advanced new tool has been built from the ground up as a showcase of the vast customizability of Malibu Boats, brilliantly empowering users to build the boat of their dreams. The new boat builder tool is set to transform the industry’s conventional boat builder resources by offering easy to use control over the interior, exterior, and included features of their boat.\n\n**About Malibu Boats, Inc.**\n\nBased in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc.

There is also a secondary full-size aft berth and a private head with creature comforts.\n\nThe bridge deck on the new OS 325 has an updated flow which moves the cabin entrance to the center of the boat allowing passengers to easily move through the bridge deck and enter the cabin. The port side cockpit entertainment center includes a grill with a large sink and folding faucet with a removable cover for additional working space as well as clever storage.\n\nAt the helm, all the controls and navigation equipment are ergonomically engineered to provide the captain the ability to operate with confidence. Factory- installed Garmin electronics are standard and include twin 16\" screens. This, combined with the optional Yamaha Helm Master EX Full Maneuverability package offers ease of navigation. Afold-down step gives extra height when needed or acts a s a footrest while seated.\n\nThe cockpit is wide open and easy to maintain with thoughtful seating that creates a lounge area for dining with seats that fold-away easily to allow ample space for angling.

Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nLOUDON, Tenn., May 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Malibu Boats, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBUU) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Highlights Compared to Third Quarter Fiscal 2023****:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 45.8% to $203.4 million\n  * Unit volume decreased 51.9% to 1,269 units\n  * Gross profit decreased 59.1% to $40.3 million\n  * GAAP net income decreased 226.8% to a net loss of $67.8 million, inclusive of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $88.4 million incurred for the Maverick Boat Group reporting unit\n  * GAAP net income available to Class A Common Stock per share (diluted) decreased 230.7% to a net loss of $3.28 per share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 69.2% to $24.4 million\n  * Adjusted fully distributed net income per share decreased 75.7% to $0.63 per share on a fully distributed weighted-average share count of 21.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock\n\n\n\n“In the fiscal third quarter, we continued to navigate a softened retail demand environment, with notable weakness in the tow boat and value boat markets. Despite this challenge, we are encouraged by pockets of strength we are seeing across Cobalt and Pursuit, showcasing resiliency within certain segments of our portfolio,” commented Jack Springer, Chief Executive Officer of Malibu Boats, Inc. “Our channel inventories, which remain elevated, are showing signs of improvement as we enter the peak selling season, with a gradual decline underway. As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus remains on returning inventories to more normalized levels through production reductions and the delivery of boats in the selling season. We anticipate that these efforts will position us for long-term stability and growth.”\n\n“Moving forward, we expect there to be a continued softening in retail demand for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Despite this, we have established a strong foundation and ability to generate positive cash and are poised to support market growth as things correct. We remain confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategy, particularly in a normalized cycle where we see ample opportunity to thrive. Anchored by our three pillars of success – product, production, and distribution – we stand ready to excel. With our industry-leading innovation driving our premium product portfolio, an expanded production footprint, and a robust dealer distribution network, we believe we are primed to capture greater market share and drive profitable growth for our shareholders,” continued Mr. Springer.\n\n**Third****Quarter Fiscal****2024****Results (Unaudited)**\n\n**Three Months Ended March 31,**| **Nine Months Ended March 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n(Dollars In Thousands)  \nNet Sales| $| 203,419| $| 375,119| $| 670,323| $| 1,016,062  \nGross Profit| $| 40,333| $| 98,574| $| 134,602| $| 248,833  \nGross Profit Margin| 19.8|  %| 26.3|  %| 20.1|  %| 24.5|  %  \nNet (Loss) Income| $| (67,759| )| $| 53,452| $| (36,845| )| $| 125,953  \nNet (Loss) Income Margin| (33.3| )%| 14.2|  %| (5.5| )%| 12.4|  %  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 24,409| $| 79,267| $| 86,327| $| 193,937  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 12.0|  %| 21.1|  %| 12.9|  %| 19.1|  %  \n  \nNet sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $171.7 million, or 45.8%, to $203.4 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased unit volumes across all segments resulting primarily from decreased wholesale shipments and increased dealer flooring program costs across all segments resulting from higher interest rates and elevated channel inventory levels, partially offset by a favorable model mix in our Saltwater Fishing segment and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Unit volume for the three months ended March 31, 2024, decreased 1,368 units, or 51.9%, to 1,269 units as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our unit volume decreased primarily due to lower wholesale shipments across all segments driven by lower retail activity and elevated channel inventories during the period.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Malibu segment decreased $112.4 million, or 65.1%, to $60.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu segment decreased 886 units for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and elevated dealer channel inventory levels. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased $41.4 million, or 33.8%, to $81.2 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Unit volume decreased 337 units for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and elevated dealer channel inventory levels. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Cobalt segment decreased $17.9 million, or 22.4%, to $62.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Unit volumes attributable to Cobalt decreased 145 units for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and elevated dealer channel inventory levels. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nOverall consolidated net sales per unit increased 12.7% to $160,299 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net sales per unit for our Malibu segment increased 3.3% to $133,173 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Saltwater Fishing segment increased 24.8% to $213,184 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 driven by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment increased 3.4% to $142,206 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs.\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $113.5 million, or 41.0%, to $163.1 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 45.8% decrease in net sales due to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher per unit material and labor costs of $4.8 million, $9.5 million and $2.0 million for the Malibu, Saltwater Fishing, and Cobalt segments, respectively. The increase in per unit material and labor costs was primarily driven by increased prices due to inflationary pressures, fixed cost deleverage and a model mix that corresponds to higher cost per unit in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments.\n\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $58.2 million, or 59.1%, to $40.3 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by lower net sales partially offset by decreased cost of sales for the reasons noted above. Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 650 basis points from 26.3% to 19.8% driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage due to lower sales, an increased mix of the Saltwater Fishing segment, and increased dealer flooring program costs.\n\nWe recognized an impairment charge of $88.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 related to our Maverick Boat Group reporting unit. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we determined certain indicators of impairment existed, including a decline, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 forecasts, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our business plan and a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates and inflationary pressures on labor and supply costs. Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $0.6 million, or 8.7% to $6.6 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in travel and marketing events. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses increased 130 basis points to 3.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 1.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $0.8 million, or 4.4%, to $18.6 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 driven primarily by a decrease in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by increased information technology cost. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased 390 basis points to 9.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 5.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Amortization expense remained flat at $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nOperating (loss) income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to an operating loss of $74.9 million from an operating income $70.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net (loss) income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 226.8% to a net loss of $(67.8) million from net income of $53.5 million and net (loss) income margin decreased to (33.3)% from 14.2% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 69.2% to $24.4 million from $79.3 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 12.0% from 21.1% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Malibu anticipates net sales decline ranging from forty to forty-one percent, year-over-year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin ranging from 10.1% to 10.5%.\n\nThe Company has not provided reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA margin, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include costs related to the Company’s vertical integration initiatives that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss third quarter of fiscal year 2024 results on Thursday, May 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Investors and analysts can participate on the conference call by dialing (844) 695-5523 or (412) 317-0699 and requesting Malibu Boats.

These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an indicator of our liquidity. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees and non-cash compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net (loss) income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assist in highlighting trends in our operating results without regard to our financing methods, capital structure, and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net (loss) income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.\n\nCertain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\n\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income as net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the \"LLC\"), and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed net (loss) income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net (loss) income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc., before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net (loss) income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of our net (loss) income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and the numerator and denominator for our net (loss) income available to Class A Common Stock per share to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net (Loss) Income per share of Class A Common Stock is provided under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).

(Nasdaq: MBUU) (“Malibu” or the “Company”) today issued the following statement in connection with a lawsuit filed by Tommy’s Boats (“Tommy’s”) and its related parties in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on April 10, 2024:\n\n“The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by Tommy’s. Tommy’s was formerly a longtime dealer partner of ours, and we ended our relationship due to concerns about Tommy’s own conduct and its financial soundness. Indeed, Tommy’s lender is also suing it for violating the agreements Tommy’s used to finance the purchase of our boats. We will always act to protect our business, our customers and our shareholders.\n\nAs such, we believe it is important to clarify the following points:\n\n  * **Any and all boats that Malibu sold to Tommy’s were**** _ordered_****by Tommy’s.** Malibu only sold boats to Tommy’s that Tommy’s ordered, and Malibu fulfilled its obligations under its agreements with Tommy’s. We value our relationships with our dealer partners, and we live up to our agreements.\n  * **Malibu took action in light of Tommy’s sales of boats out of trust**. In the fall of 2023, Malibu first became aware that Tommy’s was selling boats out of trust (selling boats that were bank collateral and not reporting the sales to the bank or repaying the bank). Upon learning that Tommy’s was selling out of trust, Malibu engaged with Tommy’s and M&T Bank, on numerous occasions, regarding Tommy’s financial position and potential paths forward. Those discussions did not result in a resolution that we believed was in the best interest of our shareholders, dealer partners and end-customers, and we therefore ended our relationship with Tommy’s. We do not currently have any dealership agreements in effect with Tommy’s.\n  * **Tommy’s is already mired in litigation over its default on its lending agreements**. Earlier this month and in response to, among other things, Tommy’s conduct in selling boats out of trust, M&T Bank sued Tommy’s for breach of its lending agreement. M&T has filed a motion to appoint a receiver over the assets of Tommy’s.\n  * **Malibu is working to mitigate any disruption for our partners and customers – as well as our business.** We have been working with our dealership network and are in discussions with strong dealer partners to limit any service gaps in markets previously served by Tommy’s. We remain committed to serving Malibu’s end-users in all our markets.”\n\n\n\n**About Malibu Boats, Inc.** Based in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc. (MBUU) is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats, including performance sport, sterndrive and outboard boats. Malibu Boats, Inc. is the market leader in the performance sport boat category through its Malibu and Axis boat brands, the leader in the 20’ - 40’ segment of the sterndrive boat category through its Cobalt brand, and in a leading position in the saltwater fishing boat market with its Pursuit and Cobia offshore boats and Pathfinder, Maverick, and Hewes flats and bay boat brands.

Pierce, FL, February 28, 2024 – The Pursuit Boats booths were abuzz at the 2024 Miami International Boat Show. Their newest model, the DC 306 Dual Console, proved to be a big draw and was on display both in their in-water and convention center locations. The DC 306 is the latest addition to Pursuit’s innovative and award- winning dual console family and builds on the reputation of one of its most popular boats, the DC 295. With an LOA of 31 feet 11 inches, the DC 306 incorporates the recognizable aesthetic and profile of the dual console lineup.\n\nFeaturing an innovative fully integrated fiberglass hardtop with tempered glass windshield and the signature walkthrough door, both captain and crew can be fully protected from the elements. The windows port and starboard are manufactured to deliver an unparalleled running experience with unobstructed views and crystal- clear visibility. When the center window is closed and secured, the bridge deck is dry and wind free, a hallmark of the dual console design from Pursuit.\n\nThe ample and versatile seating throughout the vessel features Pursuit’s signature upholstery with rich accents and detailed stitching. At the helm, all the controls and navigation equipment are ergonomically engineered to provide the captainthe ability to operate with confidence. No detail is overlooked in the placement of Yamaha gauges, ignitions and standard dual 12\" Garmin displays. Teak accents around the helm add warmth and style. Expect the DC 306 to cruise at 28.5 MPH while turning 3500 RPMs rigged with standard power, twin Yamaha F 300s with built-in Digital Electric Steering.\n\nAs with all Pursuit’s this DC was engineered to fish. The wide-open cockpit boasts all the amenities needed for a great day on the water, including a 26-gallon live well, large in-floor fishboxes and plenty of storage for rods, lures and accessories. There are eight standard rod holders, and the aft-facing seat provides multiple opportunities for tackle storage including a designated area behind the seatback.\n\nThis model does not lack for storage. With dedicated areas for two tables, ample space within the bow seats, fully equipped entertainment center with thoughtful accommodations and even a storage drawer below the captain’s chair. To the portside, there is a lockable fiberglass compartment door to reveal a massive storage area that reaches all the way to the bow floor. Gloveboxes, cupholders and a full head, complete with Pursuit’s patented entry door, offers all the amenities guests will need for a comfortable and fun day on the water. A standard hull side door makes it easy to slide a large fish on deck or enter the cockpit from the water after a dive.\n\n“When you step aboard the DC 306 you will discover why we refer to our dual consoles as our sport utility boats—they really can do it all thanks to extensive fishing and entertaining amenities,” said Chris Gratz Senior Vice President of Operationsand Engineering. “We design our boats with the customer in mind. We want them to embrace the Pure Pursuit experience.”\n\nTo fully understand all the features, standards and options the DC 306 offers, you need to experience it for yourself. To schedule a sea trial, contact your factory authorized Pursuit Boats dealer, or visit pursuitboats.com to learn more.\n\nAbout Pursuit Boats\n\nFor nearly half a century, Pursuit Boats has been building high-quality, luxury offshore fishing boats using distinct engineering and production processes championed by the Pursuit family of employees.

Announces Leadership Changes\n\nFebruary 20, 2024\n\n_Jack Springer will depart as Chief Executive Officer in May 2024;_ _Ritchie Anderson appointed to President;_ _Michael Hooks appointed to Executive Chair_\n\nLOUDON, Tenn., Feb. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Malibu Boats, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBUU) announced today that Jack Springer will be departing as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) on or before May 17, 2024.\n\nThe Company also announced today that Ritchie Anderson, the Company’s current Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), has been promoted to President, effective immediately. Michael Hooks, Malibu’s current Chair, will assume the role of Executive Chair, effective immediately, until a new CEO is announced.\n\n“For more than 15 years, I have had the honor of serving as Malibu’s CEO. During that time, we have experienced explosive growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. We have also acquired five companies, including the addition of three premium brands – Cobalt, Pursuit and Maverick Boats – to become one of the largest producers of fiberglass power boats in the world,” commented Jack Springer, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Malibu Boats Inc.\n\n“With all of our success, the greatest accomplishment has been the team we have amassed at Malibu from our leadership to our production line and every person in between. We have held each other accountable and demanded excellence from one another, and for that, I am deeply grateful and proud. We have been, and will continue to be, recognized for our culture of cutting-edge innovation and operational excellence that is executed with pride and passion. I will hold close the relationships I formed during my time at the Company from our employees to dealers and suppliers to our investors and analysts. I have every confidence that Malibu will continue to grow, be better, and be stronger, as I continue to cheer this team on from the sidelines,” concluded Mr. Springer.\n\nMr. Springer will resign as a Director of Malibu’s Board of Directors upon his departure as CEO. If a new CEO has not been appointed at the time of Mr. Springer’s departure, an interim Office of the CEO, including Mr. Anderson and Mr. Hooks, has been established and will assume the role of CEO.\n\nMr. Anderson has over 41 years of experience in the marine industry and has served as the Company’s COO since 2013, after joining Malibu in 2011. Mr. Hooks has been a member of the Company’s board since 2006. He was a co-founder of Black Canyon Capital LLC, which acquired the assets of Malibu from its founder in 2006.\n\n“On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Jack for his countless efforts over the last 15 years, and we wish him well in his next chapter. During his tenure, Jack’s vision and operational leadership have been integral to growing Malibu Boats into the powerhouse it is today. Through a steadfast commitment to innovation, operational excellence and vertical integration, the Company is positioned to enter its next phase of growth poised for further value creation,” commented Michael K. Hooks, Chair of Malibu Boats’ Board of Directors.\n\n“Malibu has a talented and deep leadership team, which will be further bolstered by the appointment of Ritchie to President. I am thrilled to announce this promotion, which reflects Ritchie’s continued leadership and contributions to Malibu and this team,” continued Mr. Hooks. “The Board will run a comprehensive search for its next CEO, considering both internal and external candidates. In the interim, I look forward to working more closely with Ritchie and the entire Malibu team to ensure a seamless transition as we maintain our track record of delivering the most innovative, highest quality boats in the marine industry.”\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company today reaffirmed its fiscal year 2024 guidance that it provided on January 30, 2024, as part of its second fiscal quarter earnings release.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Malibu anticipates net sales decline ranging from the mid-to-high thirties percentage, year-over-year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin down 800 to 900 basis points, year-over-year.\n\n**About Malibu Boats, Inc.**\n\nBased in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc. (MBUU) is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a diverse range of recreational powerboats, including performance sport, sterndrive and outboard boats. Malibu Boats, Inc. is the market leader in the performance sport boat category through its Malibu and Axis boat brands, the leader in the 20’ - 40’ segment of the sterndrive boat category through its Cobalt brand, and in a leading position in the saltwater fishing boat market with its Pursuit and Cobia offshore boats and Pathfinder, Maverick, and Hewes flats and bay boat brands. A pre-eminent innovator in the powerboat industry, Malibu Boats, Inc. designs products that appeal to an expanding range of recreational boaters, fisherman and water sports enthusiasts whose passion for boating is a key component of their active lifestyles.

This measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The use of this non-GAAP measure should also not be construed as an inference that the Company’s results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees and non-cash compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin allow investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare its results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA margin to assist in highlighting trends in the Company’s operating results without regard to its financing methods, capital structure, and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company’s industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\n\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of guidance to net income margin for Adjusted EBITDA margin, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop net income for fiscal year 2024. These items include costs related to the Company’s vertical integration initiatives that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an estimate of net income.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes statements in this press release regarding the Company’s guidance for net sales and Adjusted EBITDA margin, future changes in the Company’s management team and the Company’s ability to grow and create value. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: general industry, economic and business conditions; the Company’s large fixed cost base; increases in the cost of, or unavailability of, raw materials, component parts and transportation costs; disruptions in the Company’s suppliers’ operations; the Company’s reliance on third-party suppliers for raw materials and components and any interruption of the Company’s informal supply arrangements; the Company’s reliance on certain suppliers for our engines and outboard motors; the Company’s ability to meet its manufacturing workforce needs; the Company’s ability to grow its business through acquisitions and integrate such acquisitions to fully realize their expected benefits; the Company’s growth strategy which may require it to secure significant additional capital; the Company’s ability to protect its intellectual property; disruptions to the Company’s network and information systems; risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions; a natural disaster, global pandemic or other disruption at the Company’s manufacturing facilities; increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws; the Company’s dependence on key personnel; the Company’s ability to enhance existing products and market new or enhanced products; the continued strength of the Company’s brands; the seasonality of the Company’s business; intense competition within the Company’s industry; increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand; competition with other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time; changes in currency exchange rates; inflation and increases in interest rates; an increase in energy and fuel costs; the Company’s reliance on its network of independent dealers and increasing competition for dealers; the financial health of the Company’s dealers and their continued access to financing; the Company’s obligation to repurchase inventory of certain dealers; the Company’s exposure to claims for product liability and warranty claims; any failure to comply with laws and regulations including environmental, workplace safety and other regulatory requirements; the Company’s variable rate indebtedness which subjects it to interest rate risk; the Company’s obligation to make certain payments under a tax receivables agreement; and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside the Company’s control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which the Company does not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation (and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or supplement any forward-looking statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events, whether because of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.\n\n**Contacts**\n\nMalibu Boats, Inc.InvestorRelations@MalibuBoats.com\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTAzOTU4MyM2MDc3MzI2IzIwMDg0OTM=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YjU4ODFhYjktZjM4MS00ZTk5LTlhOTYtMDIwNTgwZDllMzk4LTEwMjAwNjY=/tiny/Malibu-Boats-Inc-.png)\n\n[ ![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/bc53ed7e-c845-40f3-95dd-264a139128ef/small/malibu-png.png) ](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bc53ed7e-c845-40f3-95dd-264a139128ef)\n\nSource: Malibu Boats, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://malibuboatsinc.com/investor-information/earnings-news/default.aspx)\n\n[ ![Malibu Boats Inc.](//s29.q4cdn.com/926843978/files/images/header-logo-1.png) ](/home)\n\n![Malibu Boats brand mark](//s29.q4cdn.com/926843978/files/design/logos/brandmark.png)\n\n### Investors - Contact Us\n\ninvestorrelations@malibuboats.com\n\n### Investors - Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://malibuboatsinc.com/investor-information/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://malibuboatsinc.com/resources/contact-us/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Investors - Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\nLOUDON, Tenn., Jan. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Malibu Boats, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBUU) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Second** **Quarter Fiscal** **2024** **Highlights Compared to** **Second** **Quarter Fiscal** **2023** **:**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 37.7% to $211.1 million\n  * Unit volume decreased 43.7% to 1,373 units\n  * Gross profit decreased 50.5% to $37.5 million\n  * Net income decreased 72.1% to $10.1 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 60.2% to $22.9 million\n  * Net income available to Class A Common Stock per share (diluted) decreased 71.5% to $0.49 per share\n  * Adjusted fully distributed net income per share decreased 68.9% to $0.57 per share on a fully distributed weighted-average share count of 21.1 million shares of Class A Common Stock\n\n\n\n“Our second quarter results, historically our slowest time of the year, were impacted by weak retail demand,” commented Jack Springer, Chief Executive Officer of Malibu Boats, Inc. “We are recalibrating wholesale production to match retail demand as seasonality, along with continued interest rate pressures has resulted in elevated inventory levels. While the current macroeconomic outlook creates uncertainty, we are starting to see some positive signs following our Year End Sales event for Malibu, demonstrating the resiliency of our brands. The upcoming boat show season will serve as an additional indicator of retail recovery, as we believe it will reflect the continuing consumer interest for our larger, feature-rich boats.”\n\n“Looking ahead, while we are optimistic about our ability to return to growth as the market recovers, we will remain lean and nimble. Our operational capabilities, highly variable cost structure and strong team enables Malibu to execute in any choppy environment. These strengths, which we have demonstrated year after year, allow us to continue to be aggressive and continue to invest in the business. As always, we will lead the way as the premier recreational power boat manufacturer as we strive to take advantage of strategic opportunities during down cycles, continue growing our market share, and position ourselves to drive long-term value for our shareholders.” continued Mr. Springer.\n\n**Second** **Quarter Fiscal** **2024** **Results (Unaudited)**\n\n**Three Months Ended December 31,** |  **Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2022**  \n(Dollars In Thousands)  \nNet Sales | $ | 211,074 | $ | 338,732 | $ | 466,904 | $ | 640,943  \nGross Profit | $ | 37,475 | $ | 75,654 | $ | 94,269 | $ | 150,259  \nGross Profit Margin | 17.8 | % | 22.3 | % | 20.2 | % | 23.4 | %  \nNet Income | $ | 10,144 | $ | 36,396 | $ | 30,914 | $ | 72,501  \nNet Income Margin | 4.8 | % | 10.7 | % | 6.6 | % | 11.3 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 22,930 | $ | 57,610 | $ | 61,918 | $ | 114,670  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin | 10.9 | % | 17.0 | % | 13.3 | % | 17.9 | %  \n  \nNet sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $127.7 million, or 37.7%, to $211.1 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased unit volumes across all segments resulting primarily from decreased retail demand and increased dealer flooring program costs across all segments resulting from higher interest rates and increased inventory levels, partially offset by a favorable model mix in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases. Unit volume for the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreased 1,066 units, or 43.7%, to 1,373 units as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our unit volume decreased primarily due to lower wholesale shipments across all segments driven by lower retail activity during the period.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Malibu segment decreased $81.8 million, or 51.7%, to $76.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Unit volumes attributable to our Malibu segment decreased 712 units for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower wholesale shipments driven by lower retail activity during the period and elevated dealer channel inventory levels. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Saltwater Fishing segment decreased $22.9 million, or 21.6%, to $82.7 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Unit volume decreased 188 units for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nNet sales attributable to our Cobalt segment decreased $23.0 million, or 30.7%, to $52.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Unit volumes attributable to Cobalt decreased 166 units for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a decrease in units and increased dealer flooring program costs, partially offset by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases.\n\nOverall consolidated net sales per unit increased 10.7% to $153,732 per unit for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net sales per unit for our Malibu segment increased 5.0% to $126,056 per unit for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Saltwater Fishing segment increased 14.7% to $204,279 per unit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 driven by a favorable model mix and inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs. Net sales per unit for our Cobalt segment increased 1.1% to $143,511 per unit for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven by inflation-driven year-over-year price increases, partially offset by increased dealer flooring program costs and unfavorable model mix.\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $89.5 million, or 34.0%, to $173.6 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 37.7% decrease in net sales due to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher per unit material and labor costs of $4.2 million and $7.0 million for the Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments, respectively. The increase in per unit material and labor costs was primarily driven by increased prices due to inflationary pressures and a model mix that corresponds to higher cost per unit in our Malibu and Saltwater Fishing segments.\n\nGross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $38.2 million, or 50.5%, to $37.5 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by lower net sales partially offset by decreased cost of sales for the reasons noted above. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased 450 basis points from 22.3% to 17.8% driven by fixed cost deleverage due to lower sales, increased mix of the Saltwater Fishing segment and increased dealer flooring program costs.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $0.6 million, or 9.5% to $5.6 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in marketing events. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses increased 90 basis points to 2.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 1.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased $3.6 million, or 19.0%, to $15.4 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 driven primarily by a decrease in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by increased information technology costs and professional fees. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased 170 basis points to 7.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 5.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Amortization expense remained flat at $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOperating income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $14.7 million from $48.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 72.1% to $10.1 million from $36.4 million and net income margin decreased to 4.8% from 10.7% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 60.2% to $22.9 million from $57.6 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 10.9% from 17.0% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Malibu anticipates net sales decline ranging from the mid-to-high thirties percentage, year-over-year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin down 800 to 900 basis points, year-over-year.\n\nThe Company has not provided reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA margin, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include costs related to the Company’s vertical integration initiatives that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results on Tuesday, January 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an indicator of our liquidity. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees and non-cash compensation expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assist in highlighting trends in our operating results without regard to our financing methods, capital structure, and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.\n\nCertain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets.\n\nWe define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the \"LLC\"), and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed net income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc., before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of LLC units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and the numerator and denominator for our net income available to Class A Common Stock per share to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income per share of Class A Common Stock is provided under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\n\n**Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes statements in this press release regarding potential positive retail demand trends from upcoming boat shows, our outlook for the marine industry and broader economy and our ability to continue to deliver value for our stockholders.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: general industry, economic and business conditions; our large fixed cost base; increases in the cost of, or unavailability of, raw materials, component parts and transportation costs; disruptions in our suppliers’ operations; our reliance on third-party suppliers for raw materials and components and any interruption of our informal supply arrangements; our reliance on certain suppliers for our engines and outboard motors; our ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs; exposure to workers' compensation claims and other workplace liabilities; our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and integrate such acquisitions to fully realize their expected benefits; our growth strategy which may require us to secure significant additional capital; our ability to protect our intellectual property; disruptions to our network and information systems; our success at developing and implementing a new enterprise resource planning system; risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions; the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us; a natural disaster, global pandemic or other disruption at our manufacturing facilities; increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws; our dependence on key personnel; our ability to enhance existing products and market new or enhanced products; the continued strength of our brands; the seasonality of our business; intense competition within our industry; increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand; competition with other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time; changes in currency exchange rates; inflation and increases in interest rates; an increase in energy and fuel costs; our reliance on our network of independent dealers and increasing competition for dealers; the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing; our obligation to repurchase inventory of certain dealers; our exposure to claims for product liability and warranty claims; changes to U.S. trade policy, tariffs and import/export regulations; any failure to comply with laws and regulations including environmental, workplace safety and other regulatory requirements; our holding company structure; covenants in our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility which may limit our operating flexibility; our variable rate indebtedness which subjects us to interest rate risk; our obligation to make certain payments under a tax receivables agreement; any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls or procedures; and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

Equipped with many of the core features that have made Axis the fastest-growing watersports towboat brand, the T220-r can produce beginner to advanced wakeboard wakes along with endless surf waves, thanks to Surf Gate®—all for under $89,995*.\n\nAxis T220-r Specifications:\n\n  * Hull Length: 21' 11\" / 6.68m\n  * Max Capacity: 15\n  * Beam: 102\" / 2.59m\n  * Draft: 27\" / 0.69m\n  * Approx. Dry Weight: 4850lbs. / 2200kg\n  * Fuel Capacity: 58 gal / 219.5L\n  * Max Factory Ballast: 1,145lbs. / 519kg\n  * Power Torque: 360HP/400ft–lbs.\n  * Hull Type: Wake Plus™\n\n\n\nThe T220-r shares the same running surface as the T220, the iconic Wake Plus™ hull. This is the legendary running surface that produces symmetrical wakes and waves on every boat in the Axis line. Add hard tank ballast, controlled by a Garmin seven-inch touchscreen, and it makes the T220-r an ideal watersports boat for any level rider from beginner to advanced. Malibu’s Surf Gate—the industry's most awarded surf system—makes a perfect wave on either side of the boat with just a tap on the screen and without having to move any weight from side to side. The T220-r is also equipped with Surf Pipe, which is safer for surfers and quieter for passengers than traditional exhaust systems. And, with inboard propulsion, owners not only get the best wakes and waves, but they can also surf with the peace of mind that the propeller is secured safely under the hull of the boat.\n\nThe T220-r’s outstanding watersports functionality is controlled at the dash with a high-visibility, marine-grade touchscreen. Owners can fill and empty ballast, change the surf side, adjust speed, and much more with an intuitive user interface that’s easy to master within a few minutes. Select rider presets to further simplify the process, picking between your sport of choice, and then selecting from three different levels of wakeboarding or the surf side for surfing. From there, it’s as simple as selecting “load” and the boat takes over, filling ballast to ideal levels, adjusting speed control, and deploying Surf Gate on the selected side. Surfers can even switch from side-to-side while riding thanks to Surf Gate’s fast transition.\n\nThe T220-r’s traditional bow styling provides a sleek profile while easily cutting through chop for a spray-free ride. The seating capacity is impressive at up to 15 people thanks in large part to the clean, wraparound lounge. This uncluttered space provides plenty of options for flexible seating, including rear-facing seating for watching surfing and wakeboarding, or forward-facing seating to run down the lake to a quiet cove for a swim. Under-seat storage provides plenty of space for the crew’s gear on long lake days, and the Wet Sounds audio system with Bluetooth connection keeps the party going the entire time.\n\nThroughout the interior and exterior, the T220-r has signature Axis styling with bold lines that make a statement on the water. The T220-r is powered by the Malibu Monsoon M5Di™ engine, which utilizes automotive direct injection technology along with exclusive Malibu engineering to produce unmatched performance, fuel economy, reliability, and sound reduction.\n\nTo learn more about the all-new Axis T220-r, visit [AxisWake.com](http://AxisWake.com) or contact your local dealer today.\n\n_*Price in USD, for United States & Canada only.

This 21-foot hull is packed with value and boasts many of Malibu’s signature wake and comfort features at a price point of $99,995*. The new model aligns with both non-watersports-specific and watersports-specific competitors’ offerings while raising the standard of wake and wave performance.\n\n2024 Malibu 21 LX-r Specifications\n\n  * Hull Length: 21'/6.40 M\n  * Beam: 98\"/2.49 M\n  * Draft: 27\"/0.69 M\n  * Max Capacity: 12\n  * Approx. Dry Weight: 4,580 LBS/2,077 KG\n  * Weight Capacity: 1,692 LBS/767 KG\n  * Fuel Capacity: 50 GAL/189 L\n  * Max Factory Ballast: 890 LBS/403 KG\n  * Power (Torque): 360 HP/400 FT-LBS\n  * Hull Type: Wake Plus™\n\n\n\nThe 21 LX-r’s watersports performance is built on the rock-solid foundation of the Wake Plus™ hull, which is Malibu’s legendary running surface across all its high-end boats. The Wake Plus hull produces the coveted Malibu wake and wave experience the competition continues to chase year after year. The 21 LX-r wakes feature symmetrical ramps with clean lips that are great for all wakeboarders. Standard on the 21 LX-r is Malibu’s Surf Gate®, the most awarded surf system of all time, allowing a perfect wave on either side of the boat without needing to move any weight from side-to-side. The 21 LX-r produces outstanding power and volume in its ocean-like surf waves for riders of all ages and sizes, and the standard Surf Pipe serves as an important safety feature to divert fumes away from riders behind the boat while reducing engine noise for passengers. With push-button hard tank ballast, the 21 LX-r’s wakes and waves can quickly and easily go from small and approachable for beginners to smooth-yet-powerful for advanced riders.\n\nAll of the 21 LX-r’s watersports potential is unlocked through the Malibu Command Center™ at the dash. This high-visibility dual touchscreen has everything you need to control the boat, monitor vitals, and create perfect days on the water, no matter your experience level. Factory-loaded watersports presets make it as easy as selecting your wakeboard level or surf side, tapping load on the screen, and gearing up to ride. These standard presets on the 21 LX-r automatically fill the ballast to the correct levels, sets the speed, and deploys Surf Gate. You are even able to edit the factory-loaded presets and add specific users to the platform.\n\nThe 21 LX-r has the same layout as the 21 LX, with the functionality of a Hybrid Bow to cut through chop while giving passengers more forward space. With comfortable seating for 12 along with deep, under-seat storage for watersports gear, cup holders, a bimini top, the G5 Tower, and a Wet Sounds audio system, the 21 LX-r has everything you need to make a great day on the water.\n\nThe 21 LX-r is powered by the tough and capable Malibu Monsoon M5Di™. Made onsite at the Malibu headquarters, the M5Di features automotive direct-injection technology along with signature Malibu innovations that produce unmatched performance, fuel economy, reliability, and sound reduction.\n\nTo learn more about the all-new Malibu 21 LX-r, visit [MalibuBoats.com](http://MalibuBoats.com) or contact your local dealer to find your truth on the water.\n\n**About Malibu Boats, Inc.** _Based in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc.
