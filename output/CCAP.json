Unitranche loans are first lien loans that may extend deeper in a company’s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different\nlenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, the Company may find another lender to provide the “first out” portion of such loan and retain the “last out” portion of such loan, in which\ncase, the “first out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last out” portion that the\nCompany would continue to hold.

Our assessment is based on the following categories: (1) Involves the least\namount of risk relative to cost or amortized cost. Investment performance is above expectations since origination or acquisition. Trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may\ninclude financial performance or a potential exit. (2) Involves a level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The investment is generally performing as expected,\nand the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment are neutral to favorable relative to the time of origination or acquisition. New investments are generally assigned a\nrating of 2 at origination or acquisition. (3) Indicates an investment performing below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the investment have\nincreased since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers are more likely than not in compliance with debt covenants and loan payments are generally not past due. An\ninvestment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. (4) Indicates an investment performing materially below expectations where the risks around our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of the\ninvestment have increased materially since origination or acquisition. For debt investments, borrowers may be out of compliance with debt covenants and loan payments may be past due (but\ngenerally not more than 180 days past due).

In certain instances, the Company may find another lender to provide the “first out” portion of such loan and retain the “last out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last out” portion that the Company would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last out” portion earns a higher interest rate.  \n**Crescent Capital BDC, Inc.**Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities****(in thousands except share and per share data)****  \n---  \n**As of****September 30, 2024**| **As of****December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nInvestments, at fair value  \nNon-controlled non-affiliated investments (cost of$1,485,564 and $1,469,251, respectively)| $| 1,492,347| $| 1,465,537  \nNon-controlled affiliated investments (cost of $48,703 and $56,084, respectively)| 51,003| 52,619  \nControlled investments (cost of $66,748 and $67,353, respectively)| 48,083| 63,919  \nCash and cash equivalents| 17,086| 7,780  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| 20,751| 16,690  \nInterest and dividend receivable| 10,640| 14,000  \nReceivable from unsettled transactions| 131| 251  \nUnrealized appreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 1,396| 5,128  \nDeferred tax assets| 503| 114  \nOther assets| 3,109| 1,341  \n**Total assets**|  $| 1,645,049| $| 1,627,379  \n**Liabilities**  \nDebt (net of deferred financing costs of $7,358 and $7,138)| $| 857,236| $| 844,783  \nDistributions payable| 15,566| 15,195  \nInterest and other debt financing costs payable| 9,116| 10,900  \nManagement fees payable| 5,089| 5,026  \nIncentive fees payable| 4,899| 4,770  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 503| 578  \nUnrealized depreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 77| 84  \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities| 3,756| 3,449  \n**Total liabilities**|  $| 896,242| $| 884,785  \n**Net assets**  \nPreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (10,000 shares authorized, zero outstanding, respectively)| $| -| $| -

In certain instances, the Company may find another lender to provide the “first out” portion of such loan and retain the “last out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last out” portion that the Company would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last out” portion earns a higher interest rate.  \n**Crescent Capital BDC, Inc.**Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities****(in thousands except share and per share data)****  \n---  \n**As of****September 30, 2024**| **As of****December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nInvestments, at fair value  \nNon-controlled non-affiliated investments (cost of$1,485,564 and $1,469,251, respectively)| $| 1,492,347| $| 1,465,537  \nNon-controlled affiliated investments (cost of $48,703 and $56,084, respectively)| 51,003| 52,619  \nControlled investments (cost of $66,748 and $67,353, respectively)| 48,083| 63,919  \nCash and cash equivalents| 17,086| 7,780  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| 20,751| 16,690  \nInterest and dividend receivable| 10,640| 14,000  \nReceivable from unsettled transactions| 131| 251  \nUnrealized appreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 1,396| 5,128  \nDeferred tax assets| 503| 114  \nOther assets| 3,109| 1,341  \n**Total assets**|  $| 1,645,049| $| 1,627,379  \n**Liabilities**  \nDebt (net of deferred financing costs of $7,358 and $7,138)| $| 857,236| $| 844,783  \nDistributions payable| 15,566| 15,195  \nInterest and other debt financing costs payable| 9,116| 10,900  \nManagement fees payable| 5,089| 5,026  \nIncentive fees payable| 4,899| 4,770  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 503| 578  \nUnrealized depreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 77| 84  \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities| 3,756| 3,449  \n**Total liabilities**|  $| 896,242| $| 884,785  \n**Net assets**  \nPreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (10,000 shares authorized, zero outstanding, respectively)| $| -| $| -

The increase in investment income was largely the result of net funding activity and an increase in reference rates. Net expenses, including income and excise taxes, totaled $27.2 million and $26.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net expenses was primarily due to an increase in reference rates which increased the Company's weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $36.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and $293.8 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average cost of debt on the Company’s debt outstanding as of June 30, 2024 was 7.26%.\n\nThe Company’s debt to equity ratio was 1.18x as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast/conference call on Tuesday, August 13, 2024 at 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

In certain instances, the Company may find another lender to provide the “first out” portion of such loan and retain the “last out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last out” portion that the Company would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last out” portion earns a higher interest rate.\n\n**Crescent Capital BDC, Inc.**Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities****(in thousands except share and per share data)****  \n---  \n**As of****June 30, 2024**| **As of****December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nInvestments, at fair value  \nNon-controlled non-affiliated investments (cost of$1,493,976 and $1,469,251, respectively)| $| 1,501,420| $| 1,465,537  \nNon-controlled affiliated investments (cost of $54,294 and $56,084, respectively)| 52,023| 52,619  \nControlled investments (cost of $64,619 and $67,353, respectively)| 57,332| 63,919  \nCash and cash equivalents| 11,018| 7,780  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| 25,124| 16,690  \nInterest and dividend receivable| 16,089| 14,000  \nReceivable from unsettled transactions| 2,549| 251  \nUnrealized appreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 2,765| 5,128  \nDeferred tax assets| 939| 114  \nOther assets| 3,173| 1,341  \n**Total assets**|  $| 1,672,432| $| 1,627,379  \n**Liabilities**  \nDebt (net of deferred financing costs of $7,903 and $7,138)| $| 879,934| $| 844,783  \nDistributions payable| 15,566| 15,195  \nInterest and other debt financing costs payable| 11,038| 10,900  \nManagement fees payable| 5,001| 5,026  \nIncentive fees payable| 4,603| 4,770  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 883| 578  \nUnrealized depreciation on foreign currency forward contracts| 42| 84  \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities| 2,925| 3,449  \n**Total liabilities**|  $| 919,992| $| 884,785  \n**Net assets**  \nPreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (10,000 shares authorized, zero outstanding, respectively)| $| -| $| -
