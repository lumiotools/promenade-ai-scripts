Yet its\neffectiveness remains unclear, and it is recommended for early-stage Alzheimer’s (BioMed Central).\n• Lecanemab (Leqembi): Approved in 2023, this monoclonal antibody also targets amyloid plaques and\nhas shown modest efficacy in slowing cognitive decline despite marked reductions in amyloid\nburden (MedPage Today).\n• Donanemab (Kisunla): Approved in 2024, it has demonstrated significant yet modest slowing of\ndisease progression, especially if administered early in the disease (BrightFocus).\n• Current DMTs are associated with safety risks due to the occurrence of brain hemorrhages and/or rain\nswelling in 20-30 % of patients, especially among carriers of the ApoE4 gene.\nNovel treatments used alone or in combination for\nsignificant unmet medical needs.\nNon-Confidential Summary: For Intended Recipients Only 33\nAD: Current Clinical Trials\n• As of January 1, 2024, there were 164 trials for AD evaluating 127 drugs.\n• Most of these are small molecules and biologics, including vaccines, and 96\nwere DMTs, targeting single proteins or pathways (amyloid, tau,\nneuroinflammation, oxidative stress or lipid metabolism).\n• It is widely recognized that AD is a heterogeneous, multifactorial disorder\nimplicating multiple pathogenic pathways.\n• New treatment regimens will likely include combination therapies or drugs that\ncan target multiple pathways.\n• s-KL (secreted Klotho) has been shown to have anti-aging, cognitive enhancing,\nantioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and could offer a promising\nnovel therapeutic approach to treat or prevent this devastating disease.\nCummings J et al, 2024\nNon-Confidential Summary: For Intended Recipients Only 34\nAlzheimer’s Market\nNon-Confidential Summary: For Intended Recipients Only 35\nData – Aging and Alzheimer’s Cognition Models\n• The secreted Klotho isoform (s-KL) is almost exclusively\n(>90%) found in the brain and high expression levels of s-KL\ncorelate with brain health and healthy aging.\nAll groups showed the\ncapacity to learn the\n• We have leveraged AAV-based vectors to target the CNS\ntask, reflected by the\nleading to in vivo expression of s-KL in the brain and spinal gradual reduction in\ntime to perform it,\nfluid after i.v. administration in mice models of Alzheimer’s\nthough s-KL-treated\nand aging. animals learned it faster\n• A single i.v. dose of AAV-expressing s-KL had long-term effects\nand protected memory decline in mouse models of normal\naging.\n• Also, a single i.v. dose of AAV-expressing s-KL protected\nThe group overexpressing\nagainst memory decline in mouse models of accelerated\ns-KL showed better long-\naging. term memory.
