(Nasdaq: ELUT) (“Elutia” or the “Company”), a pioneer in drug-eluting biomatrix products, today provided a business update and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Business Highlights:**\n\n  * **First Commercial Use** : Announced the first patient implant of EluPro, the FDA-cleared antibiotic-eluting biologic envelope for pacemakers and neurostimulators.\n  * **Strong Initial Adoption** : EluPro is being utilized across all major cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) brands and in neurostimulation procedures. EluPro now accounts for 25% of BioEnvelope (CanGaroo and EluPro) sales.\n  * **Robust VAC Engagement** : EluPro has now been submitted to over 100 hospital system value analysis committees (VACs), with 36 accounts now actively ordering.\n  * **Expanded Sales Presence** : Strengthened sales team in key markets including Southern California and the Northeast, balancing direct and independent representation for efficient, targeted coverage. Sales team now includes 12 direct reps, 34 independent reps, and 9 product consultants.\n  * **GPO Access** : Advanced discussions with major group purchasing organizations (GPOs), including private health systems and the Veterans Administration (VA), with favorable coverage decisions anticipated by early 2025 to expand EluPro’s national availability.\n  * **Initiated Clinical Study** : Started a multi-center registry study to evaluate outcomes of patients receiving EluPro during cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation.\n  * **Peer Reviewed Publications:** Data published in _Frontiers in Drug Delivery_ journal showcasing EluPro’s effectiveness in eradicating bacteria linked to CIED infections, with additional manuscripts under review.\n  * **Business Development Activity** : Engaged in active discussions with multiple parties exploring opportunities for EluPro.\n\n\n\n“We achieved several significant milestones this quarter, including the first implant of EluPro, marking a pivotal advancement for our team and the patients we serve,” said Dr. Randy Mills, Elutia’s Chief Executive Officer. “As we prepare for EluPro’s full commercial launch in January 2025, we are energized by the strong initial market interest and clinical adoption. With EluPro’s promising start and the continued momentum of SimpliDerm, we are redefining the BioEnvelope and reconstructive markets so that patients can thrive without compromise. I want to thank our unstoppable CRU for their exceptional efforts.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023:\n\n  * Overall net sales decreased 3.3% to $5.9 million, compared to $6.1 million.\n  * Net sales for BioEnvelope products, including both EluPro and CanGaroo, decreased by 12%, totaling $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in Q3 2023, reflecting decreased sales of CanGaroo as customers anticipate the pending availability of EluPro in their accounts.\n  * Net sales of SimpliDerm increased 19% to $3.1 million, compared to $2.6 million.\n  * Net sales of Cardiovascular products were $0.6 million, a decrease of 40%, as LeMaitre Vascular continues transitioning Cardiovascular products into its sales strategy, in line with the Company’s exclusive distribution relationship.\n  * Gross margin on a GAAP basis was 46%, approximately the same from the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted gross margin (a non-GAAP measure which excludes non-cash amortization of intangibles) was 61%, compared to 60%. A reconciliation of GAAP gross margin to adjusted gross margin is included in the accompanying financial tables.\n  * Total operating expenses were $13.0 million, compared to $10.2 million. The increase resulted primarily from higher non-cash equity compensation charges in the current year period.\n  * Loss from operations was $10.2 million, compared to $7.4 million.\n  * Net income from continuing operations was $1.3 million, compared to a loss of $8.5 million. The increase was primarily due to a $12.7 million non-cash gain in the third quarter of 2024 related to the revaluation of the Company’s liability on warrants and pre-funded warrants related to the Company’s 2023 and 2024 financings.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure that excludes from net loss certain non-operating, non-cash and non-recurring items) was a loss of $2.9 million, compared to a loss of $1.7 million. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial tables.\n  * Cash balance as of September 30, 2024, was $25.7 million and includes approximately $13.8 million in proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants at the start of the quarter.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nElutia will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and performance.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed using the following information:\n\n**Webcast:** [Click here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S-nKeB9hB-BBKDsFHZJZDA5vglYoVxB0PcfCMVShzLkWTREzMOX28nwTeK8sHEcJ2egKF8J1t4wkIxcvNbMc2qYHcSWwgda--BrhfLuA-jCQ0IorlIVpdihTujb8MjrxBEik1fIGyEf1msw1FAPFkQ==)**U.S. Investors:** 877-407-8029**International Investors:** 201-689-8029**Conference ID:** 13749386\n\n**About Elutia**\n\nElutia develops and commercializes drug-eluting biomatrix products to improve compatibility between medical devices and the patients who need them. With a growing population in need of implantable technologies, Elutia’s mission is humanizing medicine so patients can thrive without compromise.

The Company presents in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit. The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and the Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding income from discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, FiberCel litigation costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, net of gain on debt forgiveness, loss or gain on revaluation of warrant liability and gain on revaluation of revenue interest obligation. The Company defines adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial information to establish budgets, manage the Company's business, and set incentive and compensation arrangements. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” and “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin.”\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “potential,” “promise” or similar references to future periods. All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including any statements and information concerning the launch of EluPro, including the timing and anticipated success thereof. These forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. Such beliefs and assumptions may or may not prove to be correct. Additionally, such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to the following: our ability to successfully commercialize, marked and sell our newly approved EluPro product; our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to achieve or sustain profitability; the risk of product liability claims and our ability to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance; our ability to defend against the various lawsuits and claims related to our recalled FiberCel and other viable bone matrix products and avoid a material adverse financial consequence from those lawsuits and claims; the continued and future acceptance of our products by the medical community; our ability to enhance our products, expand our product indications and develop, acquire and commercialize additional product offerings; our dependence on our commercial partners and independent sales agents to generate a substantial portion of our net sales; our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers, which, in certain cases are exclusive suppliers for products essential to our business; our ability to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the November 2023 sale of our Orthobiologics business; physician awareness of the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products; our ability to compete against other companies, most of which have longer operating histories, more established products and/or greater resources than we do; pricing pressure as a result of cost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability; our ability to obtain regulatory approval or other marketing authorizations by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities for our products and product candidates; and our ability to obtain, maintain and adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and other important factors which can be found in the “Risk Factors” section of Elutia’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including Elutia’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such factors may be updated from time to time in Elutia’s other filings with the SEC, including Elutia’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations page of Elutia’s website at https://investors.elutia.com.

The first patient implant of EluPro was completed in [September 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tMVQWakYAy2DcXOoj7D77spwt_9aAgPl2WQEJOSwiaIPW319NPomJiqxW-w3Gy2ePnFNZADanxTxf0LOTmOj8RTY91et-VAlXGNNBgOgqFNfQrUdALqgF9o4Sd93T6c9vAhozNX99PXfZI9h7GFhVGvdFSYJy3IAufiDd7pq6YYcA89BzFEe4A5hBnCcV7YmpahxsXKtq6taaDca2FZFJ9fKr8fJk8qyAZtHtfiDygQ=).\n\n“EluPro is a biologic envelope that has the ability to improve implant stability and reduce device migration. This latest study highlights EluPro’s potential to address the risk of bacterial contamination, a major concern in CIED procedures,” said Dr. M. Rizwan Sohail, Professor of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and an author on the publication. “Additionally, recent clinical findings suggest that EluPro may help minimize scarring and fibrosis around the implant, potentially making reoperation easier. Together, these insights highlight EluPro’s comprehensive approach to addressing a range of challenges associated with implantable devices.”\n\nThe studies were conducted using a well-established rabbit model of CIED infection. Devices were implanted with either EluPro or a non-antibiotic control envelope, and bacterial species were introduced. Implant sites were monitored for signs of infection for one week, and explanted envelopes were assessed for bacterial presence. The results revealed that none of the animals receiving EluPro exhibited signs of infection, whereas animals in the control group developed fevers, required supportive care, or experienced premature death. Additionally, EluPro demonstrated significant bacterial reduction at the implant sites, achieving complete eradication of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA, and other strains. Furthermore, EluPro provided sustained local antibiotic release for over a week with minimal systemic exposure, a key benefit of local drug delivery.\n\n“We believe these results greatly reinforce EluPro’s potential to provide enhanced infection control for CIED procedures,” said Michelle LeRoux Williams, Ph.D., Elutia’s Chief Scientific Officer. “As the first FDA-cleared biologic antibiotic-eluting envelope, EluPro represents a significant step forward in implantable device protection. With our recent milestone of the first human implant, we are preparing for the commercial launch of EluPro in January 2025.”\n\nFor more information about EluPro, visit [https://elutia.com/products/elupro/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mUm17ly0q0YOn98MqGy1muiIt5DW3fU7l99qNCtD7O0zxODZalQ3in3dNwW8tbixkr2ebX_mRGudHvjxehPrBlbLSolkLMRYfyk8FlFs5GSdclF2UnUPo-0tou_LwJkDpA3LEHsFCrlmxNCsA7I4QuVAUajnfQLQ1jYczGUu-7lg736iTONGh4txaEEdGQ71ECSGBOyqdpki-1JsN5WsEOQxs4ew5bDrL8pBEC4h6p86v5Rr-xk28ZUFKLQJBgfbti_rhYv9HSGjTSh1TIA-wNE9gAJ3BkXd1hTnnhPDttPrEa1vUUPj_KaMTyVU5YMl).\n\n**About Elutia** Elutia develops and commercializes drug-eluting biomatrix products to improve compatibility between medical devices and the patients who need them.

(Nasdaq: ELUT) (“Elutia”), a pioneer in drug-eluting biomatrix products, today announced a landmark achievement with the first-ever patient implant of EluPro®, the world’s first antibiotic-eluting biologic envelope cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The groundbreaking procedure was performed by John Catanzaro, MD, MBA, Chief, Division of Cardiology, Director, Cardiology Services, and Program Director of Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology Fellowship at East Carolina University Health Medical Center in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\n![EluPro](/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/inline-images/Elupro%20PR.jpg)\n\n“We are honored to be the first facility to implant EluPro,” said Dr. Catanzaro. “With its combination of proven antibiotics and biomatrix with demonstrated regenerative benefits, EluPro offers a more natural solution to reduce post-operative complications. This is a significant advancement in patient care, providing enhanced protection and peace of mind for patients needing a pacemaker or defibrillator.”\n\nAchieving this milestone demonstrates Elutia’s ability to deliver on its commitment to advancing healthcare with innovative solutions that address device complications.\n\n“Our mission is to humanize medicine so patients can thrive without compromise, and today, we made significant progress toward fulfilling that promise,” said Dr. Randy Mills, Elutia’s Chief Executive Officer. “Today’s milestone is a testament to the team’s relentless pursuit of better patient outcomes and I want to thank the entire Elutia CRU. With EluPro, physicians finally have a biologic antibiotic-eluting envelope to protect their patients, and we look forward to its full commercial launch in January 2025.”\n\nEluPro is designed to prevent post-operative complications in patients with cardiac implantable devices such as pacemakers and internal defibrillators. Cleared by the FDA in June 2024, it is also approved for use with additional devices, including neuromodulators and neurostimulators for pain management, epilepsy, incontinence, and sleep apnea.\n\nThe launch of EluPro presents a major opportunity in the $600 million U.S. implantable electronic device protection market, which has previously been served by a single competitor with a synthetic envelope. In addition to establishing a strong presence in the broader $8 billion cardiac rhythm management market, Elutia is also targeting adjacent neurostimulation and modulation sectors, which represent another $8 billion opportunity.\n\nFor more information about EluPro, visit [https://elutia.com/products/elupro/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SH8p1X9OenfXKKt2BqlLe_HVEDAdMeTSbo6WmiJjeoqVzvqKIq3D2QZzcfP-0Ffltk-S_3BUzuskAaG19HqAFdmIQFh7wIvk7kh3cuNHK_Fns8fcn5riCPab2U2vRAbQ).\n\n**About Elutia**\n\nElutia develops and commercializes drug-eluting biomatrix products to improve compatibility between medical devices and the patients who need them.

(Nasdaq: ELUT) (“Elutia” or the “Company”), a pioneer in drug-eluting biomatrix products, today provided a business update and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Received FDA clearance for EluPro®, the first antibiotic-eluting BioEnvelope for protecting patients with implantable electronic devices, including pacemakers, defibrillators, and neuromodulation devices.\n  * Completed a successful FDA inspection of the EluPro and CanGaroo manufacturing facility in Roswell, GA.\n  * Commenced manufacturing of EluPro ahead of commercial launch.\n  * Received enthusiastic responses from potential industry partners, treating physicians and hospital purchasing organizations regarding EluPro's availability.\n  * Strengthened the balance sheet with approximately $29.0 million in gross proceeds from a registered direct offering and exercise of warrants.\n  * Appointed industry veteran Ryan Marques, Ph.D., MBA, as Vice President of Operations.\n  * Initiated the expansion of commercial teams for both EluPro and SimpliDerm.\n\n\n\n“With the FDA clearance of EluPro, we are equipped with what we believe is a superior product, which is bringing us significant attention from a range of participants in the multi-billion-dollar pacemaker and defibrillator market,” said Dr. Randy Mills, Elutia’s Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, our manufacturing and quality systems were evaluated by the FDA with no deficiencies noted, clearing the way for commercial production of EluPro. Simultaneously, we have initiated the value analysis committee submission process, all in a coordinated effort to ensure this revolutionary product reaches our surgeon partners, enabling them to provide the best care for their patients.”\n\nDr. Mills continued, “With a robust financial position, we are laser focused on the successful launch of EluPro and further expanding our commercial footprint. We are systematically building our commercial teams for both EluPro and SimpliDerm and intensifying business development efforts to extend the reach of our drug-eluting biomatrix technology into adjacent markets covered under the EluPro approval. I want to thank our incredible team, who did a beautiful job executing on our plan to maximize the value of Elutia for all stakeholders.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nFor the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023:\n\n  * Overall net sales were essentially unchanged at $6.3 million.\n  * Net sales of CanGaroo increased 19% to $2.6 million, compared to $2.2 million.\n  * Net sales of SimpliDerm increased 7% to $2.6 million, compared to $2.4 million.\n  * Net sales of Cardiovascular products were $1.1 million, a decrease of 38%, reflecting the start of the Company’s exclusive distribution relationship with LeMaitre Vascular in April 2023.\n  * Gross margin on a GAAP basis was 45%, compared to 43%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to rectifying non-production issues in the SimpliDerm product line.\n  * Adjusted gross margin (a non-GAAP measure which excludes non-cash amortization of intangibles) was 58%, compared to 56%.\n  * Total operating expenses were $11.3 million, compared to $9.0 million. The increase included higher general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses.\n  * Loss from operations was $8.5 million, compared to $6.3 million.\n  * Net loss was $28.2 million, compared to a net loss of $10.6 million. The increased net loss was primarily due to an $18.3 million non-cash charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the revaluation of the Company’s liability on warrants and pre-funded warrants related to the Company’s September 2023 private placement financing.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure that excludes from net loss certain non-operating, non-cash and non-recurring items) was a loss of $2.9 million, compared to a loss of $3.4 million. A reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial tables.\n  * Cash balance as of June 30, 2024, was $18.2 million and does not reflect approximately $13.8 million in proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants following the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nElutia will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results and performance.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed using the following information:\n\n**Webcast:** [Click here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=unR5h76ZR0Fksi5Eey8cNZyE5eWGWZ3BpDCIW6o81jTkKiwDIK76E0JhVAAkf0Xqnsn1vKPG1r8ll5TA0aXLxlL8rJxPwReW6R-pLjSZz1HP9zDcHNWTBTofLfBY3ecpTR-8g3DHXWkcJyKfspx7kw==) **U.S. Investors:** 877-407-8029 **International Investors:** 201-689-8029 **Conference ID:** 13747696\n\n**About Elutia**\n\nElutia develops and commercializes drug-eluting biomatrix products to improve compatibility between medical devices and the patients who need them.

The Company presents in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit. The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and the Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding income from discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, FiberCel litigation costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, net of gain on debt forgiveness, loss on revaluation of warranty liability and gain on revaluation of revenue interest obligation. The Company defines adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial information to establish budgets, manage the Company's business, and set incentive and compensation arrangements. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” and “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin.”\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(Nasdaq: ELUT) (“Elutia” or the “Company”), a pioneer in drug-eluting biomatrix products, today announced that it had received gross proceeds of approximately $15.7 million from the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock issued in a private placement financing completed in September 2023.\n\n“The cash proceeds from these warrant exercises significantly strengthen Elutia’s balance sheet and provide us with a solid financial foundation for the launch of EluPro®, the world’s first FDA-cleared antibiotic-eluting BioEnvelope,” said Dr. Randy Mills, Elutia’s Chief Executive Officer. “The additional capital provided by existing investors reflects the substantial shareholder value the Company has created over the course of the last year. I want to thank the entire Elutia CRU for their tireless efforts in support of our mission to humanize medicine so patients can thrive without compromise.”\n\nPursuant to the previously announced private financing, Elutia sold an aggregate of 7,355,869 shares of the Company’s common stock (or pre-funded warrants) and 11,033,804 warrants to purchase common stock (or pre-funded warrants) at a price of $1.4275 per share and associated warrants (less $0.001 in the case of pre-funded warrants). Each common stock purchase warrant was exercisable at $1.4275 per share. All non-pre-funded common stock warrants issued in the private placement have been exercised.\n\nLake Street Capital Markets, LLC was the exclusive placement agent for the transaction.\n\nThe offer and sale of the foregoing securities were made in a transaction not involving a public offering, and their issuance was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or applicable state securities laws. The securities were issued in a private placement exempt from the Securities Act. The securities issued in the private placement may not be offered or resold in the United States absent registration or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy Elutia securities in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale of Elutia securities in any state in which such offer or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state.\n\n**About Elutia**\n\nElutia develops and commercializes drug-eluting biomatrix products to improve compatibility between medical devices and the patients who need them. With a growing population in need of implantable technologies, Elutia’s mission is humanizing medicine so patients can thrive without compromise.

Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions and expectations of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our business, strategy, operations or financial performance, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and other important factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contemplated or implied in this press release, including, but not limited to: our ability to continue as a going concern; the risk of product liability claims and our ability to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance; our ability to defend against the various lawsuits related to our recalled FiberCel and other viable bone matrix products and avoid a material adverse financial consequence from those lawsuits; our ability to achieve or sustain profitability; our ability to enhance our products, expand our product indications and develop, acquire and commercialize additional product offerings; our dependence on our commercial partners and independent sales agents to generate a substantial portion of our net sales; our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers, which, in certain cases are exclusive suppliers for products essential to our business; our ability to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of the November 2023 sale of our Orthobiologics business; physician awareness of the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products; the continued and future acceptance of our products by the medical community; our ability to compete against other companies, most of which have longer operating histories, more established products and/or greater resources than we do; pricing pressure as a result of cost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability; our ability to obtain, maintain and adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and other important factors which can be found in the “Risk Factors” section of Elutia’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including Elutia’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such factors may be updated from time to time in Elutia’s other filings with the SEC, including Elutia’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations page of Elutia’s website at https://investors.elutia.com.
