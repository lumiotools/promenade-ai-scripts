(Nasdaq: CELU) (“Celularity”) a regenerative and cellular medicine company, today announced that it has increased expected net sales guidance for the full year 2024 to $54 million to $60 million, up from $50 million to $56 million previously announced in February. The increased guidance is based on higher expected net sales through October of its advanced biomaterial products. Expected net sales for full year 2024 consist of $49 million to $54.5 million sales of advanced biomaterial products and $5.0 million to $5.5 million net sales of biobanking services. For the full year 2024, Celularity now expects net sales of its advanced biomaterial products to grow by 180% to 212% over the prior year.\n\nOctober expected net sales were $8.3 million to $8.9 million, marking Celularity’s highest-ever single-month expected net sales. For the ten months ending October 31, 2024, expected net sales were $44.4 million, consisting of advanced biomaterial product sales of $40.2 million and biobanking sales of $4.2 million, and includes approximately $9 million in expected net sales of Celularity’s new Rebound™ product. Rebound adds to Celularity’s portfolio of placental-derived advanced biomaterial products, sales of which through the first half of 2024 exceeded $24 million, which is greater than Celularity’s full-year sales in 2023.\n\n“We had very strong second and third quarter performances, and based on such performance we have increased the full year 2024 expected net sales guidance we previously announced in February,” said Dr. Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, Chairman, and CEO. “Sales are strong for our new Rebound product, which we believe will strengthen our revenue outlook for the next several quarters. We continue to advance development of next generation advanced biomaterial products while exploring all opportunities in the rapidly evolving landscape of cellular and regenerative medicine. We believe Celularity can leverage our unique business model, world-class technical infrastructure and intellectual property, and growing commercial traction as we enter 2025 and beyond.”\n\nCelularity also announced that it filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter 2024 on November 6, 2024. As previously announced, Celularity received a determination notification from Nasdaq on October 16, 2024 indicating non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Rule) due to the delayed filing of Celularity’s quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024 (collectively, the “Forms 10-Q”). Celularity has now filed the Forms 10-Q in compliance with the Rule.\n\nDr. Hariri added, “With the completion of our Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarter, we reaffirm our commitment to regaining and maintaining compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements. To further strengthen our reporting processes, we have implemented several key improvements to help mitigate delays in the future. These enhancements include engaging additional technical accounting resources, upgrading our internal review protocols, and collaborating closely with our external auditors to ensure timely and accurate financial disclosures.”\n\n**About Celularity**\n\nCelularity Inc.

On September 5, 2024, Celularity submitted an updated compliance plan to Nasdaq, and Nasdaq subsequently granted Celularity an extension until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance with the Rule. On October 16, 2024, Nasdaq notified Celularity that, as the Forms 10-Q had not been filed within the extension period, Celularity would be suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on October 25, 2024, unless an appeal was filed by October 23, 2024.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, Celularity timely filed an appeal and amended compliance plan with the Hearings Panel and requested a hearing, which temporarily stays suspension or delisting action. Celularity also requested that the stay remain in effect through the hearing process and any additional extension period granted by the Hearings Panel.\n\nCelularity remains committed to regaining compliance, having filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, on October 16, 2024, and is in the final stages of preparing its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024. The Hearings Panel has the discretion to grant Celularity up to an additional 180 days to regain compliance, but there is no assurance that Celularity’s appeal will be successful or that Celularity will regain or maintain compliance with the Rule or other Nasdaq listing requirements.\n\n**About Celularity**\n\nCelularity Inc.

(Nasdaq: CELU) (“Celularity”), a regenerative and cellular medicine company, has issued a Corporate Update to Shareholders from Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, Chairman, and CEO.\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to share recent developments at Celularity, including an update on our commercial-stage advanced biomaterial products business.\n\nLet me start by reiterating what we said in our [announcement](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=71heIlEJV_Z1OnlmdBkKVy4L9v-9-Rsnz26ltE4dusudxpqKx2FeuANxKkcQB0k-vpJT9EUeR4w1o_qTxOTuz_qWWcKY1hsjzSEsTf_OzCGxMJIWKS0yW6JH3uE4Oy5rdh_v-7yloJ_tiWyHzCHSbY1XmDFAjuz0L_jiNvyXN2lttkmNEVhxjkv4PbjphW4XLNQKk0ncv7uUo5nqaPStFuOI-sMYwsuY0a03Rfy2tk9X2ZWwVpzvKHIOA4XGCm3V \"announcement\") last week, which is that we are resolutely committed to regaining full compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. We acknowledge the importance of timely filings and have been diligently working with our new auditing firm to complete the necessary financial reports.\n\nWe filed our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 within the compliance period and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2024 on October 16, 2024. Additionally, we intend to file our Form 10-Q for the second quarter 2024 within the coming weeks. As stated in last week’s announcement, the notice we received from Nasdaq has no immediate effect on the listing of Celularity’s common stock and warrants, which continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “CELU” and “CELUW,” respectively.\n\nTurning to our commercial advanced biomaterials business, Biovance®3L has proved a significant addition to our commercial portfolio, especially since the third quarter of 2023 when it was granted a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Q code by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The Q code (and other codes) issued by CMS are used to facilitate the processing of health insurance claims by Medicare and other insurers.\n\nFrom time to time, we selectively assess opportunities to acquire existing products that we believe could complement and expand our commercial product portfolio. Last week, we [announced ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=71heIlEJV_Z1OnlmdBkKV-2eYdFGayXsm5Ah_8H9UfAs-KOqaKlSzNp0KX359KFaFD2wfJuPsdpPpsIqu35TwtTRAWC8JilLFkHPGRod4q_NBAOLQwYUWPVdLuAH_iLssFgq50ddThwIoPLCKz0GHQ== \"announced\")the acquisition of Rebound, a full thickness placental-derived allograft matrix product, from Sequence LifeScience, Inc. (“Sequence”). We have sold in excess of $9 million of Rebound, which is reimbursed in POS 11, 12, and 32 via HCPCS Code Q4296 when medically necessary.\n\nAs noted in that announcement, the acquisition of Rebound adds to our portfolio of placental-derived advanced biomaterial products, sales of which through the first half of 2024 were in excess of $24 million, which is greater than our full year sales in 2023. Looking to the future, we continue to advance product candidates for indications that include aging-associated and other degenerative diseases and disorders characterized by the progressive loss of function and/or structure of the affected tissues:\n\n  * Celularity Tendon Wrap, a high strength scaffold composed of collagen and other native proteins derived from decellularized human placental tissue that the Company is developing for use in the management and protection of tendon injuries.\n  * Celularity Bone Void Filler, an easy to handle, moldable bone void filler composed of collagen and other native proteins derived from decellularized human placental tissue that the Company is developing for use as a passive osteoconductive bone filler in the pelvis, extremities, and posterior-lateral spinal fusion settings as well as other skeletal defects.\n  * Celularity Placental Matrix, a fully resorbable device composed of extracellular matrix derived from decellularized human placental tissue that the Company is developing for use as a passive temporary wound covering and in aesthetics.\n\n\n\nWe expect these human placental tissue-derived products to be regulated in the United States as a device under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Celularity Tendon Wrap, FUSE Bone Void Filler, and Celularity Placental Matrix each completed preliminary non-binding product classifications and jurisdictional assessments by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) to be regulated as a device by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. Based on the OCP’s preliminary assessment, we intend to submit a 510(k) notification for our Celularity Tendon Wrap in early 2025 and for our FUSE Bone Void Filler in the second half of 2025 and for Celularity Placental Matrix in 2026. We also are developing another product, Celularity Placental Dermal Filler Matrix, as a Class III medical device, for which we would be required to submit a premarket approval application (“PMA”) to the FDA.\n\nWe are working hard to execute our plan to expand Celularity’s advanced biomaterial products business and continue to sharpen the focus of the mission-driven organization we have built over the past several months to ensure our team is lean, agile, and working to build shareholder value. With that said, we are confident in our previously stated guidance of expected combined Net Sales of our advanced biomaterial product and biobanking businesses to be in the range of $50 million to $56 million.\n\nI have no doubt that the current market climate is of concern to our investors; we are grateful to you, our shareholders, for your continued support as we navigate today’s challenging landscape and remain focused on the long-term opportunities to create meaningful shareholder value. I look forward to reporting back to you as we execute our plan over the balance of 2024 and beyond.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert J.

(Nasdaq: CELU) (“Celularity”), a regenerative and cellular medicine company, today announced that it had added to its commercial portfolio of placental-derived advanced biomaterial products with the acquisition of Rebound, a full thickness placental-derived allograft matrix product, from Sequence LifeScience, Inc. (“Sequence”).\n\n“Rebound adds to our portfolio of placental-derived advanced biomaterial products, sales of which through the first half of 2024 were in excess of $24 million, which is greater than our full year sales in 2023,” said Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and founder of Celularity. “We expect Rebound sales to contribute meaningfully in the fourth quarter 2024 and to fulfill expected full year 2024 biomaterial sales which we announced in February, augmenting our other revenues from biobanking and research agreements,” added Dr. Hariri. “I am very pleased with Celularity’s commercial traction and optimistic about our future performance.”\n\nRebound complements Celularity’s existing portfolio of advanced biomaterials, which includes innovative placental-derived products that have shown strong market demand. The addition of Rebound enhances Celularity’s ability to address a broader patient population in wound care and soft tissue repair. By leveraging the unique properties of placental tissues, Celularity continues to differentiate itself in the regenerative medicine market, providing physicians and patients with advanced, natural solutions designed to improve healing outcomes. This acquisition aligns with Celularity’s strategic vision of expanding its offerings and reinforces its leadership in the field of placental-derived biomaterials.\n\nAbout Celularity\n\nCelularity Inc. (Nasdaq: CELU) is an innovative regenerative and cellular medicine company. It is developing and commercializing advanced biomaterial products and allogeneic, cryopreserved, placental-derived cell therapies, all derived from the postpartum placenta. What sets Celularity apart is its therapeutic programs that target aging-related diseases, including degenerative diseases, cancer, and immune disorders, using mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells (MLASCs), T-cells engineered with CAR (CAR T-cells), and genetically modified and unmodified natural killer (NK) cells. Celularity’s unique approach, harnessing the placenta’s biology and ready availability, is paving the way for therapeutic solutions that address significant unmet global needs for effective, accessible, and affordable therapies.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as well as within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The cells were stained for CD56, CD20,\nFigure 2. PT-CD16VS Cells Exhibit Potent Functional Activity vs. HER2+ NCI-N87 Gastric Tumor Cells CD5, CD16, and TCR-α/β expression.

Co-cultures were harvested, counted, and analyzed by flow cytometry to enumerate the C. D. total number of CD16+ per condition following 2-3 days of co-culture. Fold change was calculated by dividing the number of CD16+ T cells in\ncombination with Trastuzumab by the number of CD16 + T cells detected in combination with the IgG control. In vivo Anti-Tumor Model: A subcutaneous HER2+ gastric cancer (NCI-N87) model was established in NSG mice. Mice were inoculated with 5 x\n106 NCI-N87 subcutaneously on Day 0. Ten days post NCI-N87 inoculation, mice were preconditioned with busulfan (30 mg/kg,\nintraperitoneal injection). On Day 13, mice were randomized by tumor volume into 5 treatment groups of 12 animals per group: Vehicle\n(Group 1), Trastuzumab 10mg/kg (Group 2), 10 x 106 total PT-CD16VS (Group 3), 10 x 106total PT-CD16VS + 10mg/kg Trastuzumab (Group 4),\nand Enhertu 10mg/kg (Group 5). On Day 35, the Enhertu group was sacrificed and Groups 2, 3, and 4 received a low dose of Trastuzumab\n(2.5mg/kg) to evaluate the persistence of PT-CD16VS cells. The remaining mice were sacrificed on Day 45 or Day 49. Tumor volume was\nevaluated twice weekly. E.
