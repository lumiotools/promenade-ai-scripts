(Nasdaq: DNTH), a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to advancing the next generation of antibody complement therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024 and provided an update on recent business achievements.\n\n“We are excited to expand DNTH103 beyond gMG and MMN into CIDP before year end. Like gMG and MMN, CIDP has significant unmet needs where a best-in-class, potent classical pathway inhibitor can potentially make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients. We believe this single, two-part, pivotal Phase 3 trial will support BLA filing in adult patients with CIDP and we anticipate initiating the trial by year-end 2024,” said Marino Garcia, Chief Executive Officer of Dianthus Therapeutics. “We continue to be confident in the pipeline-in-a-product potential of DNTH103 across multiple autoimmune diseases, supported by our proof-of-concept _in vitro_ data most recently presented at AANEM and ICNMD and competitor clinical data that further validate targeting the classical pathway and active C1s.”\n\n**_DNTH103 Clinical Development_**\n\nDNTH103 is an investigational, clinical-stage, potent monoclonal antibody engineered to selectively target the classical pathway by inhibiting only the active form of the C1s protein, a clinically validated complement target. DNTH103 is enhanced with YTE half-life extension technology designed to enable a more convenient subcutaneous, self-administered injection dosed as infrequently as once every two weeks. DNTH103 has the potential to be a best-in-class pipeline-in-a-product across a range of autoimmune disorders with high unmet need.\n\n**Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)**\n\n  * **Phase 2 MaGic gMG trial ongoing:** The [MaGic trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06282159) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in patients with gMG who are acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive, and it remains on track to report top-line results in 2H’25.\n  * **Poster presentations at AANEM and ICNMD:** Encore [poster presentations](https://investor.dianthustx.com/scientific-publications) at the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting in Savannah, Georgia and at the 18th International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases (ICNMD) in Perth, Australia highlighted preclinical and _in vitro_ data describing the potentially differentiated profile of DNTH103 in a disease model of gMG.\n\n\n\n**Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)**\n\n  * **Phase 2 MoMeNtum MMN trial ongoing:** The [MoMeNtum trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT06537999) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DNTH103 in patients with MMN, and it remains on track to report top-line results in 2H’26.\n\n\n\n**Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**\n\n  * **Initiation of a Phase 3 trial in CIDP anticipated by YE’24:** Dianthus plans to initiate a single, two-part, randomized withdrawal Phase 3 trial of DNTH103 in CIDP by YE’24. In the open label Part A of this trial, participants will be administered a loading dose followed by 300mg DNTH103 administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) via subcutaneous (S.C.) injection for up to 13 weeks. Part A includes an interim responder analysis of a pre-defined number of participants. Only participants who respond to DNTH103 in Part A will be randomized into Part B, a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of up to 52 weeks, where they will be assessed for prevention of relapse, safety and tolerability, followed by an open-label extension period. The Company believes this single pivotal trial will support BLA filing in adult patients with CIDP. Additional details regarding Phase 3 trial design and timelines will be provided by YE’24.\n  * **Poster presentations at AANEM and ICNMD:** Encore [poster presentations](https://investor.dianthustx.com/scientific-publications) at the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting in Savannah, Georgia and at the 18th International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases (ICNMD) in Perth, Australia highlighted preclinical and _in vitro_ data describing the potentially differentiated profile of DNTH103 in a disease model of CIDP, in addition to head-to-head affinity and pharmacodynamic (PD) potency data for DNTH103 compared to riliprubart.\n\n\n\n**_Corporate Updates_**\n\n  * Effective September 16, 2024, Steven Romano, M.D., was appointed to the Dianthus Therapeutics Board of Directors. Dr. Romano is a pharmaceutical executive with more than 28 years of experience in drug development across a wide range of therapeutic and disease areas. He currently serves as Executive Vice President, Chief Research and Development Officer at Silence Therapeutics.\n\n\n\n**_Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n  * **Cash Position** - $342.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 is projected to provide runway into the second half of 2027.\n  * **R &D Expenses** - Research and development (R&D) expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $25.5 million, inclusive of $1.7 million of stock-based compensation, compared to $8.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which included $0.4 million of stock-based compensation. This increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by higher clinical costs, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) costs and increased headcount to support DNTH103 Phase 2 and Phase 3 development.\n  * **G &A Expenses** - General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $6.5 million, inclusive of stock-based compensation of $2.2 million, compared to $8.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which included $0.8 million of stock-based compensation. This decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to lower personnel costs.\n  * **Net Loss** - Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $25.2 million or $0.74 per share (basic and diluted) compared to $14.8 million or $3.78 per share (basic and diluted) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About DNTH103** DNTH103 is an investigational, clinical-stage, potent monoclonal antibody engineered to selectively target the classical pathway by inhibiting only the active form of the C1s protein, a clinically validated complement target. DNTH103 is enhanced with YTE half-life extension technology designed to enable a more convenient subcutaneous, self-administered injection dosed as infrequently as once every two weeks.

As the classical pathway plays a significant role in disease pathology, DNTH103 has the potential to be a best-in-class pipeline-in-a-product across a range of autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. Dianthus is building a neuromuscular franchise with DNTH103 following the initiation of the Phase 2 MaGic trial in generalized Myasthenia Gravis in 1Q’24 and the Phase 2 MoMeNtum trial in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy in 3Q’24, and initiation of a Phase 3 trial in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy anticipated by YE’24.\n\nDNTH103 is an investigational agent that is not approved as a therapy in any indication in any jurisdiction worldwide.\n\n**About Dianthus Therapeutics** Dianthus Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to designing and delivering novel, best-in-class monoclonal antibodies with improved selectivity and potency.
