(NASDAQ: SEAT) (“Vivid Seats” or “we”), a leading marketplace that utilizes its technology platform to connect millions of buyers with thousands of ticket sellers across hundreds of thousands of events each year, today provided financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"Demand remained robust in the third quarter, although we experienced a headwind from concert supply, including from venue and artist mix, that we believe to be temporary,\" said Stan Chia, Vivid Seats CEO. \"We expect industry growth to accelerate in 2025 as concerts return to their long-term trend. In the third quarter, we operated with discipline and delivered strong unit economics, while executing strongly and generating synergies with our Vegas.com acquisition through both cross-listed inventory and by converting Vegas.com customers to Vivid Seats customers. Lastly, we are excited to announce that Skybox Drive has exited its beta phase and we are already in the process of onboarding more than one hundred users, with hundreds more on our waitlist. As we ramp adoption, the innovative pricing functionality of Skybox Drive will further enforce the stickiness of Skybox and fortify our already leading position with professional sellers.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Operational and Financial Metrics**\n\n  * Marketplace GOV of $871.7 million – down 13% from $998.9 million in Q3 2023\n  * Revenues of $186.6 million – down 1% from $188.1 million in Q3 2023\n  * Net income of $9.2 million – down 43% from $16.0 million in Q3 2023\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $34.1 million – up 2% from $33.4 million in Q3 2023\n\n\n\n\"Despite a decline in Marketplace GOV in the third quarter, we held year-over-year revenues roughly flat and grew Adjusted EBITDA through disciplined execution while maintaining our strong unit economics,\" said Lawrence Fey, Vivid Seats CFO. \"Given third quarter concert supply dynamics and expected marketing intensity in the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2024 guidance. As more concert tour announcements come out over the coming weeks, we will gain visibility into the 2025 concert calendar, where we currently anticipate a return to healthy growth.\"\n\n**Key Performance Indicators ('000s)**\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**| **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nMarketplace GOV(1)| $| 871,726| $| 998,933| $| 2,898,269| $| 2,808,200  \nTotal Marketplace orders(2)| 2,969| 3,022| 8,943| 7,924  \nTotal Resale orders(3)| 116| 110| 316| 273  \nAdjusted EBITDA(4)| $| 34,077| $| 33,367| $| 117,172| $| 106,879  \n  \n(1)| Marketplace Gross Order Value (\"Marketplace GOV\") represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes and net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Marketplace GOV was negatively impacted by cancellations in the amount of $35.4 million and $74.9 million, respectively, compared to $10.1 million and $33.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Marketplace segment experienced 77,012 and 179,453 cancellations, respectively, compared to 28,203 and 78,034 cancellations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.  \n(3)| Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Resale segment experienced 2,411 and 4,494 cancellations, respectively, compared to 851 and 2,363 cancellations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.  \n(4)| Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for making period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. See the _Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ section below for more information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable US GAAP measure.  \n  \n**2024 Financial Outlook** Vivid Seats now anticipates Marketplace GOV, revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2024 to be:\n\n  * Marketplace GOV in the range of $3.8 to $4.0 billion (previously $4.0 to $4.3 billion)\n  * Revenues in the range of $760.0 to $780.0 million (previously $810.0 to $830.0 million)\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $145.0 to $155.0 million (previously $160.0 to $170.0 million)* \n\n\n\nAdditional detail around the 2024 outlook will be available on the third quarter 2024 earnings call. \n\n*We calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA based on internal forecasts that omit certain information that would be included in forward-looking net income, the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. We do not attempt to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to forward-looking net income because the timing and/or probable significance of certain excluded items that have not yet occurred and are out of our control is inherently uncertain and unavailable without unreasonable efforts. Such items could have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future US GAAP financial results.\n\n**Webcast Details** Vivid Seats will host a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results, business updates and financial outlook. Participants may access the live webcast and supplemental earnings presentation on the events page of the Vivid Seats Investor Relations website at _[https://investors.vividseats.com/events-and-presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0fo5TTrtHipWI63Q6VO3Fk_9opABQVmOL9Fyfh1HHgofdh4gWPPU9T0CvXJUguaF2cShlvP191gI-TQ-erU0vXXSFqMcZro_FnYsFsUquSYqoQDUAky0kgODZdLU-gHHwbubR3cjWrkbYty3ts0xnE15667byfm-9o-boXRe2DAN64Zn8zHUgCmg2lSsBbLY)_.\n\n**About Vivid Seats** Founded in 2001, Vivid Seats is a leading online ticket marketplace committed to becoming the ultimate partner for connecting fans to the live events, artists, and teams they love.

non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes the impact of items that are outside of our control or not reflective of ongoing performance related directly to the operation of our business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management team internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for making period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and highlighting trends in our operating results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with US GAAP and may exclude recurring costs, such as interest expense – net, equity-based compensation, litigation, settlements and related costs, change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of derivative assets and foreign currency revaluation losses (gains). In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the US GAAP amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable US GAAP measure, net income (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**| **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income| $| 9,196| $| 16,018| $| 18,716| $| 84,616  \nIncome tax expense (benefit)| 4,290| 2,595| 7,136| (21,605| )  \nInterest expense – net| 6,300| 2,544| 16,706| 8,596  \nDepreciation and amortization| 10,669| 3,301| 31,654| 8,603  \nSales tax liability(1)| 526| —| 2,613| —  \nTransaction costs(2)| 1,243| 2,290| 6,649| 7,234  \nEquity-based compensation(3)| 10,685| 7,578| 38,284| 20,488  \nLitigation, settlements and related costs(4)| 157| 26| 164| 260  \nChange in fair value of warrants(5)| (3,952| )| (1,664| )| (5,713| )| (991| )  \nChange in fair value of derivative asset(6)| 456| 83| 537| 83  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration(7)| —| 20| —| (998| )  \nLoss on asset disposals(8)| 38| 34| 160| 51  \nForeign currency revaluation losses (gains)(9)| (5,531| )| 542| 266| 542  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **34,077**| **$**| **33,367**| **$**| **117,172**| **$**| **106,879**  \n  \n(1)| We have historically incurred sales tax expense in jurisdictions where we expected to collect and remit indirect taxes, but were not yet collecting from customers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we accrued for additional sales and indirect tax liabilities in jurisdictions where we are not yet collecting from customers and settled certain local admission tax liabilities for less than the amount that was accrued as of December 31, 2023.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Relates to legal, accounting, tax and other professional fees; personnel-related costs, which consist of retention bonuses; integration costs; and other transaction-related expenses.

Costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to a secondary offering of our Class A common stock, acquisitions and strategic investments.  \n(3)| Relates to equity granted pursuant to our 2021 Incentive Award Plan, as amended, and profits interests issued prior to our merger transaction with Horizon Acquisition Corporation (the “Merger Transaction”), neither of which are considered indicative of our core operating performance.  \n(4)| Relates to external legal costs, settlement costs and insurance recoveries that were unrelated to our core business operations.  \n(5)| Relates to the revaluation of warrants to purchase common units of Hoya Intermediate, LLC held by Hoya Topco, LLC following the Merger Transaction.  \n(6)| Relates to the revaluation of derivatives recorded at fair value.  \n(7)| Relates to the revaluation of Vivid Picks cash earnouts.  \n(8)| Relates to asset disposals, which are not considered indicative of our core operating performance.  \n(9)| Relates to unrealized foreign currency revaluation losses (gains) from the remeasurement of non-operating assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies on the balance sheet date.  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MTI5MzFlMzItYmUyZS00OGIwLWEyZTMtZGNiZDRlMWFlNDhmLTEwOTg5MDI=/tiny/Vivid-Seats-LLC.png)\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vividseats \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/vividseats/ \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.instagram.com/vividseats \"LinkedIn\")\n\n\n"

(NASDAQ: SEAT) (“Vivid Seats” or “we”), a leading marketplace that utilizes its technology platform to connect millions of buyers with thousands of ticket sellers across hundreds of thousands of events each year, today announced the effective date of the appointment of Adam Stewart to its Board of Directors is November 1, 2024. Stewart has also been appointed to Vivid Seats’ Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. He joins Vivid Seats’ Board with extensive Media and Entertainment experience, including nearly two decades at Google, where he currently serves as Vice President, Consumer, Government & Entertainment.\n\n“We are proud to welcome Adam to Vivid Seats’ Board of Directors,” said Stan Chia, Vivid Seats CEO. “He is an expert in performance marketing, a seasoned technology leader, and an experienced board member. We look forward to benefiting from Adam’s insight and guidance, as we continue to diversify our marketing channels while driving efficiencies and repeat orders. Given the depth of his experience, this appointment will further enhance the skillset and expertise of our esteemed Board, as we continue our focus on building shareholder value and executing our long-term growth strategy.”\n\n“It's a privilege to join the Vivid Seats Board of Directors,” said Stewart. “As a dynamic and innovative company dedicated to providing exceptional customer experiences and connecting fans with unforgettable events, I'm excited to collaborate with the Board and management team to further Vivid Seats' growth and success.”\n\nCurrently at Google, Stewart leads advertising partnerships and solutions for Google, YouTube and the Google Marketing Platform, focusing on Consumer Goods, Government, and Entertainment sectors. His previous role at Google was Industry Director of Media & Entertainment.
