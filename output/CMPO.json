(Nasdaq: CMPO), a leader in metal payment cards, security, and authentication solutions, today announced its operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nJon Wilk, President and CEO of CompoSecure, commented: “We are very pleased with our third quarter performance which included double-digit growth for both Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA. The quarter was driven by strong international execution, continued growth of new programs, and the growing adoption of our innovative payment cards. I am also happy to announce that we signed a two-year contract extension with Capital One.”\n\n“Although we are reporting a GAAP Net Loss for the quarter, this was entirely driven by the significant improvement in our stock price this quarter, which impacts the valuation of non-cash items. Importantly, our Adjusted Net Income was up 18% compared to the year-ago period, which we believe more accurately reflects our operating performance.”\n\nMr. Wilk continued: “We are also enhancing our capabilities to drive accretive M&A and remain focused on strategic investments in our business. To support this growth, we are revising our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year to account for additional investments aimed at accelerating our momentum.”\n\nDave Cote, CompoSecure’s Executive Chairman, added: “As we embark on this next chapter, I want to express how excited I am about our long-term opportunities as well as our challenges ahead. We were attracted to the business because it hit the six hot buttons we used to evaluate acquisitions at Honeywell: Great position, good industry, technology differentiator, organic and inorganic sales growth, and margin expansion. That being said, this is a pivotal time for the company, and we are committed to building a culture centered on high performance, improving efficiency through the CompoSecure Operating System, reinvigorating organic growth, and driving accretive M&A. That work will require investment and you will see that reflected in our full year estimate.”\n\n**Financial Highlights (****Q3** **2024****vs.****Q3** **2023****)**\n\n  * **Net Sales** : Net Sales increased 11% to $107.1 million compared to $96.9 million. The increase was primarily driven by strong international demand and product innovation.\n\n\n  * **Gross Profit:** Gross Profit increased to $55.4 million or 52% of Net Sales, compared to $48.9 million or 50%. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and improved production efficiencies.\n\n\n  * **Net****Income/EPS** : Net Income/(Loss) of $(85.5) million compared to $38.0 million. The decrease was driven by an improvement to the Company’s stock price during the quarter, which led to a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities, earnout consideration liability and derivative liability. Net Income/(Loss) per share attributable to Class A common shareholders was $(1.10) (Basic) and $(1.10) (Diluted), compared to $0.39 (Basic) and $0.34 (Diluted) in the year-ago period.\n\n\n  * **Adjusted Net Income/Adjusted EPS:** Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) increased 18% to $25.6 million compared to $21.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS (a non-GAAP measure), which includes both Class A and Class B shares, was $0.31 (Basic) and $0.27 (Diluted) compared to $0.27 (Basic) and $0.24 (Diluted) in the year-ago period (see reconciliation of non-GAAP measures shown in table below).\n\n\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** : Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) increased 13% to $40.0 million compared to $35.5 million, with the increase driven by net sales growth and gross margin expansion.\n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Structure**\n\n**Balance Sheet:** At September 30, 2024, CompoSecure had $52.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $330.0 million of total debt, which included $200.0 million of term loan and $130.0 million of exchangeable notes. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $41.2 million and total debt of $340.3 million at December 31, 2023, and cash and cash equivalents of $23.8 million and total debt of $345.0 million at September 30, 2023. CompoSecure’s secured debt leverage ratio was 1.06x at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.39x at December 31, 2023 and 1.48x at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Shares Outstanding:** On September 17, 2024, Resolute Holdings and its affiliated vehicles (“Resolute”) completed the acquisition of a majority interest in CompoSecure through stock purchase agreements among Resolute and certain selling shareholders. In the transaction, the selling shareholders exchanged all of their Class B units for Class A shares and Resolute acquired 49.3 million Class A shares, representing approximately 60% of CompoSecure’s outstanding shares. At September 30, 2024, CompoSecure had 82.7 million shares outstanding all of which were Class A shares, with the increase resulting from the Resolute Holdings transaction.\n\n**Exchangeable Notes**\n\n  * Effective September 19, 2024, Resolute’s acquisition of a majority of the Company’s common stock caused a Fundamental Change, as defined in the Indenture pursuant to which $130 million of 7% Exchangeable Senior Notes, due 2026 (“Notes”) were issued by a subsidiary of the Company. This Fundamental Change provides holders of the Notes a choice to: \n    * Exchange the Notes for shares of Class A Common Stock at a temporarily increased exchange rate of 104.5199 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes until November 27, 2024 (with the exchange rate then reverting to the existing 91.0972 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes)\n    * Have the Company repurchase for cash of all of such holder’s Notes on November 29, 2024 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest\n    * Continue to hold the Notes\n\n\n  * Through November 6, 2024, an aggregate of $51.4 million of the Notes have been surrendered and exchanged for an aggregate of 5.4 million newly-issued shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\n\n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\n  * Announced a two-year contract extension with Capital One\n\n\n  * New customer programs included US Bank Smartly, Goldman Sachs Debit, IDFC India, HSBC Global Singapore, BTG Brazio, Qonto France, Military Bank Vietnam\n\n\n  * Tom Knott, Joseph DeAngelo, Roger Fradin, Mark James, John Cote, and Dr. Krishna Mikkilineni also appointed to the Board of Directors\n\n\n  * Achieved ISO 27001 Certification for Premium Card Manufacturing (ISO 27001 is the globally recognized information security management system (ISMS) standard)\n\n\n\n**2024 Financial Outlook** CompoSecure is revising its full year Net Sales guidance to $418-$424 million (previously $418-$428 million) and its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $148-$151 million (previously $150-157 million) to reflect investments for future growth.\n\n**Conference Call** CompoSecure will host a conference call and live audio webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial and operational results, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Friday, November 8, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time[Dial-in registration link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=82vz33zv4SVD2zqftYqb56MLD0-N1QWSthe99ZK5piMFJMqJxCQ8h3JbroODXXlQEXWjmV9rNB-WFmdH2I7lUgWxrhyjXlqQvi9vMmusinbHILZjKl54aFS4uHF1lr3xUxFNy2MPUm-Rd4ygKzYnCS9N5RnLOq-rZBvAlhUCLQI=)[Live webcast registration link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K19qDRycv3yN_QLZ1YvKIeqmRG6YujKpAYXQO-NaoWPh__nVz4lwO1j9DWH06547aYmp6Gfih8SqIFX_w_u2lRoS0yQNbWvcOvqI0SA0Pv6czU21IlFQ-ESvEPGZNjJVLNBy0E-WSG_BFfrsIF-qNA==)If you have any difficulty registering or connecting with the conference call, please contact Elevate IR at (720) 330-2829.\n\nA live webcast and replay of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of CompoSecure’s website at [https://ir.composecure.com/news-events/events](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2UxQTyJ81gGroUOpz5XxDTftjwF6MJfffDK97DWPBWoEM1quGQrIK-_gxB7b3Z9Ti9D4i0nr7jOX6nkU8JZhzxIwrhW2DbaFjx_xpluOIoo4L93DQafww4unR0qdp_G_3tVC1IgD6RCPEoOjx9ZS3lAVjK_pO8ksXkcjJWkH8lo=).\n\n**About CompoSecure** Founded in 2000, CompoSecure (Nasdaq: CMPO) is a technology partner to market leaders, fintech’s and consumers enabling trust for millions of people around the globe.

These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management. Although CompoSecure believes that its plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, CompoSecure cannot assure you that it will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning CompoSecure’s possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. In some instances, these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of the date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, among others, could affect CompoSecure’s future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in CompoSecure’s forward-looking statements: the ability of CompoSecure to diversify its business and customer base and to achieve enhancements in organic growth and operational efficiency, including for any future acquired companies; the ability of CompoSecure to create value for its shareholders and generate robust free cash flow; the ability of CompoSecure to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees; the possibility that CompoSecure may be adversely impacted by other global economic, business, competitive and/or other factors; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against CompoSecure or others; future exchange and interest rates; and other risks and uncertainties, including those under “Risk Factors” in filings that have been made or will be made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CompoSecure undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** This press release may include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. CompoSecure believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in evaluating CompoSecure’s financial performance. CompoSecure uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and/or to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling CompoSecure to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Due to the forward-looking nature of the financial guidance included above, specific quantification of the charges excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance, including with respect to depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes, that would be required to reconcile the non GAAP financial measures included in such financial guidance to GAAP measures are not available, so it is not feasible to provide accurate forecasted non-GAAP reconciliations without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included, and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included. In addition, CompoSecure’s debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. CompoSecure believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are significant components in understanding and assessing CompoSecure’s financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of CompoSecure’s liquidity and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of GAAP measures to these non-GAAP measures.\n\nCorporate ContactAnthony PiniellaHead of Communications, CompoSecure(917) 208-7724apiniella@composecure.com\n\nInvestor Relations ContactSean Mansouri, CFAElevate IR(720) 330-2829CMPO@elevate-ir.\n\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Data(in thousands)  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**  \n**Unaudited**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCURRENT ASSETS  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 52,674| $| 41,216  \nAccounts receivable, net| 43,799| 40,488  \nInventories| 55,090| 52,540  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 5,248| 5,133  \nTotal current assets| 156,811| 139,377  \nProperty and equipment, net| 23,062| 25,212  \nRight of use assets, net| 5,929| 7,473  \nDeferred tax asset| 245,102| 23,697  \nDerivative asset -
