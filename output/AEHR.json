Silicon carbide wafer level burn-in test systems and full wafer contactors are poised to be key contributors to revenue again this year. We are also forecasting material bookings and revenue contributions from several other markets this fiscal year, as we are successfully executing on our strategy to expand our test and burn-in products into other large and fast-growing markets such as artificial intelligence processors, gallium nitride power semiconductors, hard disk drive components and flash memory devices.\n\n“We have been seeing a stabilization and increasingly positive discussions within the silicon carbide power semiconductor market over the past quarter. Electric vehicle (EV) suppliers are clearly moving towards silicon carbide in integrated modules, combining silicon carbide MOSFETs into single packages to meet the industry’s power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness demands. Due to the need for extensive test and burn-in of these devices to ensure reliability for mission-critical applications like EVs, the benefits of conducting this screening at the wafer level before integrating them into modules, which may sometimes contain 32 or more other devices, are becoming clear. The process improves yields and reduces costs, driving demand for wafer level burn-in, an area where Aehr Test stands as the low-cost leader and proven solution for this critical testing. We are highly optimistic about our silicon carbide business and expect it to gain momentum over the next few quarters. Our silicon carbide customers are forecasting capacity expansion needs in calendar 2025, with several anticipating purchases of one or two systems in early 2025, followed by production volumes in the second half of the year, and ramping further into 2026.\n\n“Meanwhile, we continue to see strong demand for our FOX WaferPakTM full wafer Contactors for silicon carbide, driven by a record number of new device designs started this past quarter. These designs are expected to lead to additional WaferPak purchases for engineering qualification as well to volume production orders as they advance to production. We had another solid quarter for WaferPak sales, generating over $12 million in revenue from WaferPaks in the first quarter.\n\n“We are also making steady progress on our previously announced benchmarks and engagements with new silicon carbide device and module suppliers. We are confident that we will add several new silicon carbide customers this year, establishing our solution as their tool of record for volume production. Additionally, silicon carbide is gaining traction in applications beyond electric vehicles, such as solar, industrial, and data centers, which will expand our addressable markets.\n\n“We are now in negotiations with our first gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor customer for volume production wafer level test and burn-in of their devices. This past year, this customer purchased a significant number of WaferPaks to successfully qualify a wide range of GaN device types aimed at multiple markets, including consumer, industrial, and automotive. In addition, we have had increased discussions and engagements with multiple potential new GaN suppliers. We believe GaN is a significant up and coming technology for power semiconductors. With a forecasted CAGR of more than 40% to over $2 billion in GaN devices sold annually by 2029, it has the potential to be a significant market opportunity for Aehr’s wafer level solutions.\n\n“Last quarter, we announced that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator company committed to evaluating our FOXTM solution for wafer level burn-in of their high-power processors. This evaluation is underway at our Fremont facility, where multiple wafers are being tested using our proprietary WaferPaks and new high-power FOX-XP and NP systems, which provide up to 3500 watts of power delivery and thermal control per wafer. We are delivering over 2000 amperes of current to a single 300 mm wafer, allowing us to burn-in numerous processors with our proprietary test modes. The evaluation is progressing very well, and once we demonstrate successful wafer level test results and throughput, we anticipate they will adopt our high-power FOX-XP systems for production of their next-generation AI processors, beginning this fiscal year.\n\n“During the quarter we announced and completed our acquisition of Incal Technology, Inc. We are excited to bring the combined strengths of both companies to market as we begin engaging with Incal’s customers, including many AI industry leaders. Customer feedback to this acquisition has been overwhelmingly positive, with several meetings held over the past few weeks where some customers indicated increased forecasts for engineering qualification as well as for volume production.\n\n“Last month, we were pleased to announce the first volume production orders for Incal’s new Sonoma ultra-high-power semiconductor packaged part test and burn-in solution designed for AI accelerators, graphics processors, network processors, and high-performance computing processors. These orders were placed by a large-scale data center hyperscaler that provides computing power and storage capacity to millions of users worldwide. The integration with Incal is progressing well. We have already shipped several systems since the acquisition, and we plan to consolidate personnel and manufacturing into Aehr’s Fremont facility by the end of the fiscal year.\n\n“Last quarter, we announced a key customer in the hard disk drive space that is now forecasting a production ramp-up starting this fiscal year for a new high-volume data storage device application. This customer is finalizing their capacity requirements, and we expect this ramp-up to drive orders for multiple FOX-CP production systems and WaferPak Contactors, with shipments likely occurring in the second half of this fiscal year. We see the data storage market, along with various devices supporting the global 5G expansion, as new growth opportunities for our systems, as these markets require devices with exceptionally high levels of quality and long-term reliability.\n\n“With all of these customer engagements, market opportunities, and the products to address them, we are very optimistic about the year ahead, and we are reaffirming our financial guidance for revenue growth and profitability for the year.”\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Financial Guidance:**\n\nFor the fiscal year ending May 30, 2025, Aehr is reiterating its previously provided guidance for total revenue of at least $70 million and net profit before taxes of at least 10% of revenue.\n\n**Management Conference Call and Webcast:**\n\nAehr Test Systems will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2025 operating results.
